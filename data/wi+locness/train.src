My town is a medium size city with eighty thousand inhabitants .
It has a high density population because its small territory .
Despite of it is an industrial city , there are many shops and department stores .
I recommend visiting the artificial lake in the certer of the city which is surrounded by a park .
Pasteries are very common and most of them offer the special dessert from the city .
There are a comercial zone along the widest street of the city where you can find all kind of establishments : banks , bars , chemists , cinemas , pet shops , restaurants , fast food restaurants , groceries , travel agencies , supermarkets and others .
Most of the shops have sales and offers at least three months of the year : January , June and August .
The quality of the products and services are quite good , because there are a huge competition , however I suggest you taking care about some fakes or cheats .
Everyone has his own plans .
People want to be a doctor , other want to be a teacher .
I have my own plan too but I do n't same to them , I want to become a Journalist .
Working as a Journalist is very exciting because many reasons .
First , I will have an opportunity to live abroad .
Second , I can travel all around the world , meet different people who are very friendly .
Next , I will have a chance appear in big parties or events and I can make friends with famous person - It 's interesting !
Finally , I will have high salary when I am Journalist .
To be Journalist , I must study very hard so I 'll try to learn in order to make my dream comes true .
In the future , I 'll become a journalist .
Now days each family has more then 1 car for each one , this is only one of few reason that people use less public transport .
Before was really convenient to go by bus or by train but with the new economy the travel tickets are more expensive and a big difference from the past is that it is less expensive to go far then near .
I remember from my town Palermo in Italy to go to Milan was about 340 pounds , now if we are lucky we can arrive to New York .
In England where I live , in Bedford , we use a lot the train to go in the most important town of UK , but the train are very expensive , me and my family stay careful if we go off pick because the price are to high .
I 'm sure in the future there will be car able to fly or you can park them in your pocket .
Furthermore , the biggest group of positive feeling students in the present is live with various nationalities .
The possible reason is these international students can not speak English flowing .
They usually lack of language and can not open a debate .
It is restrict to argue .
In the other side , they might be wanted to safeguard national image .
In order to give a good image and show the national parenting , our respondents tend to have a great pardon to other nationalities .
MORE THAN KIP FIT !
Do you know mountain biking ?
Perhaps you think it 's only a sport .
You 're wrong .
Follow reading to know why!.
I 'm keen on mountain biking since three years ago .
Firstly , I tried with a rental bike in the area of Aznalcazar .
The main reason why I wanted to prove was to lose weight ( I was a bit overweight ) .
However , it was wonderful how I could admire the landscape while I was doing sport .
Consequently , I realized that although ciclyng outside helped me to improve my fitness , really I enjoyed the best breathing pure air and taking pleasure the countryside .
If someone wants to take up this sport , first of all , I would recommended him or her to pursue a good mountain bike .
It 's important to avoid accidents , become comfortable and have a good journey .
Secondly , he or she would buy a good helmet and , of course , appropriate clothing .
I love this sport . I look forward to the weakened , to go out with my bike and my group of friends .
All of us spend a good time .
And I would like to encourage everybody to prove .
Nobody wo n't regret it .
Lucy Keyes
Lucy Keyes was the last thriller I 've seen .
I do n't recommend it to children lower than thirteen years old ,
because it 's difficult to understand ; for example , the characters are ,
Lucy , Molly , and their parents , a cowboy , and a teacher .
The movie is about Lucy 's family that moves into a farmhouse , mysterious and
scary .
Also reflects a comparison of Lucy 's family , and characters
from a story their mom read often .
The story actually takes place in a camp , and farmhouse , mysteriously
used in other times .
It 's interesting because Lucy 's mom discovered a wall in their farm , that
had a weird painting of two sisters just like her 's , the same ones also of the
story she read .
I recommend this movie only to teenagers older than thirteen years old ..
The best place for young people in our aree is without doubt the lake .
Here they can do many kinds of sport : swimming , sailing , surfing , kiting , rowing and many others .
At least they can meet other folks and relax , have a sunbathe and listen to the music .
In the summer around the lake are so many concerts so you have the difficulty finding the right one .
Luckily the scouls are closed per ten weeks so the young girls and boys have much time to spend the
leisure time together .
Dear husband ,
I hope you 're fine .
I remember all of you and miss my family .
Leaving my country , Soamlia , was very hard for me .
I miss my big house but I do n't miss the guns .
I hope to return to my country and see you again .
In the following decades revolution and civil smote many of the Powers of Europe , and new nations were born .
Britain alone escaped almost unscathed from these years of unrest .
There was an unparalleled expansion of the English - Speaking Peoples both by birth and emigration .
I really like to travel , but I like the most when I travel with friends .
I a very good experience .
I love to travel with my family .
is different to tavel with friends that travel with family .
I do not travel too much with my friends .
I just have had traveled two times .
Those two times has been with the orchestra that I play .
Once we went to Zacatecas .
We went there because the university orchestra from UAZ invited us to go there and play with them .
In that time I did not know nobody , just one .
Her name is irixhi .
She was my friend , because we are from the same town .
But when I was there I began to make new friends that I never thougth I was going to have , and I never thoungth the way that I was going to know them eather . at the begining I felt very strange talking with them , but now we are very good friends .
We stayed in Zacatecas like a week we really had a good time .
The second trip that I made was to Guerrero .
We went to play to Acapulco , to an event that unuversities from Mexico go and present like cultural activities .
There was too hot .
In Acapulco I had a good time because I stay in the same room that my friends and we swam a lot and we really had fun .
Then we went to Taxco .
There we visit the central park and we stay in a very luxury hotel .
We were very happy there we really like Taxco .
Actually I was already been there before but not with my friends .
Then we went to Cacahuamilpa to play there that was an incledible experience that I will never forget .
then we return to Toluca to continue with my boring life .
And now I have to pass my subjects .
We hope to go to Colombia next year .
I like biathlon .
Really , I think it 's a very beautiful , interesting and breathtaking kind of sport .
In biathlon sportsmen need to run some races , which a very different , some of that are long , some are short .
But , short distance does n't mean it 's will be easy or something like that .
Sometimes weather conditions are not comfortable for guys , for example : wind , light frog or freeze , all of that are very difficult conditions .
So , it 's not so easy like it seems .
That 's why I like it .
This sport are for real men .
And also most of them are very attractive , big advantage for girls , whose like nice pictures .
There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
That is what everyone say when we ask if they prefer public transport or car .
Using public transport can be not easy , because we have a strict time and normally we do not have a place to sit and that can be extremely desconfortable .
Sometimes the employers do strike and we clients do not known in time as a result we can not get on time to work , that is one of the disadvantages of using public transport .
One argument for not using the car is that the petrol price is very expensive , but the public transport tickets are also increasing , so that advantange are not so good actually .
For me car is the best and you ?
Well however your choice is , it is necessary to be perfect for your daily life !
However you use Have a nice trip !
People usually tell me I 'm a cinema 's enthusiast , and they are in the correct way . I prefer to spend my free time watching a good film especially when it is a thriller than doing sport ,
If you want to see a good thriller , " Regression " will be your best option . I have seen it recently and in my opinion , it should be seen by everyone because I believe people would like it for many reasons .
First of all , the director , who was Alejandro Amenábar , did a great job due to that , the spectators were waiting with bated breath as the final of this film will be .
Secondly , the actors were fantastic and the main character , which was performed by Emma Watson ( who is really hilarious ) , was amazing .
What 's more , the plot is easy in order to understand .
The history took place in the USA a few years ago when the regression method was accepted by the doctors and cientifics .
Moreover , customs , make - up and special effects became ever more in reality the story .
However , the soundtrack was awful , it did n't get having a scared .
In conclusion , my recommendation for the student film club is this fabulous and exciting thiller must be seen if you had spent a good time given than it achieves keeping in suspense until the end and it does n't be afraid .
In addition , you wo n't have better opportunity to see it than this week , because just moment in Spain the festival 's cinema is happening .
You should take advantage of that !
In my opinion , public transport in my country will never improve because my country is so poor and beside it is considered one of third world countries and another think must be taken into consideration is they the politicians are horrible they have destroyed my country
When we ask ourselves , how can we take care of the environment ?
The first thing that we think is the pollution , the car smoke , factory smoke , etc ... but , have we thought in the food or clothes ?
perhaps when we are buying in the supermarket or other shops we are doing something bad , because we ask to assistant a bag o similar to carry at home this food or other things .
We can take a bag from our house , because if we do this every time that we are going to buy in each shop , we do n't spend more piece of plastic or paper .
But we do n't have forgotten the cotamination by cars , We can use more the bicycle or public transportetion .
Also in the sort way , we should go walking to the destination.icle
If we are working with sameone in the same jobs , and who lives near or he is our neighbour , we can go to the work in the same car , this way we use less oil .
The governents are also important for taking care of the environment .
They should have healthy habits and with their examples they can improve the habits of the population .
I love sports but I did not get much opportunities to play a sport . I born in a village in India , my parents are farmers like most of other villagers .
The only play ground in our village was the school ground which was full of small rock and not good to play any sports .
When I was a child I help my father on his jobs after my school .
We bought television in 1888 , after that I became a fan of cricket .
I was watching most of the matches .
Sachin and Ganguly was my favorite cricketers , I love their batting .
A MISTAKE
It was summer holidays and Michael 's family was in the airport waiting impatiently their flight to Mexico .
That was a special family it was so big ; his father has 6 brothers ! , so he has 17 cousins counting his little sister .
In total they were 32 pelople , a white kittie and a dog .
About 10 minutes later they started to get bored , they heard a girl calling they to enter the plane .
The flight to Mexico was incredible , and very funny .
Michael used to have a great time with his cousins , except with Tom .
That was because Tom liked to give orders to everyone , and Michel did n't liked that .
When the big family get out of the plane , they realize that they were wearing too much clothes , it was boiling ! !
There they took a taxi to the hotel , and at 4 pm .
the family was walking around the luxurious hotel .
SOme minutes later they designate how the cousins were going to share the rooms .
Michael finally ended with the last one he would like to ; Tom .
That night , the dog , the kittie , Tom and Michel slept in the same room , and that was n't too bad .
When Michael get up in the morning , he realize that his kittie had disapeared , and he found Tom 's dog with some white hair in his mouth .
He thought that the dog had eaten the kittie during the night , so he shouted to Tom , open the door and went away .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake
One of the best restaurants I 've ever been to is Spizharka .
It is situated in the very centre of our city and offers a wide variety of dishes and drinks .
The service is really great .
The waitresses are helpful and smiling .
You feel like you are at home !
Warm candle light and small tables with patterned table clothes create friendly atmosphere .
The dishes are n't very expensive .
i believe it is suitable for our class
So , my favourite sport in the present time it is street workout . I have been exercising this sport already long time .
I like to exercise on the street even in the season when the temperature outside below zero .
Of course , in summer I like to exercise more than in winter but this do n't stop me .
I do n't know myself why , but I almost every day go on the street in order to exercise .
If It is very coldly and windily outside , I do n't worry about it and I 'm exsercising at home .
For those people , who want to start to exercise the street workout I 'm advising to start with basic exerscises such as pull ups , push ups , dips and squats .
That everything basic exercises and they will help you will do a good start up .
After some time when you will be feeling that you are ready for more , you can start to study more difficult exercises .
So , it 's my first attempt to create English text !
I dare say what I was quite self - confident a few months ago .
But now not .
What 's the reason ?
Because of mind .
I was n't satisfied with your behavior .
Sometimes , a lot of phrases and sentences runs in my head , but how to write it down correctly ?
How can I use to use it ?
How can I force my kids to do his homework ?
How can I explain them ?
Michael is a handsome and kind person .
He lives next to his family 's home .
Michael got married his close friend since only one month .
But his mother hate his wife and always shout at her .
Unlike his wife respect and love his mother and never complain to her husband these bad situations .
Michael 's only fault that he is a mamma 's boy .
For he always defend his mother and always the wife is the responsible one .
His wife decided , because she loves him , to forgive and apologize for her mother - in - law .
One day when Michael was out for work , his mother insulted and hit his wife .
Moreover she fired her without her mobile or money .
His wife was sad and she cried a lot and she stood on street waiting for Michael .
Once he came , his mother asked him to up quickly acting that she was tired .
He saw his wife but said no words to her and continued hi way .
His wife walked behind him until they reach home but his mother claimed that his wife told her cruel words and acted that she was crying .
Michael believed his mother although he observed marks of hitting on his wife 's shape .
He fired his wife after insulting her .
She was shocked and apologized about a mistake she did not commit .
But his mother refused her apology and ordered him to close the door .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
The light bulb .
The light bulb was created on 1879 by Thomas Alva Edison .
This was one of the everyday invents that affects our lives .
Edison said to created the first comercially practical incandescent light .
He was neither the first nor the only person trying to invent an incandescent light bulb .
Some historians claim there were 20 over inventors of incandescent lamps prior to Edison 's version but Edison is often credited with the invention because his version was able to outstrip the earlier versions because of a combination of three factors : " an effective incandescent material , a higher vacuum than others were able to achieve and a high resistance that made power distribution from a centralized source economically viable . "
( taken from www.bulbs.com )
Edison began a serious research about the incandescent light bulb on October of 1878 , and his original design were in 1879 .
Edison and his research team did his discovery comercialy and create a company called " Edison Electric Light Company " .
I think what this is the most useful invention because without this we ca n't live like we live actually .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Tom friend of Peter suddenly fainted fell down in the class room I do n't know what to do immediately , first calm down yourself and I checked his pulse beat it is okay , then I knew that he is out of danger so I called my classmates everyone rushing to the spot but still he is not moving so we decide to take him into the hospital or call the ambulance , finally we call the ambulance without ant delay .
Everyone eagerly waiting for the ambulance arrival but still not yet reached the reason is our college location is little far from the city that 's why it is getting late .
We were waiting patiently , finally the ambulance arrived and take him into the hospital immediately .
Lately I have seen a very interesting announcement in International Sports Monthly magazine .
I was interested if I could write such an article and win a prize .
And I decided to try .
Nowadays healthy way of life is very popular with most people all over the world .
And as for me I 've been going in for sport for several years .
What is my favourite kind of sport ?
It 's ordinary bodybuilding .
Why did I choose it ?
I want to be fit and have a good health .
I lost several kilos and I could wear my favourite clothes .
It became possible for me to run easily .
I 'd like to give advice to everybody not to sit at home and watch TV .
Go to sports gyms , be active and you will feel in another way .
You will forget about doctors and expensive medicine .
Sport is like drugs .
If you do n't have training for a long time your body will feel something unusual .
Your muscles will be strong and you 'll be able to fulfil any difficult job .
People will look at your figure enviously .
Describe your bedroom .
My bedroom is quite big .
The wall of my bedroom are white and the floor is dark grey .
In my bedroom there is a brown bed , a yellow drowers , a little light brown bedside table and a big brown wardrobe .
On the wall there are some pictures of my family , but I do n't nave any posters .
I am living at São Carlos , in the countryside of São Paulo , from Brazil .
In my city the environment 's protection is so difficult .
First of all , we have an extinction area of cerrado closer to Federal University of São Carlos , but sometimes , the area will be used to construct a new building of University .
We have done several movements , but sometimes is not worked .
Secondly , the Hall does n't matter with the environment ; for example , the Hall stopped with garbage 's selection collection when the new major assumeded the hall .
It demonstrate the effort was done in the last 10 years it was over because the new political position of the major .
It is so stupid because the environment need to be over then political position .
Third , we have not founded a green political to eliminate rubbish .
Instead to use a selective collection of garbage , or recycling of materials , or the sanitary landfill ; we have used the dumpfill that is prejudice the soil .
At last , the population , in majority of the times , does n't matter to throw away the garbage on the street or in a prohibited area .
In conclusion , in my city , the concern of the environment 's protection do not working how it is necessary to protection of soil , environment and healthy .
Environment is the sorrounding.there is no aleartness in our locality.they were busy in their own work.everyone were not focus or see what hapening in our place.they use to speak about how hot today is?but they do nt know what makes this much hot.iam interest in planting tree and makes sorrounding clean.some people used to burn forest as if those forest is useless.man are greedy because of all the thing getting from the forest are free .
They damcare about environment because that does n't gave anything to them .
Managemant acountant practice is very important for organization to making decision about human resources , sales , marketing and potential customers .
Most of the organizations known how is affect managemant acountant practice on them work , therefore they are chossing good programme and employee .
I have been in the USA last year , first in order to look for a job as a pharmacist but also , having a lot of time to explore a new world .
I spent about two years there , but I wanted to come back to Italy because I missed my home .
At first , I had called a travel agent but he said he could n't be able to book me a flight before two months , so I called my brother who heavily regret me for not having told him about the trip and he promised me he would have booked a flight sooner than that good for nothing agent .
I believed in him , but I did n't know how I was wrong .
He had booked me the flight but he did n't pay for it , because in that moment he had n't got cash enough on him .
The worst thing was to find it out at the airport .
I had never felt so nervous !
Environment is always a hurting problem in the world .
There are company so much , they make our life polluted .
To take care of the environment , each of us has to do anything such as propaganda to the people in the country, ... about my village , we use banana leaf stead of nilon , garbage desposal sensibly ... and so on .
we should clean our area to attract visitor and introduce to many other countries in the world.let protect our lung

This summer happened to me several things , I went to the beach , I went to the pool , or simply went for a walk with friends , but the best was when I went to a wedding because it was the event that more memories bring me this summer .
We got there at five o'clock , we had not yet reached many people , so take the opportunity to give the gift that was a washing machine the finished clothing to reach the store , and apparently they were in need of a new , as the bride loved .
Spent half an hour after we arrived , started coming everybody , there were many greetings , thanks , hugs , kisses , and then we all went to the table , which was magnificently structured , plenty of food of all kinds , drinks , but we were all waiting for the main course , also the food was magnificent , but the best part was when the couple went to the pool , we were lucky we had an amazing wedding planner who arranged the magnificent and fun activities , he said to the bride and groom enter each an inflatable ball and try walking on the water as long as withstand , and the bride won because the groom slipped and fell after them , out of the ball , fell into the water , and kissed .
At four in the morning , after opening the presents , everyone started to leave , it was a long day but a lot of fun , but it could have lasted a bit longer .
I usually wake up at six o'clock in the morning , then I 'll take a quick shower .
After school , I 'd like to eat fresh fruit .
I am keen to run during the night time .
IN my country peole do alot of mistake and have alot of of bad habits concerning their attitude towards the rubbish , they are always throwing their old things and rubbish in public place , the governement also can not do their role towards their people and their bad behaviour
Once upon a time , there was a monster on the city called " Michenstain " .
Michenstain was a very tiny city that was one bad thing for them ; the other bad thing was that in the city , there was a monster called " Monsteration " .
Monsteration was a very lively monster he always migrates to the north every Monday .
In the day , he was a mild monster , he was very visible ( because he was big ) ; but in the night , it was the contrary , he kill people , destroys complete cities ; he smash all the architecture from the city , and a lot of bad things .
One day , Monsteration 's next destination was the city of Michenstain .
All the people did n't know what that was , so they did n't care about it .
But when he arrived to Michenstain , all the people went : " DAHMMMMMMMMMM " .
It was in the midnight when arrived , so he was eager to destroy everything .
So all the people started to run and scream , and the monster was pursuing all of them .
He was spoiling all the crops from the people , he was destroying all the vehicles , and he destroyed a vast area .
The next day , he was a very attractive monster , in other words , he was convert in other monster body .
He was completely different ; it was impressive the way he was acting .
The thing that he ( the monster ) did n't know about was that he had a spectacular infection ( literally spectacular ) that I thing that it have no cure , it was called " The Monsteration Infectations " .
( On those times there were diverse monster , but none of them was like him ; he was in the number 1 rank of the monster in destroying things . )
The scientists are trying to make a cure for the Monsteration Infectations , but they still do n't have it .
In their laboratory , they have a lot of chemicals that were prohibited in their country , but they used them .
They had to isolate the chemicals to the formula to have the cure .
Some scientists did n't care about the infection ; they were playing ultimate team in their iPods .
The scientists that were doing the formula had a lot of tension , but finally , they did it and they said : " Magnificent " .

On Thursday , September 11 , the term exams finished and our week of vacation started .
In the afternoon I went to my dance classes .
it was fun because we learn a new hip hop dance and we finished our tap dance .
On Friday I went to the mall with my family .
I bought one sweater and two jeans .
Later I went to the book store and bought three books ; " legend " , " wonder " , and " Eleanor & Park " .
On the weekend I stay at home . I start reading " Eleanor & Park " ; it was amazing , I was laughing a lot because the things that the characters said .
The other things I do were sleeping , ate , and watch TV .
The next day I went with my friends to see a movie .
We saw " if I stay " and I loved it .
The movie is about a teenager named Mia that had a car accident with her family .
Her father and her mother died before they arrive to the hospital .
Mia survive but she is in a coma and she have to decide if she wants to live without her mother and father or if she wants to die .
Later in the week I pass the day drawing .

The next days I did n't do much .
I just sleep and watch movies at home .
The day before I start school , I do an investigation for literature class .

As per the today topic " No Future for public transport " , I would like to add comments on that please be patient my English is not too good as you readers think .
So , lets start ,
Most of the Metro cities are now days attract people of city towards Metro only not just because of the fare but because of the time that it saves .
Now these days public would not like to travel in the public Transport to save their time as well as money .
Metro is good for even health of the people as no pollution and all because it runs on electricity and also it connect most of the city as Delhi has a wide area span of Metro that is really awesome .
Other than that public transport is also not good for Natural resources which is not good for the future of the country .
If you visit Taiwan , you will never miss the temples here .
There are so many temples here .
So , now there is a chance for you to pretend the god .
Jiu - Tian Folk Arts Group is a group of people who are good at our traditional performance , which is " imitate the faces and pose as gods " .
In here , they will teach you how to draw the face of god , dance like god , and beat the drum .
Curious ?
Just come and give it a try !
I think pay expensive tax on personal car can reduce the use of cars or other vehicles in order solve the traffic problems .
Because all people like money , for example , many people do n't buy car with expensive tax , so people must use the public transportation , such as bus , subway .
The public transportation will rich , so they can build more station for suburban and more public car to carry this .
Therefore traffic will be batter .

there is no way to travel from Egypt to the USA using a car .
a plane may take about 16 hours .
a car may take days or months for the same distance .
I really overwhelm to be third member of my small family- Peter , Maria , both of which are my parents in 45 years of the same age and my little brother , Patrick-14 year old in a mischievous manner .
Their gentle norm with lovely and adorable mind take a reference to their hobbies - reading .
Nowadays a person 's worth seems to be judge according to the social status and material possessions , that is mostly to happen in high class famiies , as they are foccus on achievements as power , political influences etc . on the other hand for a middle class families the old - fashioned values are still important as it is the inheritance from our ancestors in terms of values as honesty , kindness , loyalty , etc .
Metro is the most comfortable way of transportation in Moscow .
Metro is only one that I use in the city .
Using a ground transportation is not comfortable because of traffic .
Just a few years ago we started to use a special road line .
But the problem is Russian drivers are not getting used to keep this line free .
Moscow traffic is awful .
Everyone is in a hurry .
There is no difference if you use car or bus .
For example American public transport has a special line and a schedule and it works like a train , I mean come in exact time like a train .
That 's my dream"when I joined the faculty of languages and translation I was very happy because I achieved my dream .
In this faculty I faced some problems with my english , I began to ask " How can I improve my english ? "
all of the answer was " you have to listen and read so you can write and speak well " I said okay I have to depend on myself , I began to join groups on facebook where I found some of the people shared their knowledge with others , I followed them immediately .
I am in my way to improve my english , I ask Allah to guide me to the right way .
My dream is that I want to open a Center for Language Learning ,
to teach children and adults in my country good English and I will avoid traditional education .
the best thing that can encourage me to open this center that I have in my country 5 friends who study in the faculty of languages and translation and I think that they will be very happy for joining me in my center .
I know that is a very amazing dream but I pray Allah to give me all means to achieve my future dream .

One day in October , Michael a boy was studying architecture discovered a box with a message , while he is opening a box , he heard a door .
In this moment a big man went into the bedroom .
This man was his father , who had dead .
Michael was very nervous and confused because he did n't understand anything .
He spoke with his father and he asked him because he was there and his father responded that he had the biggest secret about his family .
" In the past Matilde your mother killed your brother , although she had a reason , he was a monster because he killed a lot of people in our city , so we went to another city . "
But Michael did not believe this story and he thought that he was crazy .
This situation was impossible because his father had dead and in this moment he ran and he opened the door and his father said you must be here because I must speak with you more time and explain because I can speak with you but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .

How are you ?
Today we received a shipment from Visual service center under our old account number , it could be a mistake by service center as a notice regarding major organizational restructure already sent to service centers .
In issued notice it clearly states that all defect parts should be sent to Slovakia with effect from 01/06/2015 .
If any more shipments are returned using our old TNT account number , there is no option other than invoicing service center for not following instructions .
So please advise all service centers to return defect parts to Slovakia instead of England .
Nowadays , sport is very important part our life .
Many doctors recommended the practice of sport , because it is very healthy for our body and for mind .
Every day , there are many articles and news information that talking about the benefits that you get if you practise sport .
My favourite sport is swimming because as soon as start this sport you feel better .
In spite of you do n't lost weight , you can win endurance and flexibility .
When I am stay in water I feel free and very hastily .
Not only is sport when you feel sweaty , but also you do a lot of exercise .
However , you do n't have the feeling that you are very tired , is different , at the same time is fantastic !
On the one hand , my advice that I would give to someone starting my favourite sport , swimming , is that you need a little will power because sometimes , for example in winter , you will not want to go to the gym , let alone you get in a pool !
On the other hand , my other advice is that I am very sure that you will feel wonderful and happy!May be not at first time , but sure later .
I promise you that it will be this way .
In conclusion , sport is very necessary and useful for you can improve your life .
You start and then you explain to me how are you ?

Public transport have improved the regional development since the past decade , it 's convenient and necessary for a city life .
But when it comes to travel , it 'll be more convenient if you have a car , because you will not like to go where everybody goes .
If you have a car , you can go anywhere you want and stop by any beautiful spot you like .
It 's more flexible for your travel plan .
And , it 's really enough development in our planet , it would be better if we can leave some place blanked , we do n't need so much convenient transportation , and we can still live well .
Save some nature to the earth , and leave clear air for our kids .
Build public transport in a city , not in a country .
My favorite sport game is Cricket .
It is very important and very enjoyable game .
Today cricket is very famous game in the world .
Among them cricket is very famous in Sri Lanka .
We could go to in the world from cricket .
It is very great .
Today we have clever cricketers and famous amperes than other countries .
It is very valuable .
Australia , England , South Africa and New Zealand are very famous country for cricket game .
But those countries are very developed and they have any facilities .
But Sri Lanka is developing country yet .
They have no facilities than other countries .
But Sri Lanka cricket team could won the World cup 2014 .
It is very important opportunities in our countries .
So as I think I can enjoy in cricket than other games .
You can start the cricket game .
And you can earn more money and you can go to other countries .
Today we have lots of sports games .
Volley ball , Net ball , Elle , Table tennis , Karate , etc .
But it is not famous and we could n't go to in the world .
But cricket is very famous and we know any cricketers .
We can be a famous and earn more money .
Cricket is good for our health than other games .
In my opinion cricket is best for you . You can be a good cricketer .
You do not what to do ?
Are you a tourist ?
Are you lost in the city without knowing what to do ?
If I am right continou reading this .
We have a lot of shopping facilities , it is the good thing about living in a big city like Madrid , because we have a lot of different shops since clothes shops , pets shops , food shops , shoes shops , accessories shops , toys shops , presents shops and much more types of shops that know I can not remember , but you can find almost all you want or you need it is not incredible ?
But for some of them you have to search very well because some of the shops are unique and some other are very good hidden , but for that you have specialized transports that will take you to wherever you want or you need to go
Hi ,

It was such a great experience for me .
I applied in one music club in our city and I was really excited when they repplied and asked me to help because I enjoy going to rock concerts and I was truly curious about how the backstage is working .
What was mny job ?
Mostly I helped others an carried the stuff .
I enjoyed working with a soundmaster so far .
It was quite stressful but at the end of the concert the atmosphere was amazing .
People were singing and shouting - they all seem to be really happy .
I hope I will do that again once .
See you arrond

Hi Jo ,
It 's really nice that you are asking me about it .
Poland is really beautiful and you choose it wisely .
I suggest that you can start your trip from Warsaw .
It 's heart of Poland and you will learn everything about work , education and people from here .
Every big city in Poland is very similar to each other .
If you want to relax you can also go to mountains or sea .
Even there you can meet really nice people and talk with them .
But let 's talk about work there .
We appreciate kind and hard working people .
But you ca n't expect that they are going to pay you a lot of money .
Rate is pretty low .
But there is a chance that you can meet generous people .
Take care
Ola

In this essay I would like to highlight how a wide range of public transport can help people to save a bit of money and a lot of stressful hours stuck in the traffic jam .
Firstly as everybody know the cost of the fuel is increasing more and more , adding to those the bill that own a car will bring , it became immediately clear that it is cheaper go around by public transport .
Why then there still be so many people who prefer to drive their own car instead of seat comfortably on the train or on the tube reading their favorite book on their way to work ?
I would say that this is because the public transport are not so efficient as the should do .
In my town for example , I have been Waiting for up to forty minutes before I could take a bus .
I strongly believe that it is a shame because a lot of people like me would live their vehicles at home and take a train instead .
Secondly , the environment would improve its state indeed , as far as I can see the pollution caused by the traffic is ruining monuments and making the air dirty and heavy , the same is as far as waste of time is concerned , obviously the fewer cars are around the quicker you can get where you want .
In conclusion I would really like that politicians who care about public transport will improve the services so that more people could leave their vehicles at home and move around much more easily .
The problem is that if everyone thinks that traveling by car is convenient , absolutely everyone will go everywhere by car , and the roads will become chockablock .
You see man , I do n't like crowded roads , a nd prefere to travel by tram .
It is cheap and eloquence .
I play basketball on weekends since I am little .
I also like to play baseball , too .
I can play basketball and baseball like no tomorrow .
I usually play baseball with a group of my friends .
I play with them on the playground .
I ca n't image the life without sports .
In the today society .
The most people are travelling by their car , because the public transport was not convenient for people to use .
Maybe , in fact the lands are more big , so that the transport had not published to anywhere .
The general transport constructions can divided three levels .
On the lands , the railroad and highway is the go through the most city roads .
In the sea , include the route and port construction .
In the sky , include airplane flights and airport construction .
The transport construction and economic development has a close relationship , and utilized of land are more important .
The development of the railroad and highway are easy to pulished , but construc of seaport and airport must with congenital condition .
When integrate of the economy and land planning are accomplished , the public transport constrcutions are convenient for people to use .
I am going to write about how live is going to change in the next 50 years .
Although we do n't realised we have to be conscious
that every day is a different day if we compare with the one has passed .
Some years ago we did n't use the technology to get in touch with friends and family but nowadays it 's the most important thing for
some people who they ca n't live without it .
I am speaking about the mobile how it changed our life .
It 's normal
that in the next 50 years it is going to change .
It will be more advantages in general and it will give us a lot of good things but maybe some bad things too .
To sum up , although we do n't want that our life changed it is normal that it will have different changes .
It is necessary for our lives to have or to feel that we are getting better .
My favourite sport is chess because it is the only game for our mind .
It also helps us in studies .
I agree that it 's not physical exercise but a mental one .
There are many physical exercises like swimming but name any game except chess that makes our mind sharp .
I like many other games but the best one is this .
I am not saying that we should always play chess as physical activities are also important .
The reason why I would advise someone this sport is that the children who are not interested in there studies or would not be able to study .
In that case chess would help him .It would make child mind sharp and he would not get distract by the surroundings .
Local transportation is one of the most problem in our area .
The local transportation become difficult and expensive .
so the government must take an action to make it easy .
Public media also must educate people the importance of Local translation and how they preserve it .
The Government must save the gasoline and jazz to resolve the problem .
they must find a solution to this difficult problem .
They must maintain roads .
People also have an important role to solve this problem .
They should reserve the energy by using bus instead of using their own cars .
They also can walk or ride a cycle .
Government must maintain the public transportation and make it safe .
We can solve this problem if we want that .
I have thought that writing an article on my favourite sport would be interesting for the readers , above all , and making no differences on the sport you have chosen , it is paramount practising some sport , whatever you choose , such as spinning , that is my favourite sport .
My piece of advice to take up a hobby , in this case a physical hobby , which is interesting for your health .
I rather enjoy spinning , feeling the rhythmn of the music lowder and lowder , this gives me high energy each time I went spinning .
If you want to start practising some sport , first of all think about how much time you are willing to spend on it , then try once and if you are having a good time go ahead and do the most of your time enjoying sport , nevertheless , be careful and go slowly because you might be injured .
the more sport you practise the better you feel , indeed , your mood would not be blue anymore and your body will be thin and gorgeous .
First of all , my opinion is that there is a future for the public transport systems .
If we take a look on the Swiss public transport system , in the bigger cities almost all people go to work by public transport .
The advantage they get is the following : They dont't have to look for parking possibilities , they can leave the bus or the train and a few minutes after they can begin to work .
These people also help to protect the environment by saving our natural resources like petrol .
To conclure , in bigger cities like Bern or Zurich there are no doubts that the public transport system would be less convenient than travelling by car .
The process how to make the notes for the bank can be outlined in six consecutive steps .
First , the bank notes should be considerated how to design included background colour , artwork and security issues .
Then , they are supposed to prepare a skiled machinists .
Subsequently , the sheets of bank notes are printed on the metal plates .
The notes have special link with colour on both sides , which raised images slightly .
The most important step is inspect the notes which are good quality sheets and which are bad sheets .
If the sheets are good , those sheets are then cut into separately and packed into cars in order to dispatach all over the city .
If the sheets are bad , those sheets are then destroyed through burning .
Sport is very important part of a healthy lifestyle .
It keeps our body strong .
Today we have a lot of different sports , so we can choose something that really fits ourselves .
I enjoy running .
It is a kind of thing that everybody can do and it effects all parts of my body .
I literally feel myself stronger after every time I run .
There is no doubt that traffic adds to pollution .
The public transport offers a possible solution for the problem , because much people can transported in one vehicle .
The government has a responsibility to encourage the public to use buses and the underground more .
However , there are a number of changes that need to be considered .
Firstly , public transport should be made free .
The government should raise taxes for pay for the service .
Cars are generally more expensive .
First , I think the public transport is more expensive .
And if we compare the money you spend with the car and the amount that you spend with the public transport , it is less .
Secondly , if you use the car , you haven't wait much time ti catch the bus or the train , and maybe you can arrive later at your job , for this situation .
I believe that use your car has a lot of advantages or benefits , it is more comfartable and less expensive .
last summer i worked at cinema.i think it is a very good job because you can see any films you like for free .
The minus of this work is very big salary and i think that i will work at this cinema on the next summer .
My favourite sport is doing yoga .
I do yoga to aid relaxation .
Yoga calms und vitalizes body and mind .
I do yoga at least one hour every day .
From Monday to Friday I do it at home , at weekends I attend yoga classes .
Yoga is a very convenient sport .
We can do it at any time as we like .
But if you are beginner , it 's better for you to attend regular yoga classes .
You can learn correct Postures in classes .
After doing it skillfully , you can do it at home or any place .
People 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years , Equipment and tools have evolved since the beginning of human history .
In recent decades , however , developments have been particularly groundbreaking , Man has been able to invent machines , which they have been put to work automation is a great help to mankind , because it significantly increases the standard of living and frees people form hard work .
The result is much less work and a better life .
The disadvantage , however , is that because of the machines many people have lost their jobs
Dear Jo
I read your letter , I would like to know some details about what places do you want to visit .
I advise you to visit Queretaro it has had an excellent service with foreign people since five years ago .
Talking about your new job , I was searching some vacancies however it required a job for full - time , so I am going to continue searching some jobs of part - time .
See you when you arrive at Mexico City
Sincerely
Uriel
Nowadays people get around constantly .
It 's better use public transport or private transport ?
Well , ecologists say that get around using transport public is more beneficial for the environment than using the car or motorbike .
In recent years the numbers of people who use public transport has increased a lot , in comparison with ten years ago .
But actually does it has a future ?
It 's more comfortable , faster and preferable than have to run to take the bus , wait the train , etc .
This is a fact which indicates the public transport there is no future in our society .
Other signals are , for example , if you travel by car , you can park the car in front of the place where you want to go .
But if you take the bus , you have to take down in a bus stop , maybe a bit far from where you want to go .
Also it has to say that maybe in the future , technology will create a car that does n't pollute the air , and then , use public transport wo n't be necessary .
yeah i think it 's statement is quite right because every person have car now a days .
transport are are important but car is more reliable for families they went together without waiting for transport .
more flexible with a lot fun with family .
I live in a city named Tangerang it is in Indonesia .
The Indonesia Government itself does n't seem to give a damn about their country 's cleanliness , and the citizen too .
it caused our river some big problems such as disease , unpleasant smell , flood , etc .
i myself , by seeing the river filled with garbage , always seems to be disgusted by the stench and the unpleasant look from the garbage .
And in Tangerang , the air is polluted by Carbon dioxide and the other materials .
And also , after the river , the road in the city is also contaminated by the garbage .
garbage everywhere .
the condition of my country is really critical , I guess .
And the amount of the city 's garden does n't match the amount of the population and pollution in that city .
There are a lot of high - rise building and it provokes flood along the high - rise building 's section .
I wonder if the citizen in my country and town could make a better environment area by throwing garbage on its place and try using an eco - friendly transportation .
And the government , pls do n't be so flabby with your own citizen .
yes , be strict .
I think it 's okay because the purpose of you doing that is to train the citizen to be more responsible for what they did . and , I think it 's enough from me .
I suppose , the government also have studied this situation too .
But they did n't do that much after knowing this truth .
I hope Indonesian government take an action about this situation because if it continues then Indonesia would be the most unclean country over the other countries .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
She looked like happy and she was looking forward to finishing the class to tell her friend what had happened .
After the class Alison joined her friends .
She was very enthusiastic and telling them that Juan , the boy who she was fallen in love , had written a letter for her .
Then the friends could not left to pay attention in the Alison 's words .
She transcribed the letter with a lot of passion because it was evident that Juan was interested in Alison too .
While all girls was hearding to Alison , Juan appeared as a gosh .
Alison was like tomato and all her friends laughed at her .
The boy felt very embarrassed , therefore he carried on his ways and he did not say nothing to her .
Alison always through : " If I would not have told this story to my friends I had passed all evening with Juan "
I think that for the public transport there is a future , because over time the gasoline prices and the value of the reparations of the vehicles increase .
Like in other things the prices increase , from the aliments to clothes and home supplies , gas , water , eletricity .. Then the people will choose the public transport in the future .
My relaxing activity
Swimming has been always my favourite sport .
I used to go to the swimming pool when I was in the school to learn and it became in my favourite activity when I was really tired .
I was with my sister and my friends and I spent a wonderful moment .
Nowadays , I usually go swimming twice a week and I really enjoy swimming because I can chill out and disconnect my mind .
Moreover , it is said to be healthy in order to improve problems in the back so that going swimming is really beneficial for me .
In recent days I found out a gadget to listen to music while I am swimming and it is marvellous because I also love listening to music .
To begginers in this sport I would recommend that a trainer teaches swimming properly because it is very important to pay attention to the position of the arms .
Furthermore , it is necessary to wear glasses .
Swimming is one of the best sport to practise it is due to require all parts of the body .
For this reason , it is a perfect activity to do sport and enjoy .
There are lots of problems in our life .
For example : Transport .
There are lots of kinds of Transportation as Buses , cars , Subways , Trains or taixs .
May be they are comfortable , teribble , essay , dengerous or avrage .
If you are late , you can use subway because it is faster , safer and cheeper .
Cars and buses become dengerous and make Problem in the street .
My view of eating habits .
Why does our brain think about food every day ?
Why have you fridge in every single home ?
Why ..... ?
Every day people thinking about fresh food , fast food , sweet food and many different types of food , why ?
Are you thinking that emotional eating is your bad habits ?
How often do you open your fridge ?
How many times are you going to shop for some snacks ?
What happened with us .....
I remembered that my childhood was very quite , happy around dinner at grandmother 's house .
Really , I told you that I was like a little bit future girl who has dinner regularly with two portion : soup and meal deal .
So we can started from beginning : firstly , was breakfast which included some cereals with hot milk .
Secondly , was lunch at school like sandwich and some fruit .
After I was in home on dinner time and some dessert .
Could you see how easy and regular life I have got .
My " private menu " included fresh eat like salad , fish , fruit and vegetables - many options healthy food .
Now , I am 28 year old woman who does n't has time for normally dinner because I 'm a very busy .
Today , I wake up at 07.00a.m and catch up some of kind bread with jam , drinks a coffee but more than often just has time for half mug and runs to work .
During a day I have lunch which is from can or order some junky food .
Later , I order take away from Chinese buffet or any pizza .
When weekend coming I have a plan for special dinner which is like home made but do n't have time again .
What happened with my healthy life which I want to have when I was a child ?
Why everything look like more difficult and hard than were before ?
Where is our free time and what are you doing with your lifestyle ?
Ten years showed me that I can do everything for myself if it is enough for me ....
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
She went to the station train and get a ticket to London .
she stayed there and read again the note the address was near to the big ben .
When the train came she smiled and goes up and sit .
She turned her haid and saw him " he was fowling me " she thought"well , I should ask him what are he doing here "
" What are you doing here " ask Alison he looks her but with a bad smile , and turn his head
First of all , finishing high school is a passege of life that indicate the begnin of a new chapter for the students .
Since this moment they will have maturity and responsibility .
Therefore , many of them are not ready for this .
So , a lot of parents and students have the opportunity to travel for a year .
When you are travelling around the world by yourself , you won a bagage of knowledge , culture , discorves and , with all of this , you won personal experencie .
Sometimes , these is able to change a person , making that she or he have a new perception of the world .
However , some students do n't have this opportunity to travel , they start to work .
The job , provides , as well the trip , responsibility and experencie .
It changes in a different way the person too .
The consequences are n't good as the reasons , for instance , they may have the career prejudicate , or they spend so many years travelling that they are old to study in a uniersity .
Beside that , they have differents points of view in many sublects , that is why they may don ' like the fun and the conversation in the social life with the other students .
They can not enjoyed this chapter with oung and fresh thoughts .
Finally , to make a decision to not go in a university when you finish the high school , is n't the easiest action to make .
It is a great dedcision , that bring great consequences and great experencies .
Whatever are the choice , they will have the mark in their lifes forever .
Be careful and choice it well .
Public transport is the backbone of a city .
Usually people use public transport to travel around the city .
If in a city people are using more public transport than their own private vehicle then it will help to protect environment and traffic as well .
But now a days automobile companies are more focused on the improvements of the cars so that the can be more environment friendly and traffic friendly .
Future of public transport will be measure on the basis of advancement of the private vehicle .
Sometime people get offended because of the crowd and the inconvenience caused by some people while using public transport .
But main concern will be technology .
Technology is being more advanced .
A car is being made so Eco friendly and user friendly that it is more
Many people said that at school all the students have to start a sport and frequent that one regularly .
Is not a good idea because some students have to study all the afternoon for other subjects and the free time is very scant .
AAs an example if a student need to recuperate a subject or have to take a good mark , they ca n't go to do a sport because there is no time .
In contrast do a sport is very important because we can make new friends or we can start to take responsibility but the most important thing is that we are always active e our body can get good results .
To sum up , do sports is very important for teenagers to which the body is going to grow and do it regularly is commitment that we should take . in my opinion , however , do a sport mandatory is not educational because we must do a sport with enthusiasm not bothered or for obligation
Dear Sir ,
I 'm writing in regard to the watch Fossil FS4735 , similar to FS4812 but with different colours .
I 've seen it a couple of days ago and I was going to buy it , but it has disappeared from your
products list ( I suppose it has been depleted ) .
However , I wonder if you cold tell me when it
would be available again .
Thank in advice for your information .
Yours faithfully
In my opinion , they are not my friend . If your parents are your friends , you would live in harmony with them .
They will consider you as a indpendent people .
Accrodingly , You take responsibitity for what you done .
However , they are not my friends .
There are some reasons , they are not , are as follows .
First of all , I make my every effort to do my job better , however , they only consider that I waste my time doing wrong thing .
Next , they do n't believe my capability is good .
I do everything but nothing .
Finally , they totally do n't listen to what my point is .
They always look at me like a kid never grow up .
It is ridiculous that my parents do n't believe ability .
I am ovewholemed with grief , living with them .
I can not tolerate their pride and prejudice anymore .
I prefer staying alone to living with them .
People often discuss if TV viewing is useful for the education .
In my opinion to watch TV is actually helpful for learning new things .
There is one argument that shows , that the TV promotes us .
The main reason for this is , that the TV is teaching us , because it is an important medium in our lives .
A good example of this are the many informative news , which we are allowed to get .
This clearly shows that the TV is lecturing .
To sum up , TV viewing is not just entertaining at all ; It definitely is also educating .
Many people argue about the use of TV .
Some of them believe that it can only entertain us while others do believe that it can also educate .
However , I think that TV can do both .
I bet if somebody wants to have some fun he or she can just choose the right Chanel or movie such as comedies , video gags or funny TV shows .
Meanwhile if an individual wants to learn from TV .
TV provides lots of cognitive programs like cooking , taking care of pets , how to eat as well .
For me , I do prefer reality shows that help people how to deal with problems .
football is the most favourite sport in the World .
Was founded by talented athlete in The UK in early 1900.The Sport was becoming very famous since first World Cup was held in Uruguay until the present .
I really enjoy watching and playing football since I was a kid .
There are several reasons of why people really enjoyed soccer so mush .
Nothing is permanent in this world , I 've knew these words from the mouth of my parents and until now it is in my heart that help me to deal with this kind of life .
Sometimes your happy and sometimes you are sad , nor you are success or you are failed , that is the wheel of the life we are taking .
Life is changing very fast as the days on the calendar is going , the flow of life continuously revolving with the world every person have .
Nobody can tell how , when , where and what will happen in the next 50 years of our life .
It depends on how you deal with what you have at the present to be prepared for the forthcoming changes in the future .
There are a lot of factors that could greatly affect on what you will be in the coming 50 years of your life .
But the most vital part for these changes is yourself .
Everybody has the right one for a change but it should be for the betterment and not for the worse .
With the simultaneous growing inventions of technologies , way of living go through with it .
A complicated ways from before , advance technologies made it easy and simple now , what else more could we expect next .
The digital age has been a big problem for musical industry because the news technologies and internet had helped more the musical piracy .
The people already do not buy a CD , simply downloads it
" Piracy is destroying the music industry " as it is a violation of copyright .
It is a shame that a person is working during many moths for after the people want enjoying his work without having to pay , it is literally to steal .
It is like you design a chair and the people to take without paying .
The singers have to adapt and be able to survive piracy , now most their income are the concerts and digital platform like Spotify .
I think that people should be more responsible and respect the work of others so that society evolves in a healthy way and without conflicts .
Today , many people , groups or social movements are disagree with different and mainly aspects of our dominant culture ; for example , the marriage or the age for married , the role of women in the family , the religions , the education and new ways of family and many values .
This perspective of life is inspired by contracultural movements and some people call to these people as " alternative " , but it is each day more common and it let a inclusive and diverse society .
The culture is changing in this way , maybe it can be wonderful for the human freedom .
CHANGES IN COLOMBIAN CULTURE
Eating habit in my country really has changeged in the last ten years .
it 's r is n't clear complety , but I sopuse it depends on chenging habit of life in developing process of our sosiety .
At first and important change is about eating prepared food that is n't healthy usually , its reason probably woman 's life stile that is going to big change in the way that they do n't like staying at home and spend their time to making food , now they prefer to buy prepared good .
The other matter is about our habit to eating food together with our family that were a custom in humanity life not just in our culture , but now because of hard and busy life , we had to eat our meal mostly days of a week .
Now , we forget big dinner table that are fulled with family members .
But a good change of our habit is attention to calery food and healthy food because of get information on internet and another media that are accessible way for all people easily these days .
Tottaly l think changing is ignorable but we can control it to make our life better , specially about food that is most important aspect of ourlife but we do n't pay attention to it enough .
I am a programmer who wants to write about programming languages and skills .
The truth of matter is I think I 'm full of ideas but unfortunately I ca n't describe my knowledge and experiences in English .
However I can write these ideas in my own native language and that 's why I 'm thinking that one day I should be able to write those ideas in English as well .
Dear Sophie , I have just come back from a really exciting few days with my cousin .
That was the best place I had ever been .
we went to New York for four days .
On Thursday , we arrived at 12.15 .
While I was at the bathroom , me cousin was smoking .
When I went back , a policeman asked him not to smoke , so he was angry during the whole flight .
On Friday , we went on an incredible sightseeing but the guide told me not to take pictures because I had to buy them .
On Saturday night , we went to a formal restaurant to eat pasta .
Finally , we departed at 18.45 pm .
I think I will go back next year .
It was a well planned for a holiday .
Michael , together with his two friends , Adam and John decided take a vacation at Pulau Langkawi , Kedah , Malaysia .
They search for tickets flight , rental car , and hotel .
They were too excited and can not wait to go there .
About one month before departure , they search over the internet the places that might get interested in their mind .
There are Padang Matsirat , Cable Car , Mahsuri Tomb , small islands , Duck tour , beaches , shopping centre and the most exciting is to buy chocolates .
One day before going , Michael suddenly having a problem .
He needs to follow his family to the town .
With all his hurt heart , he told his two friends about the matter .
Adam and John was very angry .
They said , they already planned and Michael happily ruined the vacation .
They need to think again about the budget and all of the stuff .
Michael can not stand anymore , he scolded his friends and saying something that anyone do not want to hear .
His mother heard what had happened .
She try to have a slow talk with her son at his room .
She said , money can make everyone hurt if it is not settle down very well .
After all the wise advises , his mother kissed him on his forehead .
Michael try to think again wisely .
He accompany his mother at the end of his room 's door .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
He called back his friends and manage to settle down all the mess up .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately but he forget what he had to do after thinkig he rememebred that he had to visit his grandmother as she was ill and his mother told him that his grandmother wanted to see her doctor and wanted him to take her by his car as adoctor 's clinic far from her house peter decided to go and he drove his car to his grandmother 's house in the next street after he arrived , he saw his grandmother was waiting for him on the front of the street he apologized to her and asked her to come to the car , " never mind " she told and ride the car beside him .
Peter drove his car to the doctor 's clinic and after half an hour he arrived and he and his grandmother go above through the stairs to reach the doctor 's clinic after they arrived they found that they have to stay aperiod of time to take his turn they waited and then their turn came .they entered the doctor and the doctor was very kind he welcomed them and after check peter 's grandmother .
she was very fine
There is a man who is most important for one 's life .
I am not different from that.there is a back stairs influence in my life he is none but my father .
I respect him so much and admire also .
He is my best friend who never hurts me .
He always helps me by giving good advance .
He is an ideal farmer who never and even tells a lie .
His means of livelihood is the simplest .
He always honors the oldest and taught us of avoiding tells a lie.so far as I remember one day he was advising me suddenly a old man entered the conversation and told a foolish speech .
Nevertheless my father did n't tell him arrogantly but he made him know the right thing politely .
he is a fluent speaker .
that 's why I admire him .
Everyone make mistakes , No one say I have not made any mistake in my life .
I have made many mistake I guess .
But is that big problem in our life or small problem or it really does not matter ?
Or do you really regretted what have you done ?
Travelling by car plays an important role in our life .
There are a lot of private transport in the streets .
However travelling by bus or tram never get away from our daily routine . Travelling by bus is not such convenient as getting a car , but you would never know what can happen with your car , where it will stuck or some of other accedient will happen .
Public transport has a timetable .
This fact gives government such opportunity as manage the traffic on the roads , cities or towns streets .
Private transport give us traffic jams , a lot of accidents and stressful situations .
We are getting nervous because we are responsible not only for our life but other people , too .
And also we have to understand that use public transport is cheaper than use a car .
The other side of the problem is ecology .
Why do we think that only convenience can be the main point of using a car ?
What can we say about our ecological consciousness ?
Let 's take a bicycle travelling to our school or job instead of using any public or private transport .
Transport is more important for our life .
Public transport is becoming no future because of travelling by car is more convenient .
Public transport are not suitable for luggage 's .
Travell plan need to depend on public transport time .
It is more fun when we travelling by car .
We can play music or talk anything while we travel in the car
Public transport is more boring .
If there is no Public transport in some area , then we need to hire taxi .
So If we have our car , it is much easier than using transport .
Dear Jo ,
How are you ?
Nice to receive your letter and learn that you will be in Hong Kong this summer .
Hong Kong is wonderful place for shopping , eating and sight - seeing country .
You can taste sea - food in Sai Kung and Abeedeen .
Visiting Big Budda in Lamma Island , watch the beautiful night view in the Peak .
Besides , Hong Kong also has many country parks for hikking .
I am sure that you will love this country !
If you want to find a job for only three months , I suggest you can teach English for summer lesson .
In Hong Kong , most of student would like to take some courses in Summer Holiday .
I will get some information for you if you have interest it .
Write to me if you have fixed your itinerary and looking forward to see you in Hong Kong .
Ta
I think public transport is paramount nowadays , but the future will deliver us some kind of different means of transport , such as the car , yes , a car we have been using all our lives .
But this time will be another story because in order to save time and money we are going to use our own car .
Let me explain my reasons , when you drive your car you can take it from your garage or in the main door of your house and it gets you whatever you want , but on the other hand if you take public transport it will be much more uncomfortable because you must catch the bus in the bus stop ... where is your nearest bus stop ?
Then you must pick the subway to your destination , so that means a waste of time , otherwise is cheaper , but what happens if you do n't have some coins to pay the bus driver ? here comes the problem .
You should look for a shop to exchange your money into coins .
What 's the time , then ?
Obviously you are late to work , even if you have an appointment to make an interview for a job .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
She read a note from her boyfriend Tom .
She must go to a shopping centre because Tom is waiting for her in the shopping centre .
They go to a new film about James Bond .
Alison is very happy because she did not see Tom for two months .
he must study in a different country and they not see each other for months .
Tom is sutding in London .
Alison go to a bus stop and she waiting for a bus .
She can not wait to see Tom .
When she arrived at a shopping centre Tom is already waiting .
They want to spend all evening together .
The lion king is my favourite film .
It is the story about a little lion and his life .
Symba is the main character .
He must began to be the king .
He lives on the wild .
His father saves him of a fight but he died and Symba is sad .
He moves to another place because he did n't want to be on the same place where his father died .
But he knows Timon and Pumba and they get that Symba believe again that life is good .
Then , Symba save to Pumba of a lion and this lion is Nala who is an old friend of Symba .
They return and Symba gets to be the lion king .
I would recommend this film because it is funny , entertaining and you can learn principles .
My name is shousheng and live in Montreal Canada .
Alrough Canada is an English country however in Montreal , the offical language is Freach .
So I do not have opptunity to practical English Because most of my colleagues speak French .
They speak French in the meeting , in the gearm , and in the shopping
My favourite sport is running .
When I have a free time I usually run because I feel really relaxed after that .
I started this sport six years ago and I found myself .
When I stop doing it for a week , I feel that there is something missing and I 'm not in a good shape .
I advise everyone to start this sport .
In the fact , I know it 's very difficult to do it if you give it up .
But it 's very important for your health .
Running will help you burn calories and make you calm and relaxed .
My favourite sport is football .
I like football because it improves my basic skills and my mind does not take that much stress .
Football is really good because it is an active sport .
It is bewildering !
I was inspired by a true ledgend , his name is Edan Hazard .
He plays for Chelsea .
My favourite teams are Chelsea , Man city , Man united , Real madrid and barcelona .
That all I can say . I love football very much
yes we can say that for car is much convenient . but every person could not be afford car .
even that price behind fuel for car .
that 's first fact .
and the second one is that fashion or style of young people who do n't like more go somewhere using a car than bike .
after that last point we can not go everywhere using a car we would like .
that have limitation also there .
might be somany people are liking because there are so many service with it .
but it does not means that public transport is not having future .
that fact behind sense because maintainance of public transport is not responsiblity of traveler .
if we want to count function of public transport because it 's not enough words to say . but public transport is most need service in big city as well as small villeges .
It 's not so hard to find sights to see in such a big city like Moscow , but when you have a wide variety of museums , parks , clubs , you will try to visit only best ones .
Let 's look at the most popular places where tourists prefer spending their free time in Moscow .
I 'm sure i 'll agree that the Red Square is the most popular sight in captial of Russia .
That 's why I suggest starting the journey from this place .
You can get there by metro ( Teatralnaya Station ) .
From the Red Square you can easily see Moscow Kremlin , St. Basils Cathedral , the State Historical Museum and Gum Trading House .
If you are dying of hunger you can have a quick snack at Teremok cafe or have a square meal at the restaurant # 57 , which on the the third floor of the Gum .
I prefer spending my free time in the parks .
Gorky Park is my favorite place for my leisure .
It 's a capital 's central park where you 'll wind lots of interesting affairs .
There are lots of facilities such as sports centre , ping pong club , hire centre etc .
There is an open - air cinema , but it opens only after 10.00 PM .
So , if you want to have a memorable holiday , the capital of Russia is the most attractive place .
My friend 's name is Kadir .
He is from Giresun .
He likes playing mobile phone , playing basketball and reading a book .
He is hobbies listen to music , play computer game , watch the football match and watch TV .
These are my friends hobbies .
I 'd like to talk about my past .
I 'm only fifteen years old but I think I have a heavy past ..
First , I 've always lived in a kind of little flat which is a social logement .
We did n't have a lot of money but I went to a private elementary school .
There were a lot of rich people , maybe we were about ten to one hundred not living in a house .
I had a lot of friends , too much friends ..
At sixth grade , I realized that they did n't really love me , or even like me .
I remember two contrats moments : One day we had to create a team to make an exercise which used brain , they chose me .
Although , another time , we had to create a team for doing sport , and they did n't choose me .
That get to the second problem I had , and stay now : my weight .
They did n't choose me because of my weight .
I was too fat , too much fat .. I looked at my health booklet one month ago , and I saw that I have been overweight since I 'm four years old .
Until sixth grade , I thought I was " normal " , but then all changed ..
Learning English is very important by the future of all .
Is a language that many people speak and known .
Many people start learning English at school .
Later , the people continue in language schools .
Is a difficult language , so , the best option is to go abroad .
In an English speaking country , everyday you learn to live .
People speaking different but with a basic level understand English .
It is difficult to go to a place unknown with different people but is a good experience to learn .
I think if the whole world has only one language would be better .
Everyone could speak and understand .
Not so , therefore , we must study very English .
Because of her suggestions , I learned how to control my temper while I was facing with failures and kept telling myself that was n't a big shame because I had had tried my best .
Thus , I became more mature because I overcame those hard times .
I like walking in the morning every day and I enjoy doing it with my own or with my friends , and because it 's very useful for my health and also it keeps my body healthy and full of energy .
sometimes I feel tired of walking especially in the sunny days with a high temperatures , but that ca n't let me stop doing this sport .
when I 'm walking , that can refresh me all the time and makes me feeling good .
I want to give advice to people who love thing type of sport ; please do not let it go , and do it as you can , because it 's a benefit sport .
Hi , everyone .
its good idea to improve my English writing .
I 'd like to speak the education process in Egypt .
I have just graduated from faculty of law " English division " from two years ago , with very good grade .
The ordinary result of the big effort I had exerted in my university to have good job in my specialization like a lawyer .
But in Egypt no one takes his right you should pay a lot of money to have a job or knowing someone use his authority to appoint you .
So , I intended to get a job in another state like Dubai , I heard jobs there is very good and also the compensation . I have submit my CV in various jobs .
but what is the common reply ?
your qualifications are not satisfied , You must be UK Or USA educated .
Finally , I see that I have very high marks in education but not have the ability to work in the real life because in Egypt there is the worst education .
Thanks .
1 ) I like helping people
2 ) Tom offered to go to the cinema .
3 ) Meryy refused borrowing money .
4 ) Can we afford to purchase a car next year ?
5 ) I look forward to meet you .
6 ) The movie I watched made me cry .
I do not think , it 's easy to do research in India .
Even if once a time , I want to focus on my work they will create one or the other issue to distract me .
I will make my own path , though it will be difficult for me .
But it will be very romantic to be with my girlfriend and fight with the system .
We generally use the word " stress " when we feel that everything seems to have become too much - we are overloaded and wonder whether we really can cope with the pressures placed upon us .
We can change everything hurt us if we need if we have volition
The reasons for stress are more diverse perhaps because we have an exam period , family proplems or because we think in negative way , or we destroyed ourselves in long hours of working and canceld our needs for enough comfortable , and lots of reasons to stress ...
We must get out of the stress quickly before lose ourself because it 's very hurtful period , for example you can read a book , doing sport , play music , eating delicious food , remmeber all the positive thing was took place with you , talk about someone who trust for him , take off every thing make you upset and make you life tiring , go out and eat meal with your best joking friends , and there a lot of you have to do ...
Remmeber the stress is not lasting thing , and you can avoid it
But if you are willing to live in happy life .
Dear Sir
I am writing to complain about the cafe - Lunch menu .
In my opinion the main course needs a lack of improvement .
Firstly , I am a vegetarian and I do n't have much choice of vegetables .
Secondly there are not much variety of dessert mainly fruits and puddings .
There is not much variety of healthy drinks , there not much hot drinks as well .
Some people say that in my college are vegetarian , Muslim , vegan e.c.t and they do not have much variety of food to choose like halal meat and veg and nothing that comes from animals .
It is considered that you change the type of food regularly .
Reduce the fast food that make people obese and not healthy .
It will be better if you gave drinks compared to the weather like whenever its winter we would like a hot drink and if it is summer we would like a chilled drink .
I hope you consider this major problem in the cafe .
Thank you .
Yours faithfully
Dear Mrs Ashby ,
I 'm writing to you regarding of a letter I 've seen on my way home calling for candidates to fill a vacancy in your cafe staff .
As requested , I 'm an English - speaking guy and currently looking for a job that does n't disrupt my studies at college .
For that reason , this job is perfectly suitable for me and , besides , it showed up as a good opportunity for me to improve my incoming helping me paying my bills .
Now I am twenty fiver years old and when I was teenager I lived abroad twice .
The first time in London , for 6 months , and most recently in Berlin , for 8 months .
the movie I 'm going to be reviewing is " the purge "
I actually loved it quite a lot , I just loved all the suspense and the parts they leave you hanging , it 's just way too interesting , the movie is about the american government who annually gives 12 hours where all crime , even murder , is legal , and there are no medical services during that long period of what they call " the purge " and anyone can join it , you can kill whoever you want .
The thing is , some people do n't think it 's ok , and they do n't agree , so they just stay inside and try to survive the night .
The diagrams illustrates the process about producing bank notes .
At the first beginning , bank notes should be well - designed considering the colour matching and artwork including the issues about safety .
After designing , metal plates are supposed to be prepared with the help of experienced machinists .
Then , it comes to the printing step .
Ensuring there is colour on both sides , image is increased gently by a certain type of ink .
Most importantly , before distribution , printed sheets with 50 bank notes per sheet have to be checked whether they are of perfect quality or not .
They can only be packed and distributed when they are with good quality .
In other words , both bad sheets and the ones which are seperated badly need destroying in a safe way which can stop them from going into the market .
That 's how bank notes are produced from paper to the one we can purchase goods in our daily life .
Many people believe that nowdays there is no future in public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient , but others continue with the tought that they do help for example for travelling for long distance .
I believe both are useful .
Firstly , there is plenty of people who ca nt buy a car and so the only option they have is to travel by these transports .
The ticket does nt cost to mutch and it is avaible for the majority of the people at least comparing to buying a car .
Secondly , public transports are more eficent to travel for long distance than cars and people would nt have to purchase combustible .
When people are avaible to tavel to other continents or far away , they may need a plane , wicth is a public transport , to complete the journey because the have tu cross oceans and clomplicated distances that have different landforms .
However , a car is something witch is from the person and he can do wathever he wants and find it in the same way he or she left it , and sometimes public sports are nt left in the best way .
In addiion , you have to share with people you absolutely do nt know and probably wo nt see again .
Consequesntly yo can be stole or get sick .
But , by obseving all these people you can rich yourself with different cultures and manners the other have and incorporate new topics .
To conclude we can establish a middle point .
Public sports are useful but sometimes inconvenient but more cheaper . You can get to know new people and different cultures .
When I was 12 , I went in France for the first time in my life .
That was my first time on holiday in another country that was n't nourth Italy .
I remember i woke up at 6 o'clock for took the train and went to Paris in France .
After 4 hours sat on an uncomfortable seat , we arrived at the train station and then my parents and me went to the hotel .
We fisited a lot of monuments , museums and churces , like the Louvre with the Monalisa by Leonardo Da Vinci .
That week I felt happy and relaxed but I was a little bit sad when we returned in Italy .
I am waiting only to go there another time !
Nowadays my people have their own transport , for example they have cars .
Transport is the best situation for people to can travel around a country .
Without transport people can not go back to work and do something else .
With public transport , is the best way to go to work . Because it is easy to travel .
No need to pay a full amount because they have many people who entered the bus .
Public transport helped us to know our country and improve ours body to move one place to another .
For example , we should walk to go in a place whereas a car can park in the place which we want to go .
It helps us in many difficult ways , if they have a problem we can take a bus and go there .
It will be more appropriate for us .
All village they have a bus - stop where the bus stop to take or leave passengers .
And some bus drive at night to take passengers .
Without it many people will have many difficult to go somewhere or to return home .
However , they have some disadvantages with a public transport , they gave many traffic jam , this is because the bus a large and difficult to control .
If the roads are small , the bus would go in the street .
The bus would not leave the passengers where they want to go , because they have to leave them in the bus - stop .
Day by day the country develop more and more , nowadays they have trains .
Many people travel by train because they arrive more faster than the bus and cheaper in a long run .
The public transport will have many future because some people have no money to buy their own car .
Public transport have help us in many different ways .
It will better if they have public transport .
Dear Kuba !
Do your family is happy that you come back ?
Are you fine ?

She went with me and we talk about everything !
She is very interesting and wise person , but the best is her humor .
We are going to travel to the France in this holiday .
It is fantastic ! I ca n't wait .

Nowadys using public transport is considered to be the most convenient
way to move around .
It provides citizen the freedom to relax and disconnect while going home or to work .
However , taking your own car is the much more useful .
And for this reason I honestly think it will be the only means of transport in the future .
You also asked about the leisure activities in Spain .
Well , let me tell that there are lots of ways to have a good time there .
For me , the most interesting one is sightseeing around the city and discover its monuments and landmarks .
However , there are also an endless of leisure activities such as going shopping or going to museums , to cinemas or to beautiful parks
If it were not enough , you will be able to enjoy the amazing atmosphere of our nightlife , going to restaurants , to clubs or lounge bars .
In my town people are very educated and very aware of the environment , they know very well that if we take care of the environment then it will useful for us only , so they always take care about the rubbishes and try to clean the village .
Whenever they are going to outside always keeping the plastic bag with them so whatever rubbish thing they will not thrown to the road or outside .
they always keep the rubbish and dust to plastic bag and then they throw to dust bin
D. Perhaps , bilingual school creation might be a good idea of Colombian education improvement , but it will be appropriate to be aware that Colombia actually has public schools with a basic education where English is considered as another academic subject , in contrast with the private ones .
Because a majority of do n't have enough resources to pay for it .
The whole picture conveys us the process of making bank notes .
It depends five main steps which include desigh , preparation of metal plates , printing , inspection , packaging and distraction or disposal depends on whether the fourth step is good or bad .
Above all , the design is the most previous way we should know , which is considered with the background color and artwork .
Secondly , we need preparation of metal plates that subsidiarize with skilled machinsts .
And the we need printing and inspection .
Eventually , the most essential part comes out , we need significate the quality of the sheets .
If it 's good , packing and distributin whereas the others shoulde be distroyed as well .
In conclusin , the whole part of process is an unreversed schedule .
It cosumemed the power which contained the humanity and machinic .
Nevertheless , in my opinion the most precious of the revolution is the modern security measure through such a muti - developed society .
To begin with is design , we are able to considerate backgroud colour , artwork , and security issues , and then , we are supposed to preparing mental plates , such as skilled and machinists .
Secondly , printing -- including sheetsof bank notes , printed(50 bank notes per sheet).There are some requestion -- colour on both sides , special ink , images slightly raised .
The most important step is inspection that the printed sheets should manually inspected .
If partially damaged sheets exist , the bank notes should separated into good and bad .
In the end , if it is a good sheet , the porcedure is packaging and distribution , including cutting into separate bank notes , packing , dispatching .
If it is a bad sheet , the porcedure is disposal --bad sheetsand bank notes should be securely destroyed .
I do not know from where I can start .
Back in the 40 's , Cairo was considered as one of the cleanest and the friendly environmental city around the world , Even cleanest than Paris or other cities in Europe .
But the time is changes and things are changing with it .
Nowadays , Cairo can be considered as one of - if not the most - the dirtiest city in the world .
Rubbish is everywhere , people finish their food and throw empty bags in the streets instead of holding it until they found a trash .
So , the ugly truth is my country is n't clean and people do nothing towards this .
In this picture there is a man behind a counter in a shop .
There are lots of guns on the wall .
In the right corner there 's a sign which says that in this shop it 's not to been allowed to sell knives .
It is a fact that on the one hand you have the opportunity to buy dangerous weapons nowadays but on the other hand we are unable to manage this situation correctly .
It is true that there are an increase on violence in the past and it is our duty to tell our children that a world without guns are a better world .
It was late Summer in Africa .

Dear teacher :
I am your new student , Zhen Xuan Wang .
I come from Taoyuan Bade .
I like riding my bicycle in the streets .
I am studying in Yung Feng high school .
Not long ago , I won first prize in math competitions in school .
Presidential election will begin in Taiwan next year .
I look forward to result released .
All the time , we are learning more for our various wishes .
My goal is an admission of National University .
Best regards ,
your student , Zhen Xuan Wang .
continue the study
Any one in the world has future Goal .
My ultimate aim is to continue my study .
unfourtunitly my previous study was in Arabic .
this matter prevent me from achieving my Goal .
the most diffucalt area in English I suffer from is the writing .
I have no issue in reading speaking or lesining .
As part of my plan to improve the English skils , I decieed to search on the internet for any free program which can help me for the improvement plan in the English writing .
I found your web site and this my first try .
.

Trieste is a little town situated in the nord - east of Italy .
We have diversified harvest like in the rest of the world , not only in the houses but also in every public building .
For example in our school there is the possibility to collect paper and plastic in different boxes .
In the last year some political men have decided to put in order our city , so for example they put again to place the roads .
In the middle of the principal street , that is next to the sea , there is a divider with a lot of flowers and plants .
So the ambiental impact is very attractive .
We have still many problems to solve in our city .
There are n't boxes for rubbish in every condominium , and we haven't the harvest of the dampness that is present in many other towns of Italy .
Another problem is that the citizen of Trieste do n't pay attention at the ambiental problems of their city .
For example , when a man or a woman has ended to smoke he / she throws the earth cigarette not in the right box .
In other countries it would be impossible , because if someone wanted to do this , he 'll receive a bill to pay .
I think it would be important that , not only in the family , but also in the school could be grow a new generaion sensible to ecological problems of the earth .
In this way we can have the possibility to change .
Hi .
Today a lot of people do sports , but all sports are not amused .
It 's great for me write about the sport and health .
When I was child I ususally play with my friends of football .
I sometimes played at break of school in the morning .

The public pool is near my house .
On the one hand This sport is good for my health I stay fit .
On the other hand I have met a lot of people , they are very friendly .
And finally only I tell you that you should do some sport It is good for us life .

Off the top of his head he had asked his nephew to go to the fishing together .
Jerry said that he would be privileged .
It emerged that that young boy have a good head for fishing and now they are always go to the fisihng together .
I do n't have a favorite sport .
I practise a lot of sports , and now I 'm going to tell all over them .
I like running , ride my bike , playng football , skiing at winter , climbing , etc .
What I like to run is to go the mountain and enjoy the landscape .
What I like to go bike is doing routes and very long paths .
I like football because it is a sport that I practiced from small and I think that is the team sport more fun and exciting .
I like skiing because it is a sport that I also did from small I like large speeds and lower living at high altitudes and enjoying great landscapes .
I like to climb but it is a sport that I just started ... but I want to keep practising it and keep learning new things .
The issue of taking care of the environment is very topical in the modern world .
Amount of garbage is encreasing at the same time with encreasing amount of humans .
The growth of consumption in developing countries leads to encreasing consumption more energy , water and other sources .
Pollution of the ecosystems is groving to in these countries as a result .
This problems are topical in our city Kyiv to .
Nowadays our local governmet is making some desisions for improving the situation .
It is going to build several modern combustion plants , some programmes for discrete rubbish collection are implementnig .
There are a lot of citizens movement except oficial activities .
People orginise common action for cleaning nearhouse territories .
Some activists plant out trees in spring .
These activities especially have a place in spring and in outumn .
I hope that most of the big enterprises , plants and stations will be taken out of the city border .
this days the transportation become so crawdad .we have a lot of cars in the streets .
there are a lot of accidents because many people driving so fast .
we should put many cameras in the street to know how is caused of this accidents .
if every body know that there are a punishment for what they do and no body can escape from what he did I guess we will have a few of transportations accident .

Nowadays , people are getting more independent , and more than this problem , society now needs to show the other this independence and control of their own lives , which includes cars , houses and materials .
On the one hand , travelling by car can be an excellent way to move yourself for where you want to go , without going on foot to find your bus station and becomes less important if you live in the centre of your town or in the suburbs .
Another advantage of travelling by car is that you do n't have to spend time waiting for your other transport , as also as you can avoid the confusion of people that are in the subway stations every morning to get in the line you want to arrive at work in time .
On the other hand , public transport are the only resource some people have to move on , and more than excellent to the environment , it 's also a good way to avoid traffic and spend money on petrol , once it 's cheaper if you catch a bus .
Another disadvantage is that using the car can be useless in some situation , like if you go to a football game by car , you probably wo n't have a place to park it .
In conclusion , cars wo n't let public transports be forgot , once more than providing the only way some people have to travel , cars are n't so convenient for some situations .
I think you must go to a large school in the town because here you can have more friends and you can do a lot of other things that you can do in the countryside .
I really want to go to a big school in the town because here in the countryside I can go out with my friends or go shopping with them .
I the town you can do everything fun .
You can go to the shopping , to the halfpipes , to the skateparks and you can do a lot of other cool things with your friends but in the countryside no .
But you must go to the school that you want , this is just my advice ok ?
I really want that you be happy with your new life .
A big kiss and a big hug
Anna
I think that the family and friends are the most important in our lives because if you have some problems they are always here and they try to help you .
These people can influence in our life for example , if you have a bad friends you become a bad person and you will have probles in your live.so , your education depends on the people around you .
It is not important if these people are friends or family , they can change our lives for better or worst , depend on you choose the best thing that it can help you .
As we know , in our days everything is possible .
We have so many advantages that make our lives easier .
Even the way of studying has changed .
In general , people have the possobility to study in libraries or using the computers .
Studying in libraries asks a lot of quiet and patience .
There you must n't speak lauder and you always have to wait for your turn to borrow something or you have to wait if another student has the book you need .
Personally , I think studying on a computer it 's a better chooise .
I 'm not saying that just because of the easy way by you can study what you want .
Studying using a computer offers you the possibility to be more relaxed when you do it .
In this way , you can maybe read aloud .
If I were a student that usually studies in a library I would definitely try to study on a computer .
In this way I would n't waste a lot of time .
If somebody says that there is no future for public transport i mind immediately . today there are too many vehicles in our streets .
the roads are chock a block.everybody has a private car .
people is thinking about comfortable life instead of environment and cost saving .
Hi , Shannon :
About my town in the future .
It will be very different .
Meanly , the change in the environment .
Also , every year , there are more companies that produce different types of pollution in our planet .
For this , I think that the climate will change in 20 years .
Therefore , the animals do not survive with this climate .
Also , the humans ca n't go to the Street all day , only a few hours for the hot climate .
The live there will be harmful for everybody !
We need to do something to sabe the world !
What do you think about this ?
Take care ,
Conchi .
The members of my Family are certain my real best friends , whose i can trust and ask everything without shameless or regrets .
I think they are our first friends and our first confidents .
All days they prove they are the persons whose care about me .
Thionk about family 's routine .
Every morning they take breakfast together , speaking about things not too important .
They listen to you , discuss our problems .
Sorry for taking too long to get back to you , it 's the end of the quarter and you know how crazy is this period for a sales man .
Yes , you can share my contacts .
I would like to understand the benefits of an MBA at IMD and how it would help me on my career .
Talking about the world cup a little .
Watching to our national teams games , I got the conclusion that we have no need to check our heart condition .
Brazil and Nederlands games were a real test for our health .
What do you think ?
I appreciate your support .
Kind Regards .
According to the reality a lot of young people are n't very communicated in their life .
They think their life is so boring and also very mad .
But I think different .
For example in your childhood you are much more happiest than your Parents because their job is not very easy .
They have to look after their children and it 's very stressed I think .
Most teenagers ca n't understand that , and they think that the job of their parents is not difficult .
Firstly , young people usually calm down trough the music for example classic music .
But most of young society are not interested this type of music .
for instance they prefer Pop or also rock music .
Through you listen the music you can expressed your emotions and this is the most beautiful thing .
Secondly , they like watching series in a TV .
That make their happy and additionally make loud .
Usually the watch criminal series because it 's very interesting and really mysterious .
Teenagers have different styles .
A lot of young mans love wearing jeans and t - shirt .
Because it 's very comfortable .
But girls love wearing skirt and snug shirt .
I think the style is very important in our life .
Across style we can express our emotions and feelings .
In conclusion life of young people is not very easy .
We have a lot of unhappy days and we have a lot of problems too .
hi my name is Adrian i am 17 years old and i am footballer . I was born too be a footballer .
We were playing everyday football in the school and I was the best .
I was even better than the older children everyone was telling me too go to a team .
but i dident had too do anything , a team took when i was 11 years old .
The name of the team was Katsa .
i was at this team for 5 years and the made me even better in football .
I played my first match at 16 years old and i felled very special because i was 16 and i was capable of putting 3 goals .
I played so good that everyone gave me congratulations but that s not all one of the best team of the world wanted too take me .
I was very happy and of course i agreed .
For my opinion , I 'm definitely agree with that .
Already , for only 20 years a lot of thing because of the technology .
And I think that iy 's not a technology will change but the people and their caracteres themselves .
Unfortunaly , for this generation there wo n't be a real relationship , all relation will become a virtual relationship .
The good news is the average of people who can take advantage of the technology can economise a lot of time because they might have a sophisticate robot can help at home .
According my experience , if we do n't exagerate the way we use technologie like internet , phone , satellite .
It will be the good thing that we can spend our time for a good thing
In some people 's lives the most important is to wear fashionable clothes .
On the one hand , I think it is important tolook good , but sometimes the latest fashion is not the best choiceto feel happy and comfortable .
For example , now the high - heeld shoes is very trendy but it costs a lot and the most woman does n't look good in it .
On the other hand , the personality is more important and determinative than an expensive dress , it is a fact .
Butif somebody wants to follow the latest fashion , I accept it , because she just in those clothes feels good .
In conclusion , my opinion is that the personality is more important than the clothes we wear , but everybody has his own life and a choice to decide what she wants .
Transportation is one of the most essential part of our day to day life ; whether it is puplic or private , transport takes the same priority in each one 's life from the very early days .
Basically , we 've land , water and air transport for reliable purpose .
In the age before the industrialisation came in to exsitance , people were also using various alternatives to travel from one place to another .
They mostly depend on animal to make cart to ride on them .
Then the technology improved gradually towards mechanical engines to make the transport more convinient .
The developed version of all those engines are use in the running vehicles of land , water and air which make our life more faster .
But in this modern era of globalisation , global warming is one of the prime concern of the earth .
And when we look at the modern technologies of transportation , it glances no future for public transport .
It is inevitably true that , excessive use of public transport leads to higher level of pollution .
So , it would better to go for any other alternative of green technology for future purpose to make this world a better place .
Yesterday , I had a wonderful day .In the morning I went to a Galician basketball training with a coach of Spanish selection , when finished went to my parents to a hotel to eat and stay with some friends , after the food meet with friend 's of my parents and went to a theme park and we rode to a rollers coaster , it was very exciting and we ate a chocolate ice cream , it was delicious .At night we went to a match of Spanish basketball league , Obradoiro versus Real Madrid and that match won the team of Real Madrid and then I went home to sleep .
This is my wonderful day .
when I find me in London , I 'm going to the buckingham palace located in the city of westminster and I 'll see your art gallery and tourist attraction of the British monarchy
continue in London , I will visit to the largest parks in London , the hyde park that having a full day of guided outdoor games and activities for perservation thereof park
follow in London I 'll go for a walk to arrive at the big ben that is the most beautiful bullding in all its splendour when I will take pictures
later , I 'll take the underground of London that is a public fast transit system , I 'm trawiling in it
when I 'll leave of the underground in the station wembley park I going to the wembley stadium where I will enjoy an evening of football , the match started at 8:00pm
My favorite band is " cbjr " , its a brazillian band , the type of music is rock and rap , yours music are very easy to single .
I really like , in the moments when I am listernning turn up the radio , but the singles are died .
Generally speaking , it has been suggested that mixed - sex education will improve to the degree of learning system at schools .
In another way of saying , this kind of education system should be included in the whole classes in all schools .
However , I strongly believe that the measurement of education level does not explicitly interest with sex differences in the classes , but also it is related to the quality of education level in the schools .
Education has a crucial part in one society and it 's future and by improving the level of educations system , students can learn more effectively in their entire education life and their career but also their skills will be improved by this process .
Nowadays , unfortunately , students can not take enough education from their schools whereas in some poor countries .
Their systems are no longer that good enough and students will not make a good career for their future .
On the other hand , by building more effective learning system which will provided by local authority , students will encouraged them learn more efficient .
Lack of teaching way , poor audience of the class , quantity of learning materials , for instance , all of these matters should be enhanced until the good quality has been set up in the system .
Besides , by putting these kinds of procedures , students will also gain more respect towards career and their job .
Hopefully , they will reach not only earn more money in their entire life but also society will have more development shape in any other developed counties .
It is true that coeducation can motive the student while they work with other sex group students , we ought to also bear in mind , this is not only solution to get best result .
Therefore , we should consider other kinds of problems which affect on education system .
In a nutshell , based on the above - mentioned point such as , quality of educations system not only interests with mix - education but also it will need some good solutions in some subjects that mentioned .
It is personally concluded that this kinds of developments will be put into the action for all schools shortly .
I like my family and my friends .
For that , is a pleasure speak about them !
I am starting to introduce my favorite family members .
My sister is older than me two years .
She has an important person to me since my 8 years .
Our parents separated in 1980 , when I was 8 and when she was 10 .
Since this time , we stayed very linked until now .
We have a good relation , she is my main friend .
She knows all about me .
My father is other person important to me .
I appreciate his a lot , because he stayed with me and my sister and his life changed completely .
He invested in our education and today he has much admiration on our life and our decisions .
When I became , first teenager and after an adult , I knew the majority of my friends , a good friends .
We keep a regular contact , we go out to dinner or take a coffee many times .
More recently , I can not forgot my husband and my daughter .
Both are very important in my emotional stability .
In fact , I feel they are the most important people in my life !
Hello Stefan !
How are you ? Hope everything 's fine ,
all here is great .
It 's been so long since we last talk ... and I have some great news !
Well , I 'm writing to tell you that this summer I 'm going to the UK , and I 'd like to hang out with you some time !
It 'll be the second time I 'll visit the UK , and I would n't like to do the same excursions , so would you mind telling me some good activities to do or some places to visit there ?
Also , I 'd like to invite you to my house here in Spain , all my friends and I are having a party and it 'll be fantastic if you were able to come .
Hope to see you soon
Love ,
Rosa
Our world is very polluted by public transport so we think about what will happen in the future .Public transport causes many problems in our environment such as , difficult reaching to the nearest destination , the pollution , and causing diseases .
We must think alternative solutions for this problem .
We face difficulty in reaching in our own destination .
Many people who go to their work late .
Hence , if everyone has a private car he can go to his work on time .
Using the public transport makes us arrive late because it stops many times .
With our private car , we can do many tasks in our day , but using buses we waste our time , and more efforts .
Buses run with petrol that causes pollution .
Nowadays , there are some vehicles run with electricity.we can decrease pollution by using electricity .
Hence this will help people to be in a good health .
In addition , crowded buses cause affection among people .
private cars reduce the affection .
Crowded buses spread epidemic in our society .
Finally , we hope a healthy future for our new generations . We want to reach our destination on time and live in safe life without diseases and pollution .
my favourite sport is volleyball.i play it since 2006.my best position is number 2.i used to play it in faculty of engineering selection.it makes me fit and long .
i like it very much .
i used to play it with my frindes .
when i enter the egyptian armed forces , i played for the air defense forces team .
we won the 1st position , and got the cup of competition.if anyone attends to play this game , he should practice hard to be able to play it proffesionaly .
Further to the trade fair of the last week where we were a pleasure to meet you and we were talking about you courses .
I am looking for an organizational development course .
Could I have contact with any of your customer for more information ?
I am available to talk with you on Monday in the morning .
I am looking forward confirmation .
My favourite sport :
When I was a child , about four or five years old , my father teaches me what was football , and I loved it but , I really liked the goalkeepers , why I like football since childhood .
I think football shows you a lot of feelings and experiences .
I enjoy football because it is a form to forget problems and enjoy a bit , because when you are playing football , you are n't thinking other stuff , you only are concentrate at the game .
Football is a sport where anything can happen , no always win the best teams and is unpredictable , there is n't a dream team .
The football is a good form to do exercise because it is interesting and funny .
And if you do n't like do sport you can watch the matches of the teams around the world .
The most important invention is the mobile , because you can do whatever you want in only one communication device .
Today , it 's smaller , faster and cheaper than before .
Not only children have one , grandparents have either .
But with this gadget , we have a big problem : people are becoming isolated , we are living in our own world .
You can do a lot of things using your mobile , like : call someone , text , take pics , listen to music , watch movies , play games , wake you up ( alarm clock ) , access the internet , check your e - mails , pay your bills , access the social media , learn how to cook ... there are many more unthinkable things we can do .
But now , children want to have one as soon as possible , they do n't play hide and seek and play sports like before .
And one consequence of this is they have health problems .
Another problem is if your mobile is stolen , the thief can access all your personal life , he can check your e - mail , see your photos , etc .
And people are getting isolated , once I saw a mother using your mobile instead of taking care of her baby !
This is so sad !
In the future , it will probably we can almost everything using mobile , but we might pay attention in how this affects our life .
The pie charts illustrate the amount of household earnings allocation within regular families in two different years ( 2000 and 2010 )
overall , in both years , the amount of earnings allocation predominantly from Housing then followed by food / clothes .
There were a significant rise in the number of budget allocation from both categories ( Housing and food / clothes ) in 2000 and 2010 .
In contrast , Vacation / leisure and Misc were decrease over the same period of time .
Regarding the pie charts , there were significantly increased in the number of earnings allocation for Housing and Food / Clothes from about 35% and 25% in 2000 to about 50% and 35% in 2010 respectively .
However , the allocation of household budget for Misc , which was the least among other categories in 2010 ( around 15% ) , fell by 10% in 2010 from around 15% to approximately 5% respectively .
Furthermore , there was a slight decrease in Vacations / leisure allocation from 25% in 2000 to around 10% in 2010
Actually , the public transport show really no future .
The governments did n't had been giving good ideas to improve the public transport .
There are two good reasons for doing not use public transport in the future .
Firstly , the no continue the construction of more rail line of train to public transport is a one reason .
Secondly , people do n't like the old buses in the city centre .
Consequently , people prefer move in your own car .
On the other hand , I think there are two aspects that can change the actual situation .
The first is , The government can create a new plan os construction of trains .
The second aspect is , people can help to pay more tax to buy new buses .
As a result , we can have a public transport more comfortable .
In my opinion , the public transport can have future if all we collaborate us to improve .
Unless we do so , I believe no future for the public transport .
There are widely differing views on the issue of whether or not the benefits of study foreign language in earlier age outweigh the drawbacks .
Some people would suggest that learning new language before second school discourage their usual learning and that would struggle their understanding of other subjects .
However , I personally believe that the advantages is overweight .
The reasons for this as follows .
Learn how to walk before learn how to run , the opponents contend the children confuse the words and phrases with their mother tongue .
Confronting with challenges , primary students are struggled on the difference between first language and the learning one .
Thus , people view that children learn foreign language at primary school are worse than later .
Nonetheless , I would contend that learning foreign at primary school brings countless benefits to children .
Primary school , the best moment for learning , children are easier and faster to gain knowledge .
Not only less study burden when compare by secondary school , but they are able communicating with foreigners as well as extend their societal network during that period and the later life .
Rather than concern about the challenges , children would confront with , it is particularly advantaged for them to grasp foreign language during the elementary school .
By way of conclusion , I once again reaffirm my position that advantages of learning foreign language at primary school is much outweigh than the drawbacks .
Given that these children would have a better development in the future as well as more free time .
it is a story of a boy , who always find out the way to tease her sister sukh .
one day he got fight with her sister , even he made her cry.both of them stop talking to each other and after some day the boy need laptop of her sister sukh .
sukh was so angry with him because he heart her a lot , sukh refuse to give her laptop and her brother start again fighting with her and even he slapped her sister .
sukh start crying and she said she is not going to give you my laptop until you do n't feel sorry .
her brother pick her laptop and threw it and broke her laptop , then boy closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
In my opinion people 's lives will change dramatically in 50 years or so , because the world is changing all the time , and we have a lot of technology and things to do .
People change their way of thinking and try to do new things .
What is more , they do not the same things as their parents did .
To sum p I thonk it is enevitable .
The door of the room is closed .
Number 's room was 666 .
He knew that she was inside , waiting for the last conversation in relation with the life of Rose .
He pushed the door and come in .
She was sitting on the chair .
When she saw him , she smiled .
Then she started talking : " Welcome pretty boy , I am waiting for you , please sit down " .
He took a chair , staring her with rage . "
As you well know , rose 's life is your hands " she said and keep talking:" ... You are the only one , that can save her life , but before you must comply with your promise"."I Know it " he replied with a sad tone .
Then she took the document and stared reading in aloud voice : " With this agreement your soul is mine " .
Micheal did not know what think .
He loved rose with his entire soul , a soul that is losting .
Suddely , he took the agreement and signed with his blood the paper .
I do not care he thought , maybe I lost my soul but now she is alive .
After that , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
on the last vacation I went to France , to Paris with my colleague Sebastian for 2 weeks .
On the first day in France , we bought a French croissant for breakfast .
Then we went to the stadium Parc des Princes where we could not reach ,
and due to lack of knowledge of the language , nobody wo nt tell us which way to walk to the stadium .
By accident we ran into a good fairy who , with the young learned to all language in the world and thus led our stadium .
We made friends with this fairy after one entire day walking with her feel like you we knew each other a lifetime .
After the first week in France found that in Paris there is a large crowd .
For this reason , we left with a new friend to Marseilles , where there was less traffic .
We chose this city because of no input into the sea and it was filmed taxi in which he played a famous actor .
After spending two weeks with a fairy in France , we had to go back to school and fairy to do .

Last year I was in London with my friends , Elena , Amélie and Ariana .
At first we went to our hotel .
It is near to the Hyde Park .
We went to the Hyde Park and sat down on a bank .
A hour later we went to the London Eye .
It is really very very big .
In the London Eye we can look all over London .
It is a very big city .
Then we go to the Big Ben .
The clock is very big and we stood there a long time .
Then we go to a red bus and drove to our hotel .
London is a very exciting city .
Speaking about reading .
Reading is one of the most important habits .
Reading opens new horizons , made you imagine .
One of the most favorite books for me is , the power of your subconscious mind .
this book tells you how to use the power of your mind , and how to make yourself happier .
I wish I could spread the idea of reading among young people .
Reading is a must for having a great nation .
letter written to report , about awful environment situation in my city !
Kiev , Ukraine .
we already did a lot , but still to do more needed .
first of all , rubbish factories should be sent behind the city
people who litter on the streets its one of the biggest problems .
So my proposition is to post some informative letters and posters around the city , and give bigger punishment for littering!Also from the government side to increase of trash bins and facility staff members .
clients search , customers support , conflicts solutions
compilation of wedding arrangements and bouquets
People used to use public transport a lot .
Public transport is very inconvenient .
Gas prices have come down a lot .
People can afford cars easily .
Some people live very far from the bus stop .
They have to walk a long distance to get to the bus stop .
Buses are very crowded .
Buses take a very long route .
It takes you very long time to get to your destination .
If you have a car you can get to your destination in a short time .
Our town takes care of the enviremont of our neighbourhood very seriously .
There are many places where you can throw away your rubbish .
On these sites there are different kinds of containers for all sorts of rubbish which you can collect at home .
Like glass , plastic or paper -containers .
The centre of our town , where the supermarket is , does also have a site for dumping your rubbish .
In the supermarket you can find a container for batteries .
Not only the supermartket has these containers , they are also in the schools of the neighbourhood .
In my opinion this gives a good example of the involness of the local government .
Another point where I 'm pleased about is that our town is kept clean by a special group of employees of our community .
This happens weekly .
They walk around in all the streets and pick up all the dumped material .
This makes our neighbourhood a pleasant place to be .
For the last I can say that they not also put containers for all your rubbish , but even special containers in the parks for the the dogs their ' pooh ' .
So this helps that the children could play in a much cleaner park .
Studying overseas is not only changing condition , but also facing many sorts of unknown pressure .
Roughly speaking , there are three causes of pressure .
First of all , the biggest problem is studying .
It is not easy to adapt a new learning environment , the language is the biggest difficulty .
Students have to do assignments with another language and use different thinking manner .
The second problem could be from peers ' stresses .
The culture shock is that international students need to overcome .
Students want to make new local friends , but cultural customs and taboos could be a problem to be noticed and adapt .
Lastly , the problem is from students themselves .
Leaving comfort zone , and everything is fresh .
Students have to confront and get over every challenge .
As family and friends do not accompany , students must do a lot from basic living to future studies .
It is hard to live overseas alone , Therefore , making friends from the same country can assist one another .
Besides , attempting open mind .
To get along with international friends is a great way to expand horizon .

Report on the shopping facilities in Katowice
Introduction
The aim of this report is to describe and assess shops , which could be interesting for tourists .
The majority of people visiting Katowice are focused on three matters : sovenirs , fashion and food .
Souvenirs
It seems that there is not many places in city center where you can find souvenirs like postcards or books about the history of Katowice .
Fortunately , visitors would find all of that in the Tourist Information Ofiice and in shops on the outskirts .
The one , which is really worthy to see is " Kato - Sovenirs " .
They provide all sorts of funny local gadgets .
Fashion
My favorite sport is football .
It 's the most popular sport all over the world .
I enjoy it because it 's well known and easy to find partners to play with .
Watching football is also a wonderful experience .
My favorite international league is the English premiere league .
My advice to anyone who will start this sport is to start it early and play it regularly not to loose fitness .
Also joining a team will be a great idea .
The environment is an important part of our life contributing in a positive way in our part of life without even concern about important parts for us to survive .
Humans can easily damage the environment just throw their waste without recycling or ruin the places where animals are living .
Deforest the woods can damage the cycle of nature .
Without forest ca n't be animals and the human being can disappear .
Some people do n't even care and just the do n't to earn money deforests the trees and sell to do furniture .
They even are not plant other trees .
I notice that in supermarkets are using so much plastic just to cover a small thing or are using many plastic bags without even think how vulnerable is for the environment .
I used to live for a short time in a place where word recycle was completely ignored but they used to this because that was n't so rich .
Where I live now I noticed that have the opportunity to recycling the waste because it is a posh area .
In my opinion I think the government should take care of all area , even is a poor or rich area .
The pollution has a negative contribution to the environment .I saw on television that wild birds are healthier in rural area than birds from urban area .
Birds from urban area is difficult for them to find a proper food instead .
Some people from area which I live they used to feed the birds but others they do n't even care .
To keep all the nature alive we must contribute everyone of us for future generation .
Travelling by car is more comfortable than public transport , easier and faster .
you can go by your car and at any time , but you ca n't by public transport .
you must not wait for your car but you must wait the public transport .
you do not pay any fees to travel by your car .

To conclude I want to say that I 'm the godfather of his eldest son .
My wife is a very special person to me , I like her very mush .

Hi , my name is John Keats and I 'm aged 21 .
I am writing to apply for your job offer .
I have already worked in summer camps in France and in Italy for children aged 7 - 13 . I am cheerful , energetic and hardworking .
I usually work in the kitchens so it does not bother me .
Moreover , I am willing to help organize sports or evening activities .
Moreover , I do like looking after children .
For instance , I take care of my nephews once a month because nowadays my brother is often busy .
I can go all over the USA without any problems and I can help the staff to get around if needed since I have the driving license .
Therefore I think that I am the suitable person for the job .
yesterday night , i went to a restaurant with my family ..
l love the place , nice decoration of restaurant .
the waiter come to us and took the order .
my family ordered the dinner but l ordered specially pizza and coke because l love pizza .
we ate the food and enjoyed a lot .
l love that day spent with my family ..
l wish l have come at weekends with my family and friends .
This report is about how my city takes care of the environment .
The evolution of my city is more or less similar to the evolution of my country .
I am living in the center of Spain , in a small city .
When I was child , my city was dirty because people were throwing their rubbish on the floor .
However , a few years ago the government has paid more attention to the environment to our country ; for example they made a lot of advertisement on televion , in newspapers and on the internet to explain that the rubbish is not good for our world .
Nowadays , we can see in all street a lot of bins and it is difficult to see rubbish on the floor because many people are cleaning the city .
Also , children must clean their school once a month .
These types of actions produce good habits in our society .
In the future , we must do an effort to improve our environment because we will want to give the same world or if it is possible a better world than before to our sons .
No body can deny that transportation is one of the most important things in our life .
No country can live without transportation as it 's the real meaning of connection between each other .
Cars are much convenient but this not mean that all other means of transportation are not important .
sometimes many people want to travel faraway along distances so they need planes .
other people prefer to travel by trains as it 's faster and more comfortable than cars .
Many countries like to travel by bikes in order to decrease the pollution which happened by car exhausted.to my point of view i prefer travelling by cars which is more comfortable .
Now in every country we have lot of transportation means as planes , trains , undergrounds , cars , ships , and rockets .
public transportation is the mean reason to delivery people everywhere in a small time . in the past the had to use camels to travel which waste lot of time and tiredness .
Today our life is running by clock .
We need a vehicle to reach our work place .
If we use our public transport services .
we may be late to office / working place .
So we must use the personal vehicle .
Everybody thinking like the public transport is not comfort for us , but environmentally the public transport is suitable to decrease the pollution and our energy sources also decrease .
In Lublin is a beautiful castle .
It is my favourite place in Lublin .
It is located next to the Old Town .
It was built in twelfth century .
The castle 's look is in the Neo - Gothic style .
At the castle is Holy Trinty Chapel .
It is in a Gothic style .
It was built as a foundation of King Casimir the Great .
This is one of the most valuable monuments in Poland .
There is a tower by the castle in the Roman style .
This tower is a precious monument of roman art and it is one of the oldest building in the Lublin .
It was a part of the borough castellan .
Castle also has a courtyard .
Now on the castle is a museum .
It to belong to the oldest and the biggest museums in eastern Poland .
This museum has a monuments of the superiority .
In my opinion it 's the one of the most fascinating place in Poland and the most wonderful site in Lublin . I think that everyone should visit this castle .
The restaurant that I will talk is Woody Pool .
Woody Pool is in Spain .
This restaurant has a good atmosphere because it is always people laughing and talking about funny things .
The food in this restaurant is very good and has a subnormal size because it is much bigger than the useful food .
The famous dishe of this restaurant is a huge hamburgure
This restaurant will be an amazing place to the call meet there because like I said before the atmosphere and food are amazing .
In my opinion , public transport will become more and more important in the future . Travelling by car maybe is convenient , but it also brings air pollution and traffic jams .
If in a city there were only cars , the city would n't afford enough parking lots and roads , all the cars would jam the city , and people would n't get their destinations .
On the other hand , cars need more gasoline than buses which let out CO2 and other kinds of waste gases into the air , leading to the serious air pollution .
So , what we need is to devote much more money and time to improve the public transport .
Public transport will have bright future ; on the contrary , travelling by car will vanish from our life .
My favorite way is Train .
Plane is most fastest in another way to travel .
However , plane is most dangerous way to travel .
Boat is the most cheapest in another way to travel .
However , boat is most slowest way to travel .
So , train is intermidiate way to tarvel .
My favourite sport is boxing .
Because I like boxing .
I like fight , because I like to hit someone .
I start this sport when I was 11 years old , my dad let me go to box and I start that sport .
Then I started to go with my friends .
I started leading trener in the competition and I love this sport .
My favourite boxer is Floyd Mayweather .
He is very good on this sport .
Today , the people use more cars , which leads to more cars on the street , traffic and pollution .
I think is better the idea that the people to use public transportation instead of using private cars or motorcycles
Firstly , people do not have to buy their own cars .
Accordingly , people do not have to spend lots of money on gas that they have to fill the tank .
Also , they do not have to find a place for parking as well .
Therefore , these are the reasons why I agree with the form to lower the congestion and air pollution by encourage people to use less private cars and turn to use more public transportation and other forms for transportation
It was a cold day at night when I was at home watching my favourite programme on my telly called " dare to win " , I was with my brother , when we decided to call , The programme is about questions for the contestants that must be answer in correct time , and there is a different things for the winner .
A few minutes later we were listening ourselves in the programme , we were so nervous but it was exciting for us , our goal in the programme was get a free ticket for the most popular electronic party in the world .
Despite our nervous we did it well ! and our dream come true , yeah , we 'll be glowing in the dark !
Funding for the English Language Club
As the secretary of the English Language club I am writing you this proposal to persuade you as to why it would benefit both the students , and the college if we would receive funding from you .
Dear sir or madam ,
I am writing to aplaay for the job in the USA , published in an advertisement , last Monday .
I had recently finished my course of english in Cambridge , also I have a fresh and improve English .
In order to help organising on sports and evening activities , I am a young person of 12 years old .
Many people say that there is no future for public transport as cars are now so much cheaper and easier to buy .
Additionally , because public transport is expensive and does not have a comprehensive coverage of most cities private cars are more attractive for most poeple .
Dear Bob .
I went to our new shopping centre last week at the downtown .
Actually I am very happy to tell you that we have a lot of new stores , including apple 's store .
Long ago we had no stores to buy products or whatever were our needs .
However from now one we can buying what we really need , on the other hand this shopping may help a lot of people get back working again .
A few weeks ago I went into apple 's store , so that I bought a new mobile phone , it is awesome because it has reliable tools which allows me doing my daily working .
Some people say that a tripp by car is more convenient that by the public transportation , but that statement has a lot of issues if we think about the limitations .
It is true that travel to a nearby place from your city , it is more comfortable getting there by car , and the ease of have your car to get wherever you want without spending money and time paying cabs .
But , the public transportation have a lot of future bacase a lot of reassons , first the time , if the place you want to reach finally is really far the different type of vehicles of public transportation will get you there faster than your car , also the complications about the field , like if you want to go from America to Europe there is no highway that cross the ocean you need an airplane and unless you have one , you will can not reach travel between continents with your car , a different reasson is politics , because if you want to go from anywhere in the USA to Alaska you will not need to pass through Canada , the commodity is a really important reasson because drive for 8 hours is exhausting and it will be unsafe also , the economics is a factor to , because the attrition of your car it will be more that in the normal use and the price of food and extra stops that you will need to do , it will be expensive that in public transportation .
In conclusion , for me it is a lie that the public transportation has no future , however , they have to make improvements to this like the use of better ways of fuel or energy , one way is using renovable sources of energy such as solar , haeolic ( wind ) or hidraulic(water),Also there are biodisel , and gasoline extracted from seaweed .
And the public transportation will be more important in a few years than now .
Dear Anne . Thank for your letter asking about my fmily and my Friends .
Saying that , my family is the best and they love me much .
I have a father , a mother and a brother .
My brother lives in Barcelona with him girlfriend and he is very happy with her .
I live with my parents in Lagartera and I am very happy as they help me .
Also , I have very Friends .
They are wonderful because they are always when I need them .
Nowadays , It is possible to find any kind of Tvs programmes you want and yes , I consider that there is very much sport on television , but , not too much .
The way of life of people has began more and more stressful .
When somedoby to get at home he wants only relax in front of Television .
Besides this , Tvs companies have understood sports provides this relaxess moment , mainly for men .
Then It put on Televison more and more sports programmes .
In this view , I consider , though , there is lots of sports on Televison , they are not too much , because the people have looke for it .
In conclusion , I think that Tvs companies only want to sell their product and the people want to have their relax moment with the sports programmes .
Last summer , we went to Córdoba to attend a very important dance competition ...
We left from our city on Monday , and we arrived Carlos Paz on Thursday .
We stayed in one of the most beautiful hotels in that place , with a nice view and with nice people around .
When the day came , we performed an amazing coreography and we went back home with 3 gold medals .
We really enjoyed this experience , just because we shared it as friends and we took dance lessons with the most professional and privileged dance teachers of the world .
The album American Beauty/ American psycho is the sixth album released this year by the well - known American rock band Fall out boy that has a huge followers in several countries .
The album with eleven tracks that reach top one , won a gold and silver certifications for the best - selling in diverse countries as the USA , Canada and the UK .
This American band is known for their lyrics that hold something different from other the bands something close to a emocional statement .
Even in this albums that the band abandon their own root and add a bite of the pop genre in it .
I really recommend this album because of the lyrics and the sound because it catch you , almost like a great poetry .
I agree with the statement that people 's live will change dramatically in the next years , for previsible reasons that I will explain in following text .
Firstly , the biggest reason that people 's live will extremely change in the future is because of technology .
Technology is increasing in all the world .
New technology has improve systems in many areas society , mainly in Information Systems .
The Information trhough of the Internet , had beem each day more quickly and it is reaching all parts of the world .
Furthermore the things and process is in evolution .
Life of people is turning easiest and comfortable .
On industries , the big machines is making new products for our welfare .
Although , the advancement of technology , besides than bring advantages for everyone , it 's also will cause disadvantages , such as unemployment because machines will make the same or work better than humans .
that 's why I agree that people 's live will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
USA Summer Camp , I am interested in he vacancy of the summer camp .
I 'm cheerfully , diligently and organized person .
And also I love children .
I am accustomed to work with children because the last two summers I worked in summer camps and I have two little sisters that I love them and which I spent a lot of hours take care of them .
I am a hardworking and a committed person in all aspects .
They are the reason why I 'm great for these job .
Also the last summers helped me to be preparing on more things that the children demand children .
For an example I learned about the organization , how control big groups of children , and entertaining activities for children .
I hope you get interested In my application .
I will be waiting for your answer and thank you for the time .
Nowadays , cost to buy a car that can take the whole family is not expensive anymore .
Car is not an expensive thing to have anymore .
As we know , the privilege having a travel by car is more convenient than by public transport .
We could stop in everywhere we want to stop .
We could visit every places with no limitation time .
If there was someone who asked me " What is your favorite sport ? and why are you enjoy it ? " I would tell that my favorite sport is soccer and it could let me know how important the team work is and I could always feel that there was a kind of power , like someone putting me into the water from the high place , to push me running and kicking the ball .
I had to say that feeling was really awesome .
It made me feel like that happiness is running through out my body .
I will suggest people who want to starting this sport , first you must find five to six friends to make a team , and then look for other friends to make another team , so that you can fight with other to get the score .
second , all you have to do is warm your body , if you do n't warm it before the race you might hurt yourself .
Third all you can do is play for fun with your friends .
what is it the best ?
Public transport , our cars or natural transport as a bike .
My techer said that public transport has not future in our society , because travelling by car si so much more adecuate , never the less I am disagree with her opinion because if we use public tranposrt we will pollute less .
No one can deny the importance of travelling .
Without travelling people would be very bored , life would be very monotunes .
So , in the future we will dispense of types of transportation .
In these days , we use cars to travel between countries .
Cars are very easy to use .
People ca n't dispense of cars these days .
Families ca n't dispense of cars .
So we should know the right way to drive .
We should be careful when we drive .
We should be careful from careless drivers .

In the past , it was n't like that , people had not had cars , they were only rely on puplic transport .
They had no chose , because life was difficult , no money .
There were not company cars.but now most people have cars .
There are a few people are using puplic transport , like students and someone had low income.in my veiw , i can say might be the puplictransport going to e close because nobody is going to beclose
Last week my class and another one went to a school tripin Sicily .
We visited many cities like Taormina , Siracusa , Agrigento , Marsala and Trapani , and we saw a lot of monuments of Greek history .
We stayed in three different hotels and one day , we went also to the sea in Giardini Naxos .
The best thing I saw was the Valley of the temples , because there were a lot of ancient temples and monuments and ruines and they were really beautifuland also the panorama was amazing !
That day , there was a great time and it was sunny and hot ; I took a lot of photos and I learned new particulars about these important buildings .
It was a fantastic trip and I hope to do similar trips like this !

Nowadays , a very popular topic among teenagers is existence cosmic creatures .
To be honest I do n't believe in Ufo .
on the world recorded a lot of cases where the ufo was seen .
ufo story started already in antiquity .
on the walls of caves are sketches and paintings which show strange creatures and flying sauceres .
universe is colossaling and still we are knowing little about it .
maybe we do n't be alone and ufo exist ?
in addition more and more scientists agree with alien really exist
I am person that like going to do exercise , for this reason I like practise some sports , but the truth is that my favorite sport all around the world is the soccer .
I believe that play soccer is an excellent activity , because in every game that the people can like always has to exist some rules .
This kind of rules are very important , in my opinion , because when you do an activity and comply with the rules you are being a better person .

He studied at University a Degree in Law .

I have played this sport for twelve years ago this sport has taught me to respect the other not assault to him.there is the only reason that makes me choose this sport is I do n't want to be weak I would n't like to be nothing in this country that has a rule Strong dominated the weak.when I put my feet in the gym i forget everything shcool , home ... therefore I enjoy it .
I ca n't imagine my life without taekwondo it is my blood , my soul.taekwondo it is not a violent sport as many people say but what you have to know is what in the brain and the heart of players .
I just get the 1st degree international black belt and I would like to tell to anyone he just starting this sport use your abilities and skills for the right things .

Our Future 's Lives :
The past already happened , we can not change it .
The future we do not know what 's coming .
But the present we live it , we live the moment and benefit from it at the maximum .
If you ask someone about the future , answers will be different but all will be around two main topics , Those last are either optimist future or pessimist one .
As far as I am concerned .
I do believe that people 's lives in the future will change toward the bad .
No because I am pessimist but due to several factors and condition allow me to divulgue my opinion .
Firstly , we are living in unstable world .
It is true that every day we have new innovation which help people and make their life more easier .
But from life 's experiences we can learn that the hidden target of human is not to help each other to lessen the burden of life .
Human are looking for a power and they are applying forest law , The stongest beat the weakest .
To illustrate .
There are a categorisation of countries , there are developed countries , emerged one and on the way of development countries .
Who classified those countries like this ?
whare the critria of this ranking ? and ...
These questions and a lot of queries of many people looking for convenient answer .
Hence , The above indicates details support the idea that there will be a change in people 's lives but in negative side .
In addition , A general vision on the human innovation show that the majority of people creations have bad effect , this effect exist even in people 's lives or themselves .
And unfortunately this bad impact exist almost in all lives filed .
For example .
Chemical drugs can help peolple to heal and improve from diseases but have another hidden effect .
This effect always leaves people suffering later after the usage .
Therefore , The afformentioned information above show that our future can be worse than our present .
To summarize , People 's life knows a fast change and development , but generally this evolution affecting people .
Should live in stabele and peaceful world .
We must stop all wars , conflict and impose human beings principls and values .
The restaurant I 'm going to review is called Tintos y Rubias and is located in downtown Montevideo .
It is specialized in barbecue , beers and wines .
The infrastructure of the place is quite wide and in the front side you can see a huge welcome sign .
The restaurant has a rustic design and it has outdoor tables .
The service provided by the restaurant is exceptional for example , the waiting time is very short .
And it is very well ordered .
In terms of food quality the level is extraordinary , they are well known for their roast meat .
There will be a future for public transport .
Petrol will run out in a few years .
We can produce electricity by creating wind wheels and water wheels .
Trains are going to be used evermore .
Public transport is going to be used more than ever .
There wo n't be enough space on the roads for cars one day .
There is a hotly debated issue of that whether student should take at least one year to work or travel before they go to university .
And the topic of people 's view can be approached from different angles due to its complexity .
Some people prefer this " gap year " theory while others seem to prefer disagree .
After careful considering this issue , I also develop my own points of view .
I favor the former statement , that is , I think student should have a gap year before they go to university , based on n1 , n2 .
Dear teacher ,
I agree with you about the future for public transport .
I am sure that there is a good future for it .
Every day , the combustible that we get to our cars is more expensive than use the public transport .
Nowadays , people use their cars to move for work , for holidays ...... but if the petroleo were cheaper , they could travelled very much .
It could be a good idea if the taxes were cheaper than the taxes of other things such a tobacco , alcohol ....
Thus , people could spend their free time travelling and having a good time .
what do you think about that ?
although traveling by car is really interesting but still using public transport has its advantages , by using public transport you 're saving effort when driving a car for along distance you will get tired , some people do n't have enough money to buy their own car .
I saw you uploading the cat into the glass bottle in Facebook .
I want to give you a few words .
Maybe you just think it 's fun but it 's been a good cause for your cat because of you 're joking .
If you want to raise animals , you must take care of it , love it and treat it like a family .
Although it is not human , they also have feelings .
You raise it once , it would regard you as the owner .
You are only relying on it .
I hope you will decide to cats do not let it hurt in future .
Furthermore , you abuse cat has violated not only the ethics but also the law .
I hope you can take down photos of being abused the cat and you can really reflect . Do n't repeat the same mistakes .
To keep the cat is not a simple matter which need to real love and good care .
So you decided to keep the cat must be the best , you can spend more time with the cat .
At any time to pay attention to the cat has not been sick .
The holiday you can go for a walk with a cat .
It is not difficult to do the thing .
As long as you are determined , you will be able to become a good master .
The diagrams below show the five stages aboout the process of making bank notes .

The most important step is Inspection : printed sheets manually inspected .
if you apply job like this must be the person who already been applied this job USA SUMMER CAMPS

Therefore , to look after children aged 8 - 12 years old is n't easy task , but as a father or parent you must always given them good care in terms of your responsibilities .
Working in the kitchens means to do all about i.e cleaning and washing the floors .

There is no future for public transport , that is true , but I think that people are very comfortable and do n't think about the environment .
On the other hand , the public transport is the cheapest way to travel , although people do n't think of that aspect .
Secondly , you can drive your car everywhere , It does n't matter what time it is or where you would like to go . Travelling by car is much more convenient and comfortable than travelling by bus , by subway or by train .
In your car you can put inside all bags that you want to take .
These aspects or advantages are that I can say about this topic .

Motorola It was the first doing something to a mobile phone was on 3 April 1973 the first to do so was an employee of Martin Cooper
Cooper made mobile phone history in April 1973 when he made the first ever call on a handheld mobile phone
After that , with the new technology they could invent new and better dispositives for the needs of users

My wife and I went to Ushuaia for four days but at the second day we realised that my wife had forgotten her glasses so we decided to come back .
When we arrived there were a lot of Matias'friends in our house listening loudly music , playing games and drinking .
We told them that had to leave our house immediately .
When everyone was out , we told of Matias because he organised a party without our permission .
He told us that he was really embarrassed about what had happened and he apologysed for her attitude
In my opinion , in future people do n't be used public transport .
It will be not tredy because everybody will have his own car .
These cars will be used alternative energy , for example energy of the Sun .
The modern science try to find new , more economic sources by energy .

Secondly , the student have a good body shape can easily to make new friends , and joining a sports team allows students to maintain good body shape .

Therefore , the student joining a sport team can maintain good body shape and it will let student become easier to make new friends .
Peter looked at his watch and knew he had to do something immediately .
It is said that when you survive to a situation which has made you be at the limit , you change .
And you can never return to be the one you used to be .
You are no more the person that people have expected .
But you do n't care about it .
Every hard situation may be got over easily when you make a big effort .
Peter has been thinking about this secret party for months since the time he knew his mother was healed .
He was taking care of her so that he was prevented from going to university .
He had to refuse to all his dreams suddenly .
However , the destiny has given him another chance to follow them .
Despite his strange behaviour , Peter 's mum did n't expect it at all .
She felt blessed as she was given such a perfect son .
It is said to happen once in life .
Peter has been kissed by her mum before , but this time was quite different .
Maybe he did n't notice it at all , but it was a farewell .
Now Peter could fly on his own .
Environment is the combination of air , earth , water forest and all these are interlinked with each other .
Most importantly , all species of animals and human being are the part of this ecosystem .
Human is the most wise and intelligent from all of these .
However , he is mainly responsible for disturbing this ecosystem with various activities .
Lets talk about one of them , that is ' cleanliness ' Nowadays , we all know that we are spreading the garbage near our houses and offices .
This may be due to people are not aware about consequences of this bad habit- spreading the rubbish .
But , in these days , with education , people are becoming more sensible and responsible towards the environment .
In the same line , dwellers of my village are doing lots of work to make their area clean and hygiene .
They collect house hold waste in a dustbin and put off with proper standard procedure .
They collect and segregate the rubbish in separate containers .
For example , they collect plastic waste in yellow dustbin while , liquid and solid , degradable waste in red container .
This makes easy and convenient to identify the waste types .
To conclude , I would like to say that nowadays people are becoming more aware and conscious towards environment through education .
Today in my class there was a discussion on television education .
Television is an object that help people to know the news in real time .
There are advantages and disadvantages ; television can also cause an dipendence , cartoons and " stupid " program can damage mostly young people .
Today there are many children that have the dipendence on television , they prefer to stay at home to watch the various child tv programs , while once our parents preferred hang out with your friends .
Television can be a useful strument if it is used with caution , accordingly I recommend use less it for prevent damage to the mental level .
I am concerned about pollution .
This issue has became a big problem to solve .
In order to help reduce contamination I take acction from the three " R".reduce , reuse and recycle as so I am more and more ecofriendly .
I reduce use of innecesary power at home , in other words , I turn on light that I need for the while i use it;I take less warm shower ; I hit only neccesary rooms .
In order to reuse , I convert all thing reusable , for example , plastic bottle as a plant pot ; glass bottle as a food container;I bring my reusable shopping bag and refuse to use a shopping plastic if a salemen offer me to bring .
Recycling is another way to be ecologist .
Today , we have more item to recycle as long as we clean properly and put in a proper bin , which will be use it by specialized factory in another item .
As long as i try to keep doing thing on a ecofriendly way i realize that i am give a little from my side and i feel careful of my environment .
Hello!!How are you ! !

PD : we have to meet
Hï Jo ,
In my opinion , it is a good idea about you spend some time travelling because you will have an opportunity to think about your future but in my city because of the crisis there is very little work for everyone .
Here , there are monuments , churches or famous people and perhaps to you in the future you would like to become a history teacher .
Although now that the holidays are coming you need people to help and ride the amusement park or the lights of the fair .
If you come to Linares could amuse you and if you come forward to work can do it
You have to come here because Holy Week in Linares is nice and the show is spectacular and if you want to have fun and I like the bulls
I hope to see you soon
Sonia
Hi Sara ,
It was great to hear from you .
It 's a very difficult decision for me too .
But if you want to decide , I 'll intend to help you .
On the one hand , you need a sport to keep fit .
On the other hand , music is the best for relaxing and enjoy .
Well , I think you should n't give up either .
You can devote more time to do both .
If I were you , I would go running at the morning and I would go to music classes after lunch .
So , you can do both .
I hope this help you and you will take the best decision .
Lots of love
Fira
I agree this affirmation because the public transport is more expensive than car , is slow and is less economic .
the car is less expensive , more confortable , more fast and more security .
every time the car is more utilized and more economic .
in my opinion the car more advantageous than car and the car is more useful
To my mind this mind not right .
First of all travelling by car is very expensive .
For example travelling by train is cheaper and travelling by plain is faser .
Secondly it 's not comfortable.becouse you every day drives instead of relaxing and enjoy the enviroment
Using public transport has certain advantages and also , disadvantages .
It is said that people prefer going by bus to a close place , but some of then do n't think the same .
The public transport has plenty of advantages .
Some people ca n't afford to buy a car or to pay for oil , as it is constantly rising , so using a public transport is an economic way to travel .
On the other hand it helps to reduce the polution made by cars , ..
Besides , it will be always useful for people ca n't drive .
Many people admit that if they could buy a car , they would do it .
The reason is they are tired of using public transport and they would get earlier to everywhere .
In the future , cars would be so cheap than everyone will have one , thus , it will take up the end of the public transport .
To sum up , I would say that people will use more and more public transport , as the oil is getting expensive .
The picture illustrate the progrocess of making notes .
There includes some most important steps .
Design is the first and the most important process .
It is the first step that costs troublesome , some things must be included the considerations , such as background colour , artwork , security issues .
Then , preparation of mental plates and skilled machinists are the needments .
Printing is the next step , .Usually , sheets of bank notes printed , because there are some special require for the printing , solour of both sides , special ink , images slightly raised .
The last step is the inspertion , sheete manually inspected .
The inspection always have three results , the good quality sheets , the bad sheet or the partially damaged sheets .
If the print sheets has good quality , they will packing and distribution.some partially damaged will cut into separate or packede or dispatched .The bad sheets will disposal , the destroyed will be secure .
My favorite sport is swimming .
I goes swimming since 1998 , when I had ten years old .
I like swimming because I feel a good sensation and my health is good .
Actually I not practice because I am not time , But a feel miss !
Now I go to the gym and practice weight lifting three Times A week , Exercises aerobics every days and yoga two times a week !
I every feel very well after come back the gym .
Often I go to the gym with my friend , Vanessa ,
But when she ca n't go I go Alone .
I always go !
My cough is very friendly and help me
The television is one of the most important AV media in the world .
You can use it for many purposes , according to your needs .There are a lot of channels in many roles , for instance , education , movies , songs , sports , news and so on .The television is not only for entertainment but also for education .The television can entertain you through it 's entertained channels , and the television can educate you through it 's educational channels .
At this time and age , most of the people have their own car or vehicle for their transportation .
It is also make convenient for people who are rushing time to work , meeting and so on .
However , I have no agree with this statement because the public transport is needed for someone who are no have vehicle or economic downturn .
Public transport is cheap and friendly for environment .
firstly , the fare of public transport is cheaper compared with buying a new car .
The person that do not have to save large amount of money to buy the car .
They can use the money in more useful or meaningful way such as investment property .
The fare of public transport is less than own vehicle when compared fare of bus to fulfill whole tank of oil .
Some more they are needed to pay a parking fee for parking .
Secondly , air pollution is a serious problem nowadays .
Because of everybody has to leave for another place through their own car and carbon dioxide released from the car .
The public transport is a way to reduce the air pollution because it can carry more than a dozen times the people in a time and reduce their own vehicle .
So , it can also help to reduce the traffic jam problem .
Lastly , public transport that are always blamed by the people that are slowly and trouble than own vehicle .
Although the public transport is slow but it also do not take a long time of people to reach their destination because public transport nowadays are developed more fast and enough .
In conclusion , public transport is needed for everybody in a necessary time .
It always can make us save the money and make the environment more nature and fresh .
Nowadays , the space for countries enlarges , instead of which , the area for farmland , forests and wetland is getting smaller .
This kind of situation brings all kinds of problems to mankind and animals .
The large - scale building projects took the space which should belong to the animals .
The food for them and their living space might not be enough .
Some kinds of animals would move to the urban area , steal the food from us and sleep on the streets or in the underground .
However , most of them might be arrested .only a little number of them might be adopted by those friendly human .
On the other hand , the expansion of city increase pollution of all kinds of garbage . The air pollution is much more serious now , and watching the blue sky is almost impossible in some big cities .
Although the medical skills get stronger , the percentage of people who get cancer is still improving .
In conclusion , the large - scale building projects take the living resource from animals , increase the possibility of getting cancer and so on .
Only if the government develop more technical property , pay more attention to the environment protection , such as build more trees and grass in the cities , and set a special low for those missed animals will help decrease the harm that the building project brings to us .
For me , my family members are not my best friends although I wish they are .
If they are your best fiends they will guide you and help you to be to be the best of you , they wo n't hurt you or turn their back on you .
But on the other hand you maybe punished or they may yell at you when you do something wrong .
So it is not always a good thing , unless they are open - minded or have their own methods to punish you in a gentil way that wo n't make you regret telling them your faults or mistakes .

You can only arrive at ' A Fervenza ' walking or riding a bike , but it is impossible to get there by other ways .
It is an invledible forest place , the ground is full of low grass and there is a little river where you can swim , is is the perfect place to have a quiet day .
That is all I can tell you about this place . I hope tath my answer will help you with your project .

To combat the distriction of enviornment , this is a serious problem throughout the world .
Nowadays , many trees and grasses are damaged in many countries , lots of building are constricated .
And people should pay attention to this problem and try to slove it .
There are denying that the environment are changed by behavior of people and animals .
For instance , people need to many places to build the modern society , so they fall down lots of trees , burnning many glasses .
Another factor that the animals are not control themmselves to eat the plaints lend to distriction of ecosystem .
Nowadays , the transportation become more prefect , and the people'life become more convenient .
Althought this change lend the life of people efficient , the problem should not be ignored .
It would really be helpful if the government make tighter resrictions , in today 's world , lots of constrication companies and factories are not admission , they are destroyed the forest , farmland and wetland , charging waster water and emitting greenhouse gas , it lead to a serious enviorment problem .
So the government should oversee this companies , and if companies do not obey the rules or laws , it will be fined and closed .
Second , the government should publicize the awareness of protection
Taking the train is more cost effective than taking a car to work as petrol is costly and the new transportation office has reduced the cost of tickets to assist with the daily living expesnes we encounter .
The other benefit if taking public transport is less people are taking cars reducing the amount of toxic gases released into the environemnt .
Abortion is an immoral act that people make as everyone has a chance to survive and nobody has the right to decide for anyone life .
Abortion has to be taken seriously in order to avoid these immoral action as these fetus are being deprive of their right since they have already a life .
People had to be sensitize about abortion in order to decrease the number of women being abort .
Furthermore , abortion is very dangerous and a great number of women had been death with this .
Children has to be protected before and after life , it is why abortion has to be stop
In my opinion , I believe the public transport will have big role in the future due several reasons :
1- Inflation in population , the roads will not bear or endure huge numbers of cars .
2- I think on the future and transport and roads will be more organizing more than these days .
3- In the future people will concern more about energy , so transport will be more useful .
4- Transport more economical from independent cars .
5- Many people ca n't drive like children and old people .
6- Not everyone has the ability to buy a car .
Cause all these reasons I believe the transport will have big future .
From 1st Qtr to 2nd Qtr the sales increased by $ 100 .
Then , from 2nd Qtr to 3rd Qtr the sales increased by $ 250 .
Next , from 3rd Qtr to 4th Qtr the sales remained steady in $ 850 .
The last sales of the last year was $ 850 .
From 1st Qtr to 4th Qtr the sales increased by $ 350 .
karate is one of the best sports i have ever enjoyed in my life .One of the reasons behind my passion for karate is that it 's means of tamming the mind and the body .
I have learned to get control of myself when someone teaes me , and to be alert as well .Also , it helps to look always slim and put me away from the ghost of obesity as well .People who want to start playing karate have to be patient .
They should emerse themselves in daily exercises as well as eat healthy meals to keep them active .for instance , it 's adviced to eat great amounts of fruits and fresh vegetables because they contain a lot of vitamins that the body needs to work properly .

Hi Elena
How is going ?
Thank you for your letter !
What 's a big surprise , you are married .
My congratulations .
I got your beautiful postcard and your invite .
I 'm very pleased to your invite .
Now I 'm thinking about the present , what do you like ?
I look forward to hear from you .
Bye , Sandra
sports is very much beneficial for our health .
i would like to play football because it 's too much exciting game . in proportion to length it takes only 90 minutes . whenever i got the opportunity i played football .
Driving car while listening to music is much more fun for most of people so maybe that 's why mostly love to drive than taking public transport .
In contrary some guys hate getting caught in traffic jam so prefer public transport;some other reasons may be rising gas price , car crashes or hating driving !
As a result I thought both driving and public transport have their roles and we need to take each in the right situation .
I prefer to travel by train .
I have two reasons why I think so .
First , there are many kinds of types which train has .
For example , in our country , " Shinkansen " which measns burrett train is famous and very fast .
" Blue train " which has many beds in train and we can sleep comfortabully in train .
Thus , not only to ride but also to watch train is very interesting for me .
Second , travelling by train is safe and reasonable conpared to plane .
Recently although there are many LCC careers we can choice , it is still expensive to travel by plane .
TTravelling by train is cheep and getting chicket is easy for us in our country .
And terolism is scare also .
The plane which travel from Egypt to Russia was explosed by terolist in last month .
Compared to plane , train is relatively safe because it can move only on the land .
These reasons are why I think traveling by train is favourable .
Hello Julia ,
How are you ?

what kind of films do you like ?
I like thriller and the action films because they have never been boring .
Do you prefer to watch films at home or go to the cinema ?
I prefer to watch films at the cinema because there are n't any distractions or noises and the quality of films are better .
See you soon .

Our earth is getting sick as days go by .
For example , air , water and land pollution .
There are several efforts that we can contribute in order to save the environment .
We start little by little to help it .
First of all , I want to emphasize on reducing the usage of plastics .
It 's the basic things and a habit that we can start easily from our own .
Plastics are non - biodegradable which degrade after 1000 years .
Non - biodegradable plastics could actually piles up the landfill and cause the land use in our earth to be occupied .
Besides , it destroys the marine ecosystem in such a way that the seabird or fish are fed on plastic .
This cause their reproduction system to be destroyed .
Hence , we should bring our own recycle bag or basket every time we go for shopping and resist temptation to get plastic from them .
Besides , we should use public transport or carpool in order to reduce the CO2 emission into the environment .
If the distance to destination is short , we could replace driving by walking or cycling .
That 's the descent way in reducing the adverse environmental impact and we are able to protect our Earth
Since GM crops technology started to be implemented it have implied in favourable socioeconomic changes .
This technique makes the weed control easier resulting in cost savings and yield gains , so that increase global production of crops such as corn , cotton , canola and soybeans .
he said kindly:"I buy you a present , open it , Tom "
Tom opened the big bag , Oh!This is a big surprise , there was a football in it , which he always wanted to buy
there were some words goal!keep doing ! keep looking!said her mom , Look !
there was also a cup in it , It said"don't give up your dream , keep doing!go!we stand by you!come on "
Tom love it , " thanks mom , thanks dad!"Today is the best day of my life , thank you ! "
" You deserve them , Tom ! you work hard all the time this year "
My name is Anna , i one of many new students at Ton Duv Thang university .
I 'm nineteen years old and from city but i living at domitory at Ton Duc Thang university .
It has 58 students : 18 boys and 40 girls .
I loves Ton Duc Thang university so much .
I likes the friendly students and helpful teachers .
I enjoys reading book , cooking , playing with dog and singing .
Moreover , i 'm loves music , i 'm often listen to pop music , R and B , and little Rap .
My favorite singer is Adam Livece .
These days people care about privacy and hence a personal car not only provides privacy but also convenience .
Hence , the new luxury cars are getting cheaper and powerful .
The speed of life has been fastened , people do n't have time to wait for a taxi or in the bus stop to get their work done , they want their work done in the blink of an eye .
So the need for bus has become unnecessary and our own cars are simply time consuming .
Everyone has a car .
Even kids started to learn driving at fifteen and most of the parents gift cars in their sixteenth birthday .
We can seen determine the future of transportation by differentiating the numbers of cars and buses .
Students have started to use their own cars than the bus .
So I think the future of public transportation is in darkness .
My favourite sport is cricket .
Cricket has become a part of me since when I was a kid .
Its very interesting sport .
Cricket brings a passion on me whenever and wherever its possible I find out a way to start the game .
I also watch cricket patiently .
Its known as the gentleman 's game .
The best part of this game is batting whether someone knows or not he first prefer to bat .
Batting has its own cherish .
So , I also prefer to bat and hitting hard rather than bowling .
Its very simple and wonderful sport .
If you play cricket you are surely going to burn many bad calories adhered inside your body .
In India cricket is worshipped and players are the lord .
The best part of this game is you can play with every age group at a single time .
I was very interested in making my career through this but due to my studies I ca n't take effort toward this .
So , if are going to play this sport do notice that there are some rules and be sure that you have all safety stuffs with you . Please do n't forget to take pleasure of batting first .
I hope you are going to play the best game on your part .
Next Monday , I am going to India .
I love India so much .
MY friend was travelling there , she was talking to me about it so much .
Indian people make an amazing food , but it 's so spicy .Indian people dance in amazing way .
India is the seventh biggest country in the world by area .
In India , it rains from June to September .
One day it was my dream to go there .
I am going to visit Delhi and Tajmahal .

Yes , I think it also can educate .
As times go by , technology is rapidly improving .
More and more gadgets are invented such as televisions , smartphones and so on .
There are lots of pros if we watch the television properly .
Using will not only gain the entertainment but also get the knowledge .
For instance , there are numerous program that we can choose .
It is a good time to turn to the entertaining program , when we feel bored and gaze the wall all the day .
Television provides educated varieties of channels as well .
Discovery channel is posture - oriented model example to educate .
We can learn how do the different animals feed on themselves .
Above the statements can ensure a rich and abundant live .
I think after 50 years many things will change . we will learn in our homes .
we won , t have schools .
we will do home works at home and send it to the teachers .
they will correct our tasks and send it again to us .
I think that we will order all we need on the internet .
There wo n't be super markets .
It wo n't be a post office because we can send any thing by the Internet .All jobs will be on Internet .
Every person will have a plane .
We will go to any place by plane .
We will have a robot servant .
They will serve us instead of human servant .
There will be any poor in the streets .
we will live happily .
I hope that the future will live peacefully and happily .
Hi , I am Amy . I would like to spend two months studying in English , two months doing volunteering in children charity and the least two months travelling in UK.What do you think of my plan?I will not only improve my English skills but also devote myself to get along with children .
The most important of all , I will take an adventure to the unknown place in UK.I am looking forward to seeing you soon .
I would like to invite you to join the road trip with me.it must be an amazing experience if we are together for this trip .
As long as you can go with me just let me know .
your friend Amy
My favourite sport is running .
I usually run in the morning , when my roommates are still sleeping , I get up and run in the playground .
I enjoy running , fresh air , warm sun and slight wind .
When I am running , all preesure I undertook has gone .
I am fill with hope .
I started running because I endured neck pain and my left leg is not comfortable when I sat all day .
Furthermore , I want reduce my weight as well .
I bought shoes , clothes and GPS watch , I told myself : now it is a challenge , I must defeat myself .The first day is so painful , I was tired to die when I just ran nearly 3 km , but things becomes better and better , and now I could run 10 km .
If you want to start running , firstly , you need a comfortable shoes and clothes , and secondly , make a plan , like how long should I run today , remember , appropriate rest is necessary .
Do n't make a goal that you ca n't reach , or you will lose your confidence soon .
the most important thing is your willpower .
First I will ask a question to you if this is your own house , you buy it with a lot of money and will you broke it with no reason ?
Of course the answer is no!Everyone knows that " Earth is our home."It is bigger than a house .
We have Eather first than people thanour house .
Eather is our home , we all have to protect it .
But now people are distroy it .
Just for mony for more house but if we destroy it we will all die our money will gone our house will gone we will have nothing .
Beside some people destroy farland to build houses but if one day there is no farmland than what should we eat?Nothing at that time we can eat nothing!So what should we do ?
Forest brings us fresh air bu8 t if there is no trees , what will happen ?
We ca n't breave we will die , too !
So my idea is aii the coutries allthe people stop to use farmland , forest andwetlang to build houses grow more trees portect our world , our homestar !
The lecture desagree with the paragraph , suggesting that the mention test developed by Alan Turing do not respond the mainly question : Can the computer think ?
First , the lecturer talks about " Saran " that propose a challange to prove that the Turing 's test was not conclusive , than he create a paradox .
He selected people to into in a chinese room , there was a computer in chinese language with diferente symbols , the american was a diferente behavior , they did not understand what was in the computer screen .
Different from the original test mention on the text , that all the participants were american and native speakers from that language , it was really easy to understand what was in the computer screen .
Second , the text support that the computers were evaluated by the own people that submited the test .
Not everyone can buy a car .
For many , there are other important expenses that need to be covered .
For example , for the young people in College the studies are more important , as well as books , seminars , travelling , etc .
Nowadays , Public Transport has become a very important way to go to work , to travel to other cities , or to simply go to visit a friend to the other side of the city .
I agree , for many people travelling by car is much more convenient , however , in my opinion , there is still a long future for public transport .
Dear Ronnie
I am happy to know about you .
Your plan sound great and I will be pleased to spend a few days with you and your family .
My grandmother is going to visit me in July so I would prefer suit you in August .
My smaller sister wants to go to the beach so that if she is not a problem she could come with us .
However she can stay at home .
I think it is more fun sleep together in your apartment . We could tell terror stories to each other at night , before sleep .
Maybe my sister could sleep in the studio .
I really like spend time on the beach but there are a lot of time so we could go to the swimming - pool if your parents say yes .
Too we could go to the bar to drink some juice or to go to eat an ice - cream .
Do not forget to write soon
Science , I just remember I always liked a car race , but one of my frevourite is a Formula 1 .
I like cars , and I like high speed that is why I love a Formula 1 races .
Formula 1 seson starts at erly spring and ends with a late autumn .
I try to watch every race every fournight and training a day before the race .
I like so much Ricki Rikonen , he is a ferrari team driver .
Ricki , is not the fastes driver on the track , but he drive very safety .
Ferrari making one of the fastes cars on the word , but this seson they are not so fast on the Formula 1 trac , how they were in the past .
If sameone like cars then should go to Formula 1 race to hear the bolid engine sound , I think that is the best voice which I have ever heard in my life .
Formula 1 it is also dangerous sport , the driver are exposed to the risk of accident at high speed .
I wish Good lack to all Formula driver !
Michael is one of the most important economist in the world , he wrote a lot of book about economy and finance in the USA and Europe .
He has decided to do a short essay about capital market abuse whereby he considered to travel to Italy and pick up some financial data from Italian central bank .
The key idea of this essay is the following : Italy in time of Berlusconi was almost entered bankruptcy however Michael is trying to avoid the Italian economy condition simply because he likes Berlusconi too much .
he received a lot of critics simply because many economists and econometricians in the world do not trust the source that he was used in his essay moreover they thought that he received money from Italian government .
After two years that his essay was released , he will understand that his essay was wrong moreover , Michael will want to apologise many people who read his essay thereby Michael now goes home , takes a cup of tea , goes to bed thus Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake
One day a man and his wife were trying to found a place shallow and without pollution for cultivate , they were poor ; they do n't have the necessary sources , but the husband work so hard because his wife had an accident it occurred one day that his wife was working in a campaign of conservation of animal in endangered , she went to a place in search of animals , she heard a sound in a dark place of the jungle so she went to investigated what was that , a creature that have never seen attack she , her partner only heard a shout and they found Lucy the wife of the man in the floor , they ask she if she is ok but he do n't answered so her partner toke it to the doctor , there the doctor said that she was ok but he will never hear again or only if she paid 1 000 dollar for a operation .
The man has already saved 500 dollar but it is not enough .
The son of Lucy and her husband one day he went to caved holes in the dirt for make a game , he make five holes and in the last one he found a brilliant jewelry that had been generations of gods so he started throwing that for play , one time that he take the jewelry , it consume the mind of the little guy and that cause that the jewelry liberated some sounds that only giants can hear so a mountain stand up that was the face of a giant and he perceive negative waves so he kill the guy because he had the most important relic of the gods .
It is very easy to spend hours getting entertained by television .
However , it is more difficult to educate .
It depends how the presenter delivers the topic .
I have learned a lot from television .
There are excellent examples of good quality television on the BBC .
What 's more there are countries around the world that lack teachers to go to remote areas to teach , that rely on television to teach .
Mistake ! !
oh no ! !
How could I do this mistake ! !
These were my first feeling when I did the mistake .
Like every one , I was a normal person learning & improving day by day little by little from mistakes .
I am writing to suggest a few ways what our college can do for the environment .
Firstly , how can the college save energy ?
In order to reduce energy consumption should be made so that as much as possible lectures takes place in the day time .
This would reduce energy needed for the light sources .
Secondly , what sort of things can we recycle in the college ?
It would be a good idea to recycle paper , glass , metal and plastic .
In order to improve the sorting , there should be a litter bins for each mentioned substances in classrooms , corridors and outside .
Furthermore , the student and tutors should be encouraged to use public transport , cycling or walking .
Finally , all the student should be taught lectures about the environment .
I hope I find the answers to your question in my letter .
Yours sincerely

Seoul , in Korea , has many places to visit which places people want to visit .
I will introduce some good places to visit .
firstly , people who prefer youth culture , I recommend Hongdae .
Hongdae is most appropriate to feel free and vibrant local area in seoul .
there are a lot of club , pub and bar , cafe , karaoke and has more facilities which you will be able to enjoy .
Hongdae has many kinds of places thus , but you will be concerned about drunk people when the late at night .
At the late night in Hongdae , lots of people drink with their friends and walk around on the street with in drunken condition themselves .
So you need to be careful that kind of people .
and then , let me tell you another place ' Duksu palace '
. you can experience 19 century Korean imperial architecture and Korean traditional custom .
there was the place of the Chosun imperials queen .
The palace is in the middle of the city , therefore , you may feel different mood between 19 century and this day .
And also , there is gift shop and cafe .
I hope to enjoy your trip in Seoul till you left our contury .

In conclusion , before read the article I have never realized the importance of using drama in an English class .
For sure I will apply those strategies in my professional life , because drama gives to students the opportunity of not just learn something in the classroom , more than that , is the opportunity that they use their knowledge in the pedagogical and social life .
With reference to recent advertisement about ' USA CAMPAMENT SUMMER ' , I would like to express my interest in the position for the job in the campament .
I am a hardworking person and a fun girl .
I know to cook delicious meals .
I lived since two years in England and I speak English .
Recently , I had worked babysitting since one year in a school .
I felt very happy with this job .
I like do activities with them also I feed them .
I think so I am the suitable candidate for this job , because I like the children and I have experience babaysitting also I work very well making the food .
I will wait phone call you to discuss the possibility of arranging an interview .
The Wheel .
I choose the wheel because is the most useful invention ever because thanks to it the human works make easier by example a way to move heavy objects , compared to some of the fancy gadgets that we have today the wheel was invented at a relatively late point of human history , he oldest known wheel found in an archaeological excavation is from Mesopotamia .
In China , the wheel was certainly present in 1200 BC , for earlier Chinese wheeled vehicles , 2000 BC .
The wheel was found in a settlement built on stilts over wetland , indicating that the settlement had some sort of link to dry land .
( Taken from http://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-technology/revolutionary-invention-wheel-001713 )
I would like to visit is Germany .
You can think ' why this ? '
It 's very simply .
In the school I study German and I like the language .
I think is a strong , maybe a bit hard to hear , but beautiful at the end .
My teacher told me some things about the country .
Added to what I know , make it attractive .
To this , we have to join the food and drinks ( who do n't think this ? ) .
Except estrange cases , who do n't like to prove the authentic German beer , or the Frankfurt sausages in the place where was invented ?
And the topic I like the most .
The History .
From Teutonic mythology to Hitler and the Second War World .
It 's an amazing history with lots of heroes and cries .
You can think anything but I think that is the better part of Germany .
Family plays an important role in our lives .
Family are the members that they never wo n't leave you alone , they give you love and happiness , they make your day!They are our best friends and family .
First of all , friends are important for us , we want a friend that we can share our secrets and problems .
But friends maybe in the future go away or hurt you!So you ca n't always based on them!For example , they need you until they find someone better than you and in the end they go away .
But family never let you go or family never go away from you !
However , the family is near you since the day you were born until forever .
The members follow you , and can based on them . You can tell whatever you want to them .
For example , if you are in a bad mood the first person that will come next to you , to make you smile is your mom or dad .
Mom and dad spent their life to grow up their children , to feed them , to love them !
In conclusion , Members of your family an important role in your life !
In the last years was improved the public transport system .
In the last edition of Pur Plus occurred an important discussion about the next plan of cities .
It presented a politician , an economist and two envirementalists .
They were talking about the problems of the public transport system and the results of new habits in this sector .
These people , those live in a city , do not take her own car or have not one .
This is a new age , which we live .
So will follow problems of these habits .
This makes me ponder , weather is a future of the old public transport system or should make a new system .
One argument of these topic , that more and more people live in cities .
There going to following some problems .
One of these are the jams .
Everybody own a car and nobody rent a car .
The car sharing system is n't common .
So will following more jams , if we do not change our habits .
The results , which will follow , will be the pollution of the environment .
So we need a new system .
There should be a ban of cars .
So we will stop the jam and so the problems of environmental .
But now we need more buses or another faster public transport systems .
But we should not forget , that these options do not alloy the environment .
Introduction
Have you drank under the legal drinking age in this past month ?
If yes , then you are one in the other 8.7 billion who have also drank under the legal drinking age . You may think that drinking underage will not do too much harm , but it can .
Teens should not drink under the legal drinking age because the teen could get into trouble with the law , the teen could cause harm themselves and others and can have a higher risk of alcohol dependancy later in there lives .
transport at Sudan is so expensive we suffer from the less and expensive transport here .
there are many kind of transport such as buses train and small cars called amgad an also taxi
This is an interested question becaus I beleive that my family is my best friends but at the same time they are not my friends .
My family is my best friends because they realy takes care off me when I needed them to .
They looks over me and help me when I am in troubles .
THis is important because it is important to have somebody to rely of .
But my family is not my best friends because you chose you friends but you do not chosen you family .
After all , family and friends are important .
The two maps show the changes which had taken place in the town of Shipsmouth between 1995 and 2010 .
Generally it can be seen that the city became more modern in 2010 than it before .
first of all , in 1995 shipsmouth was green residential city with two forests .
the two green area in the north - west and south - east concern had been replaced by apartment blocks and an airport .
No one can deny how much sport is very important to our life health .
my favourite sport is squash .
I start this sport since I was 10 years old.where my father was playing this sport also , but he started it when he was more greater than me , He was about 30 years old.where squash is one of the games that can be played in any age , I love this game because I find it making exercise to all the body in the same time , we are running in small place moving hands in stretched and different ways in the same time you are working your mind in the same time so it need caring and quik thinkink , as much exercise you will find down the road .
I think that any one wants to start sport can play squach which gives stretched and healthy body , in the same time this sport can be played for a long time of period without caring about the age .
squash sport also can be played individually as two players together or in team of 4 players.squash one of the very nice attractive sports
SWIMMING THE BEST SPORT IN THE WORLD
I have praticed swimming for 3 years , I am a good swimmer and I have competed in differents tournament of swimming .
The swimming is my favorite sport because in this sport I train all my body , is very relaxing and is the best sport in the world .
My favorite swimmer is Michael Phelps because He was the best swimmer in the world and I hope that He returns to olyimpic games at Rio de Janeiro in 2016 .
I need pratice for be the best swimmer in the world than Michael Phelps .
My favorite style is the butterfly and I always pratice this style because I want to improve .
I want to compete in United States in the most important tournament , in this competition participate the best swimmers of the world .
Some swimmers are Michael Phelps , Ryan Lochte , Peter Van de Hoogenband and others .
Nowadays it is easier to use the car instead of public transport .
Althouth public transport is cheep and more enviermental , they are not so flexble or comfortable as the car .
Exept for the big cities the public transport is not an easy way to move trohout the city , that means that in the future even more people will stop using it .
In these diagrams below , the manufacturing process of bank notes is shown clearly .
The first step , the bank notes should be desinged concidering some constructions , like background color , artwork and security issues , After it was prepared , skilled machinists would make preparaation of metal plates in the second step .
Then , sheets of bank notes would be printed by 50 bank notes per sheet , which have colour imagines on both sides in special ink .
After printing well , these sheets would be manually inspected closely .
It was the most important step during the whole processing .
And then , some sheets and good bank notes from damaged sheets which would be cut into and separated into equal ones andpacked and depatched to where they are demanded .
Another ones which were bad sheets and bad bank notes from damaged apparently , would be destroyed securely .
This was the whole working process of the bank notes and it was consist of 7 steps .
The sport is one of the best forms to be healthy and make some exercise .
You can play it with your friends and have a good time .
The most healthy sports are swimming , playing basketball , playing football or running but I prefer to play tennis .
My favourite sport is playing tennis .
I play it three times a week ( on Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays ) in the club of tui .
I had been playing tennis from 2 years ago with two of my best friends .
I enjoy playing tennis because it is a sport that requires skills , concentration and speed .
I am not very good at all but I like to play it with my friends and do matches on Saturdays .
For new tennis players I recommend to know how to hold the racket , the position to hit the ball and how to put your feet .
They will have to concentrate on game and enjoy it .
In today 's class , we were discussing about wheather or not we agree to the common enourmous payed salaries of fooball Players .
For me , as a passionated Soccer Player , it is a good Point to consider .
I recommand to the Clubs , be warned .
For instance Christiano Ronaldo .
For him , as one of the top sheld payed Players of european leagues , it is no big deal to buy a Mercedes Benz .
He is arrogant .
He does not Need another one , but he likes the colour .
This way of thining he also Shows in game time .
He is not chasing after the ball , is not fighting enough to Keep it In the case he would really Need the Money , he would behave totally different .
What influences does this salaries have on the Clubs is quite simple .
They sell the tricots for 20 Euros more per Piece than last season .
By this aciton a Ronaldo or messie can be payed and it is possible to buy the best Team fo the league , like Bayern Munich is doing at the Moment .
But consider the reaction of the fans .
For them it is not possible anymore to rule for their Teams at any home game .
The tickets are to expensive .
The Anger will spoil over someday .
This makes Football or Soccer ever more equisite to a certain Group of fans - Hooligans .
As a result of These Action , it is an uncertain way to go for the Clubs .
If it stays on a certain Lever , no fan will complain about higher Prices .
But if the Prices will be to high , no onw would visit the games anymore .
The aim is to find a balanced way .
Business in My Home Country
In my home country , there are many different kinds of business culture and custom .
For example , restaurant business and technology industry is totally different in Taiwan .
In these 10 years , Taiwanese have become enjoy our life , so many people like to drink coffee or have an afternoon tea .
That is why many business men want to win in this competition , so they created so many bargain activities , like if you check into places , you will buy one get one free .
Apparently , restaurant business is creative and marketing - orientation in Taiwan .
In contrast , there are two different type of company in the technology industry .
One is original equipment manufacturer , like Foxconn , workers in the company always need to do the same thing and the executive in Foxconn also always need to bargain with Apple or Samsung .
Although they produce high quality products they receive a little money and have high pressure in work .
The other one is original brand manufacturer , like htc , they produce a lot of new smartphones and sell it .
In three to four years ago , htc makes so much money in the Europe , Taiwan and Japan .
The company likes to produce new products and use high salary to hire great talents .
So htc became more energetic and bold in making innovation .
In Taiwan , many young people want to enter htc .
Finally , Taiwan still suffers economic slump , but we have so many businesses likes to innovate , market their product , customers likes to buy it .
I think Taiwan will be recovery in the near future .
One evening , it was a blistering hot day that I still should attended , one of my friends , a wedding ceremony .
I was dressed in nice suit , going to this party .
There were so many people talking to each other .
I did n't want to chat with them first .
Consequently , I drank the alcohol on the table , looking for , my friend , a bride .
I wanted to know how beautiful the woman was .
As soon as the bride appeared in front of us , most people kept silent abruptly .
I glanced at the groom jealously .
How lucky he could marry her .
I maintain a good - looking face , keeping fit .
It was ridiculous that I did n't have a girlfriend .
I prefer having a nice gorgeous girl live with me to living alone .
However , I still did n't have a girlfriend .
I was overwhelmed with grief .
I could not stand looking at them , celebrating .
Accordingly , I drifted to the party , going home alone .
However , I was too dizzy to go straight so that I took a ride .
I fell asleep immediately .
The driver set me to a place where he know .
When I woke up , not doing know why I stayed the police office .
Dear Mrs Kate Asbhy ,
I 'm Patricia Agüero , I have seen the advertisement for work in your cafe and I 'm very interested , because I need work to pay my study .
First I think that this job is perfect for me because I have travelled around the world and I know a lot of kinds of food , in fact in my last trip to Japan I learned to cook shushi .
In addition I love dealing with people , I 'm very sociable .
On the other hand I 'm used to work long hours as a matter of fact in holidays I had worked in many restaurants .
I hope your answer soon .
Best wishes
Patricia
one day Micheal wanted to go out from his home so he called his besfriend an suggested to go out togther , his friend agreed , so Michael weared his closes , wnet out and closed the door but at this moment he knew he had made a mistake .
he forgot the key inside the home !
what should he do ?
hw went to his father in the company and get the another copy of the house key .
when he get back to the home it was late and the metting was canceled
It is very true .
There is no future for public transport .
But not so many people have a driver license .
They have to use public transport .
The public transport can connect people .
You can meet every kind of people .
It 's some kind of socializing .
The public transport is cheaper than the car .
hello , my name is victor and I am going to talk to you about myself .
I know that I am a suitable person for this job , and I can say that nobody is better than me for this incredible job , because I have been travelled for all the world and in this experience , I have seen in the necesity on work to fiance my journey , so the I have dedicated to work on summer camps , and I have a lot of experience in this .
I have other qualities like , cooking like super chef or even better than that , I am the person more organizated in this country , and I love to work with children because it is a form to teach everything you know to other people and help to improve like person .
I always do exercise , in the morning I like to running on the beach , at the evening I like to go to the gym and at night I love to swim in my own swimming pool .
so in conclusion , I think that if you contract you , you will get an axcellent people and an excellent worker
I think it is true that the public transport there is not future , because travelling by car is so much more comfortable .
In my opinion the public trasnport is more expensive and it is less comfortable that the car , because the car is faster that the public transport .
The public transport do stop more time that the car , this transport go direct to its destination .
Today the people use the application " blah blah car " .
it is an application that the people use for save gas and money .
I believe that the people in a future they will begin to travelling shared car more time and they use less the public transport as the train , the bus , underground , etc .
The problem that I saw with this , It is that in the future will be more pollution , because there will be many cars .
Online Lerning
Positiv things about the online lernign are dat you are more mobile with your smartphone and you do nt have to carry so much paper with you , also your on your own and in your own lerning speed what makes it more spesific on the user it selfs . maybe your more confortable on your Smartphone then with papers .
Negaticvs about the online lerning are dat your not listening to much from ea real person and more from a Computer , if you do nt have any listening things in the app you do nt lern how to pronounce the words . in my personal obinionits better to lern froma teacher not only dat you lern to pronounce the words correctly you also lern from a personwhat is in my opinion way better i thin k we spend enougth time on smart phones so i do nt think its the best if we use them to lern as well .
For words i think its perfect but all the grammer and talking i think you need a teacher .
I love Grey 's Anatomy , this is supposed to be a medical drama , but I am sure this show has been beloved because of the soap opera drama parts .
Therefore , I would like to highly state that Grey 's Anatomy is my favorite soap opera .
The show seems difficult , the characters always have to face the situations which is uneasy to solve , but practically , this show is a soap opera in hospital .
I used to think I never liked soap opera , because it was boring , out of date and unworthy to watch , but this was just prejudice .
My mother also like this show .
Today 's television is really good .
It shows you movies , news and the new products .
The advertisements are a bit tricky because they know exactly when children watch , for example sfter School .
And then they just show products specially for children .
So at a Special time is a special advertisement for this age group .
But it also shows the new products .
Advertisement is important for the economy .
Exept some good movies they also show a lot of rubbish .
Or sometimes you see during the day horror movies which should not be .
Who wants that their child sees this ?
Of course you can make a child lock on the TV but when you look hard enough for some you will find any .
Every day they show the news .
So you know what is going on in the world .
I think they show it four times a day .
I would say if you know how and when to use a TV it is good but specially for young people who think it is a good entertainment to watch the whole day .
The TV people know what to play that the children get addicted to the TV .
Attitude about schools in Colombia and Australia .
The attitude of Colombians about the educations system is disappointing in some areas and optimistic in others .
In the same way Australians have a different attitude about their education system .
However the attitude of the Colombian and Australian people is different in many ways .
In Colombian some people have a high attitude about education but there are some others that have a very low attitude .
This is because in Colombia there are a lot of social - economic levels which make people to have a different and divided attitude toward education .
Similarly , Australians have a different attitude about the education system .
This is depending on the believes and the cultures of the people .
This attitude is more based on the backgrounds of the people rather than the system itself .
Today I am very exciting because on Sunday I will go to Bangkok .
I go with my older sister , daddy and mommy .
We will have a good time there .
I will eat tokyo , my favorite dessert .
We enjoy so much .
Recently , there is a growing country whose environment is destroyed by building house , which accour for some debation .
Many would argue that its disadvantages have already dispersed advantages , and many others veto this view .
With the tremendous thriving and growth of both economy and cultural diversity , the need of the resource is increading , which used for building much - needed housing and transport networks .
Apparently , it is a good thing , because it is a significient symbol for the development of a country ; however , on the other hand , doing large - scale building projects may bring a galaxy of probems .
In the first place , the environment is destroyed , because there are some tresses and flowers before buliding the house .
What is worst , the room of the house where some animals lived before , so they lost their houses , which become the houses of people , nevertheless , the earth is not only belonged to the human .
Secondly , building more houses not so much because of living by people , but more because of the economy , which is used for building speculation and the price of the house is too expensive to buy for public person .
For example , some people who have lots of money living in shenzhen earn more money by buying low price and selling high price , although they have house to live .
Also , it is reported that Chinese investors have driven up housing prices in Vancouver by 12% .
Therefore , no longer on the acts go unheeded , and the governments have to deal with these problems . We should forbid the acts by setting certain law .
In a word , the government may appeal in some way , that we should protect the earth rather than only facus on personal profit .
Nowadays people usually use the car all the days , actually for most of the diary things ; despite the fact that there is small amount of people that travel in public transport .
The cars pollute big amounts of carbon dioxide , so that is the result of the grey skies of some cities like Madrid Beijing or New York are grey and this has to change .
Using the public transport is " healthier " than the car for the environment because inside the bus can travel twenty three humans and is only one vehicle , however it would be twenty cars .
Also people think that travel in cars is faster than in public transport and I agree with it because the bus or the underground is always stopping in the different stations , so in this way the car is better .
In my opinion , I will use the public transport , not always but more than the car although you travel slower because I want to save our planet , that the rising generations can live in good conditions .
My favourite sport
I have been playing tennis since I was a teenager and for that reason tennis is my favourite sport .
The main reason by which I like playing tennis is because I can control the amount of exercise that I can do .
Tennis is not a coletive sport .
There are necessary just two players and if you get tired and lose a match no one is going to be responsible but yourself .
That 's why you can control your limits .
Besides , you do not need a lot of people , as on football match for example , to play tennis .
Sometimes it is difficult to join so many fellows to practise a coletive sport .
Undercontrary , on a tennis match you need just one , does n't matter if man or woman .
The exception is in a match of double .
Even that you have to find only three more players in this case .
But , although all these advantages , the tennis player has to take care with some dangerous situations .
For example , never starts a match without a warm up because you can suffer serious muscular injury .
It happened with me once and was very unconfortably .
Another very commom risk is to fall on the square which can cause dangerous scratches .
In despite the risks , I recommend this sport for everyone who has a good physical condition .
Buy a good racket , wear a pair of good shoes , find someone to practise and start to enjoy .

Dear Paul
Last month I helped host a concert in Timisoara .
I was the boy behind the curtain , I dealt with the sound of the concert due to my experience in professional music equipment .
I encountered during the concert small problems but we have fixed very easy thanks to the team with whom I have worked .
Pleasure to work at concerts is when I look in front of the stage and see different classes of people with different ages starting from the young and the elderly who forget all your worries and enjoy the same concert as if not and be separate .
The experience is an unforgettable and I hope that I feel the same soon at the next concert .
Your friend Pogan
When they were together , they knew that his history was about to finish .
They could live with this fact .
People surprised to know his relation was broken for so long .
They seemed happy to share their life .
Never nobody heard any discussion .
They always were so friendly , and so kind ... that was strange image that end But that was the sad reality .
Then had to decide with who would stay their cat .
They met with the layer .
They presented arguments to get the custody and the layer listened them very carefully to decide they can not have the cat .
The cat had to go to the animal residency and they had to pay the expenses .
The meeting ended .
Michael closed the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake
Michael made a very bad mistake ....
There are the most bad mistake that he does in all your life ....
Her mom would kill him !
But first , I will tell you all the story since the beginning .
Michael was a boy very intelligent .
He was the best student in her class .
The boy had a mother .
Mia that was her name .
She always asks to Michael to never disrespect when people are at the door and always be polite .
Mia could n't accept when some behave badly .
And Michael said every time that he never will do that .
But , one day day , Mia think that she could do a test .
She would get dressed as an old woman .
So she said to Michael that she would go shopping and she would return soon .
Then she put her cover of an old woman and took her way home .
Getting there , she knocked on the door .... Michael open the door and Mia ask if he has a cup of water to give him and he says way he would give a cup of water to an old people .
In this moment , Mia took away her cover and Michael sad :
OMG !
These is the most mistake I did in all my life !
The building was initially planned as the Federal Legislative Palace during the regime of Porfirio Díaz , because the society was governed and supported for the president .
In later time , society feel the need for change about iniquities that pass in the country and the Mexican Revolution explotes , the building is abandoned because the government and country do nt have money for construction , to the point the building metal estructure was used as weapons .
After the revolution , construction will use for represented the win of revolution
Almost every family have a car now .
They use these car to travel , for shopping , to drive to work .
It is so much more convenient .
Only in the big city , people use public transport to will not be traffic .
My mother and my father had a fight to each other , they wanted not together .
They even asked me , I wanted to go with who , they grabbed my hands , wanded me go themself , but I had no idea , because I love my mother and my father so much .
I wanted we can live together forever , they taked care of me , loved me , we lived in the same house , we had a happy family .
I thinked these things .
Finally , I cried , because I could n't decide a choice , my father and my mother saw I cry , decided not keep going , and they saied sorry to each other and me .
Hi Peter !
How are you ?
I 'm happy for you !
I agree with your parents , maybe you could spend your money with something you really need and maybe you can buy computer games with the money you have left , or maybe you put aside money to buy something really important to you .
If I were you I wait to spend the money .
Let me know what you decide .
See you soon .
When I was at university student , I wanted to swim well but I could n't swim . because I did n't have to swim in my life .
so I decided to learn swim for summer vacation .
First , I registered a swimming pool then I went back to the swimming pool every day in the early morning .
After 6 months I could swim well until now .
so I satisfied my decision at 13 years ago .
Nowadays I usually went back to the swimming pool in the weekens .
Sometimes I got rid of my stress .
I thoght the swimming was the best of sports in my life because you can use your body muscle everything .
So you could a lose weight and gained muscles .
Some of my friends they did n't want to shown their body by someone . because a lot of students did n't have exercise .
We did n't have to enough time today .
but I always said my friends " If you want to have fit body , you will register swimming pool .
" So many friends learend to swim .
Dear Dana ,
Thank you for sending the AA Report to us .
The report was discussed at our meeting , and we wish to congratulate you on completing this audit and providing the details and evidence on improving the outcomes from students results in this year .
One straight observation was the low number of students that have taken the math course .
We wondered if some work need to be done to increase the student attendance in the math courses .
The diagram gives information about various stages in the process of making bank notes .
It is true that there are five stages in the whole process.we can see that the processes begin with design and end at packaging and distribution .
looking at the information in more detail .
Initially , bank note should be considered the design such as background colour , artwork , and security issues.then,the preparation of metal plates is next stage.bank note should be skilled and machinists.thereafter,this stage is printing .worker should pay attention to colour on both sides , special ink , and images slightly raised .
subsequently , this step is most important.bank note should be inspected.bank notes separated into good and bad if get good quality sheets , the next stage is packaging and distribution.at this stage sheets should be cut into separate bank notes , packed , and dispatched . if get bad sheets.the nest stage is disposal.band sheets and bank notes securely destroyed .
The diagrams show bank notes how to make , there are four steps to make the bank notes .
First , the bank notes are designed by consider , thinking from background colour , artwork , security issues .
Then , the metal plates are preparated by skilled machinists .
And then , the sheets are printed , operator should pay attention to the colour on both sides , special ink , and images slightly raised .
Third , this is the most important step that printed sheets manually inspected , the this sheets are classified three areas .
The number one called good quality sheets , they will be packed and dispatched .
The next called partially damaged shees , and bank notes separaed into good and bad , good sheets will be cutted into separate bank notes and packed , the bad one will be destroyed by fair .
The number three called bad sheets , they will be securely destroyed .
This a method of making bank notes , and the operater should pay attention to the printed sheets how to inspect .
These pictures obviously show us what detailed steps of the bank to produce paper money into the application .
Before the production , they should think about the cover , including background color , artwork and codes which make it different from the illegal ones , then put them into the printing machines to create them .
On the top of the steps is the inspectation by hands , that is to say , they should be separated into well - qualified ones , which are to be cut into bank notes , and delivered to the banks and the bad ones which ca n't be utilited are fired definitely at the last stage .
In a words , the processing of making money to banks is very creative and serious , even rigid .
I know that we can post anything that we want but not like this .
Wake up world .
Look at you .
Rise your nose from your phone , and look at all these nice things that the life is giving us .
Read a book or play football if that is what you like .
We are architects of our own destruction .
We have to live our life .
You ca n't live only on Facebook .
YOLO !
YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE !
I think public transport do n't lost .
for example me , I do n't have a car thus I usually use a train in my school .
I think that is enough .
If I will go travel I think a car is very useful . but Movement of long distance is very tire .
Consequently , you ca n't fun travel .
Children ca n't get a car license thus children use Public transport .
Of course , Do n't have a car license people ca n't drive a car .
Accordingly , I think need public transport .
I think that members of our family ca n't be our best Friends , because maybe we do not have the same confidence that we have in our Friends .
For example , maybe you have a personal situation , that is very important to you , but you do not want your family know about it , so you decide to tell your best friend , because you know she wo n't tell anybody .
I think it depends on the situation , on the other hand , your sister or brother , can be one of your best Friends , you can tell them important things , but ask them not to tell your parents .
I 'm studying Business Administration , I think my major is so busy .
But also when I 'm working on a project which involves business , I feel rewarded .
Actually I realize that busynes is not for the major , everybody know Tec is very demanandant and if you wanna be there you must work hard .
I 'm dreaming to be an Business Administrator when I 'll be older , firstly I want to work an a sports company lik UA and then I may have a little variety on works .
Finally I hope to get my own business .
Family members are the people who will company us in our whole life .
Compare to our classmates or co - workers , the members of our family know us the most .
They know what our habits are , what we think about and what we like to eat .
Family members are the most important and best friends in our life .
First of all , family members are those who will keep in touch forever , so they know our habits the most .
Moreover , they know how to interact with us . They can make you happy , cheer up your mind and always support you when you are in trouble .
Secondly , family members always know what we are thinking about .
Families realize our mind so much ; However , our classmates or companies ca n't reach that because they do n't stay with us all the time .
Only families can know us the most because they live with us when we came to this world .
Final , family members will always prepare the food you like to eat .
They always give you what we like to eat .
In addition , they always supply much food to us so that we wo n't stay hungry .
Besides , eating with our families are one of the most happiness things in our life .
In conclusion , only family members know what we are most deeply .
Also , family members are the people that we will always want to stay in contact forever .
Because of the reasons above , we can say that the members of our family are our best friends !
Tennis , tennis is not jsut a sport anyone can play but it 's professional sport needs to more hard trainee and more time to be perfect in it , in first why I choose tennis ? , seriously in 2003 this is my first time to watch the game on TV when I saw roger federer played I think he is the one that made me love this sport , due to it 's professional motion in playing the ball , from this time I was interested in this game and watching all championship , so more time , time and time it was my favoirite sport .
my advice is be patient , be smart this sport not easy but it 's need more trainee , more time to be one of the greatest player in the game
MY BEST FRIEND
I met my best friend , Aisha , at a friend 's in common party six years ago , when we were 25 .
While I was dancing she pushed my by accident , she did n't noticed it so I thought she was an arrogant person at first .
But , when our friend in common introduce her to me I realized that she was a funny and nice person .
Aisha is a funny girl , she is always making jokes , and she really knows how to have fun .
Her parties are always the best .
She loves dancing and she is really a party animal .
She is also a good listener , she always know what to say in a bad moment and she is always there when a friend is in trouble .
Aisha is in his therties .
She 's from Marocco , so she has Arabian features , for example , she is n't very tall , around 1,57 metres , she has long dark wavy hair and black expresives big eyes .
She is tanned and has a slim complexion .
Dear Redaction ,
I have just read , that you need reviews of soaps opera .
I have one favourite soap opera .
This is a ' Beverly Hills 90210 ' .
I love this film , because it shows teenagers life .
And I like see how they look like .
I like their style and live .
They learn at school , they have problems with each other , they fall in love , have parties .
Most of all I like Brenda , because she is a smart , beautiful person .
And she wears the best clothes ever !
I would like to be like she .
I think that a lot of people can learn how to live , what think , eat , wear from this soap opera .
My best friend is my sister .
Although I have 5 members of my family but just one from 5 is my real friend .
She did a lot for me , my life
.
In my opinion , that is not a logical statement which jibes with the fact .
First of all , although travelling by car become more convenient , the growing population which cause personal vehicle is hard to manage .
The traffic jam becomes more and more serious as far .
Such as Beijing , the metropolis in China , faces the salient bad traffic as such government had to encourage the citizen go to work by public transport such as bus and subway .
Apparently , this method has made a great contribution to the traffic in Beijing .
So , the public transport is playing an important role in our daily life , It shows an indispensable effects on the society work .

Introduction
The aim of this report is to inform the committee about the attractions of this town .
The report is based on the opinions and ranking of people and critics that have been visiting these places .
Town center
In the town center there are most attractions as well as one of the best bars in the region " the Albastirca " .
Many visitors come to it but there are more attractions than only one bar .
There is a giant park which maybe the visitors would be delighted to visit as it has animals , a funfair and a lake .
Pluses
What 's more about the town is that it is n't lacking shopping facilities .
It has a big mall that has been recently opened up , and it contains everything the visitors might need .
On the other the mall lacks a cinema or some restaurants as it has been recently opened .
Conclusions
To sum it up I strongly suggest that the visitors stay as much as possible in this town as it has almost everything that a man needs .
Some people say there is no future for public transportation but I do n't think so .
People who believe it do n't care about air pollution and traffic .
Lima is a small city where there is no more space for another car .
Moreover , it is more approppiate to start constructing roads which were convenience for the majority .
first my favorite sport is futboll and i like for many reasons for example while you are watching a match you 're going to feel exited and entretaining besides that fubol has the best fotboll player than ever who is leo mesy he 's the best and he s able to awesome stuff when he 's playing .
Yesterday morning a group of American tourist went to a bike ride for through the center of Buenos Aires City .
One of them was intercepted by a man on a motorcycle , he seemed to have 28 year .
The mas was armed try to steal the backpack .
But he not be fixed that the man was a camera in his head and hi action was filmed .
He was furious because the American do n't understand what he would say .
The tourist was surprised to see a gun , the robber forced the man in the street and then the tourist put to run .
He was very lucky because the gunman returned to pick up his motorbike and keep his gun .
The man run to where his friends and sought a police .
They found a police near it and made the complaint , the group continued the bike ride and returned their hotel totally scared .
After two days and with the help of the filming the gunman was captured and brought to justice .
Now he was arrested and charged before a magistrate for the robbery , waiting for his sentence .
The tourists return to his country very scared .
How can I start ? should i start with speaking about myself or about my country or about my family or about my life ?
It is hard for an eastern girl to do what she likes because of her society 's traditions and customs .
Let 's take me as an example , I am a 25 years old girl who is graduated from faculty of engineering and want to travel to Germany to complete my study but I am not able to do this because my family will not allow me to travel alone .
I am trying to change my family 's opinion so that I can travel .
College is the only place where i feel I am special that is why i always like to there .
How we treat the earth has a direct impact on ourselves .
Today , because of our progress of industry , we produced so many environmental problems that had n't appeared before .
For examples , lack of purity water , shortage of electricity , climate change , natural source depletion , and etc .
The problems were n't so significant that we overlooked them , but now they become serious threats that we ca n't ignore .
How can we solve these problems ?
Just change your daily habits .
There are so many questions .
Who we are ?
What do we do ?
Why we make mistakes ?
There is no clear answer but the sure thing is we are humans .
As a nature of human , we would make mistakes .
But we should n't make same mistakes .
If you wrong , I will fix you and if I wrong , please fix me .
Anyway , we would make mistakes , if we do the new challenges and new tasks .
We have to fix it all again .
Introducion :
The aim of this report , is to show how does my town takes care of the environment .
Home rubbish :
The mayor , in collaboration with Lipor , distributed leaflets with information on " How to deal with household rubbish " .Each leaflet explains how to separate the home rubbish .
Instead of putting the rubbish in one trashcan , the families should separate it in three different groups - papers , glasses and plastics - and put it into the correct eco point .
The company responsible for rubbish collection collects of the garbage , already separated by the families , and afterwards does the recicling .
How does the town treats the environment :
The City Hall is very concerned in keeping the area cleaned .
In spite of the informative sessions about the enviorenment , organized by the Mayor for all of the residentes , it also has lots of staff that cleans the streets , take care of the city gardens and collect the garbage .
Eco friendly :
In conclusion , I would like to say that the city where I live maintaines the city cleaned and attractive , for people that live there and for those who visit the city .
I do believe that the members of my family are my best friends for many reasons.first of all , we got the same education as we grew together we know each other .
If I suffer from any problem the first step I do is I try to go back to my lovely sister because deep inside I know she is only member that can assist me .
Secondly , if I need money I will come back to my brother or sister I ask them to borrow some money .
I think public transport has good prospect in the future according on following reasons .
First , the trend of environmentally friendly has grown since the shortage awareness of fuel , taking public transport can decrease the air pollution by car , and more governments had build the public transport system including subway , buses etc .
The transport in the city is n't inconvenient as years ago .
The other is , travelling by car is n't convenient if you go to the famous resorts , most famous resorts lack of parking lots , travelers may spend hours to park .
On the contary , people who take the public transport can more enjoy the travel because they do n't waste vitality on driving .
To summarize , because the development of public transport is more and more complete , the advantage of travelling by car was placed by public transport gradually , the future of the public transport is bright .
My favourite sport is football .
It gives me many a positive energy and fun .
I have played for 12 years .
I am not a professional player .
I play just for yourself
Sometimes If I would like to play football but it rains I can watch football on television .
If I play with my best friends at football I will be a goalkeeper .
In football my favourite position is goalkeeper .
It is really hard to give some advice .
We have to be very patient .
My advice is only one .
If you practise you will achieve skills .
In Somalia , people usually throw the rubbish and garbage in everywhere , and there is no a cycle which intended to keep it .
The city council are tackling with how they can keep the city clean , and each and every morning there are employees whose work are to collect and keep the environment clean .
Many of the main roads of Mogadishu are getting attractive by the day and the people begun to make their city clean .
Swimming is my favorite sport , I usually swim 2 or 3 time a week , swimming is a good sport especially in summer .
Study says the cool water will cool the body temperature down and that means it will burn the body fat fast then the other sport .
The other advantage of the swim is the less impact the knee .
Swimming will be the good exercise to the people who are not able to jog or even walk .
By the way , some people do n't like to swim because they have difficulty finding the swimming pool , I think that just an excuse to be lazy , the Internet will help you to find out .Lets go to swim .
FOOTBALL_MY FAVORITE SPORT
Nowadays , there are many choices to spend in our free time such as go shopping , travelling , listen to music , reading , etc ..
But to me , I choose playing sport in my free time .
Football - the most popular sport in the world , is well - known as " King Sport " .
There are two teams and each team has the same amount of players : maybe 6 , maybe 7 and maximum 11 .
The objective of the game is to score by kicking the ball into the opposing goal .
Actually , I began to play football when I was 10 years old .
I play football in my free time until now .
There are many reasons why I enjoy football .
My first idea , football make us stay in shape , avoid some diseases .
A second idea , It helps us make new friends when I take part in some football team .
I have relationship with people who are playing football with me .
They not only help me in every match but also share me everything in daily life .
A finally idea , football makes us enjoy our life and increase quality of life so far after working hours .
Eating a balanced diet is something very important for anyone especially for pregnant women , children and old people as their bodies need more nutrition than younger people .
Although balanced diet will offer energy and vitality but that 's not all of the thing , Exercising is important too in addition to the balanced diet .
My favourit sport is football i love it so much when i was young i used to watch football and my favorite team is Barcelona i was play with my friends at the street and we was happy with that so much and after that we played at playground like really football i love Cristiano Ronaldo so much he is the best player at the world a few people telling me that messi is the best player but i feel angry when i hear that because that is not true so i looking forward to meet my best player one day its like a dream to me .
I think the alcohol is the most dangerous addiction all around the world .
Because many people have died for this , and it 's really hard to stop this addiction even if the person wants to stop it .
my favorite sport is swimming
i swim 2 times per a week
sometimes i go to the swimming pool in the same area which i work there and sometimes i go to the swimming pool of my cousin ,
i enjoy when i spend my time in the water and now even i am pregnant i am afraid when i swim with a group of people i keep telling them and screaming do not close with me ! ! !
hhhh sometimes is funny
but my husband he takes cars of me he does n't allow to anyone to be much closer with me ,
my mother in law she likes swimming too
last night we went to the swimming pool it was a little bit cold but we liked so we went to the pool and srated to swimming i know how to swim very well but she does n't she has to have a support otherwise she ca nt .

If you want to visit a restaurant , I would suggest the Dagi .
It is a bit far from my home , behind the fuel station once we left your car .
To answer your question , I can not attend the party beacuse I do not like theese kind of parties , but I wish you good luck!Almos

Thank you .
When it comes to public transport , the future is relatively dark according to the prospection .
Indeed all the indicators show that humain behavior will not change at least in the following decades .
Car continues to attract people .
In the other hand , Governments are not able to change transportation policies to enhance public transport level of service .
Malaga is a town that takes care of the environment .
Around the city , there are a lot of containers for rubbish , pieces , plastic and crystal .
All people has very close someone to recycle .
Also , you can put clothes and shoes that you do n't need it for Africa children .
So , Malaga is responsible with the environment and with people with more necessities .
Secondly , in Malaga there are strong and hard rules for factories .
These companies must take care of the environment or they would have to pay big tax at the council .
So , in general , I think Malaga is very responsible with the environment and acts in consequence .
The way of livng change everyday : if we think about our grandparents ' , but also about our parents ' life , we notice many differences .
Above all they talked more : we live in the era of the telecomunication and none could live without their mobile phone or their computer .
Be always in contact with our friends has become our way of living .
Moreover also simple things are changed , for example the food we eat : some times ago everythingh was natural , healthy ... but now everyone eat always " junk food " and thinghs like that , which are completely unhealthy !
However , How will people 's life change in the next 50 years ?
As a result of what I have just said , in my opinion people wo n't have a " really life " : everyone will be always more involved in the virtual life so that they will forget how to talk each other and how express own feelings !
About the foods , I imagine a future society in which restaurant wo n't exist : people will eat only junk foods and food , which has been prepared before , food in tin ... so all unhealthy thinghs , which will cause many problems .
For this reason I also imagine that in the future doctors and scientists will have so much to do !
Do not ruin our life , it could be all so perfect !
My favourite sport is soccer .
Also , we can learn to help each other in the team .
My favourite trick is nutmeg .
My favourite soccer player is Frank Lampard .
My favourite team is Chelsea FC .
My favourite soccer pitch is Hong Kong Stadium .
My favourite soccer is the Brazuca .
I started soccer when I was four .
I often play soccer with my father and my brother .
When it is holiday , my brother and I play soccer twice a week .
It is really good to play soccer !
Everyone is afraid of something .
A lot of people are afraid of catastrophic events even thought it 's very improbable that the same thing will happen to us .
Some fear are instinctive and it 's positive because it protect us from real danger , it 's a good response .
But the phobias are which we experience that are life - threatening and they can distrupt everyday life , but people can get over with the right sort of therapy .
So if we want to live a life which is n't controlled by our fears , we must try to be more objective and pay mre attention to the real dangers .
We should spend less time worrying and more time being happy !
In 1898 , H.G. Wells wrote his story ( the war of the worlds ) , so it was inevitable ; people began to see space creatures everywhere .
Science fiction magazines and stories spread .
And the flying saucers ' culture has dominated . They will be green in color .
They will have three eyes , antennas over their heads , and guns firing green extraction .
They want to occupy the planet Earth because , according to them , our resources are still virgin ..

Alison left the house very scared , it was a dream .
Nowadays , public transport is used for many people in the cities , we can find different types of them , such as bus
tube and train , but is there a future for it or not ? , I am going to respond this question giving disadvantanges and advantages and finally I give my personal opinion .
To begin with , Public transports is not as comfortable as using our own vehicle , every day , about all in the morning , it is usually crowded , due to people than begin to work .
Secondly , moving in a city in public transport could be horrible , there are too many station , and we spend a lot of time on them until we arrived at home .
Although I have written some disadvantages , public transport is better than private .
Firstly , if anyone want to move in the city using the car , that could be very expensive , due to traffic jam .
Secondly , Public transport is more ecological and less polluted with the enviromment , so as it is producing less polluted fume , and many of them use green energy , such as electricity or gas .
In conclusion , from my point of view , public transport is more necessary now than never before , cities contains more automoviles and the pollution is worse , we need to change our mind , and try to use them as other alternative to improve the enviromment of our cities .
Last week , my class and I went to Sicily for a schooltrip .
we visited many cities .
the first day we went to Taormina and Giardini Naxos , the day after we visited Siracusa , the third day Agrigento and The valley of the temples and the last day we saw Marsala and Trapani .
I enjoyed all the cities we saw but the best in my opinion is Siracusa . in particoular I liked Ortigia that is the oldest part of the city .
I also liked the Valley of the temples of Agrigento so much : it was amazing .
I think that the worst thing of the trip is that the last night in our room there were a lot of insects and some spiders and we must change Room .
public transport now a days has become a bit uncomfortable because we can not think of availability of seat .
large number of people use it which results in over - loaded buses and trains .
it take too much time to travel by public transport than by personal vehicle.there is scarcity of buses in public transport and there timings too are not fixed .
traveling by car or any other personal vehicle is too much more convenient because it takes too much less time and it takes us directly to the place where we want to go .
In a recent time privet transport is more convenient than public transportation , although public transport like buses , train , ferries and intercity rail are consuming less time and energy but sometimes its create problems .
In public transport people bound to share transport means with strangers and also we have to persue company policy or regulations , but with their own transport we do n't have to bother about these things we travel when we want and when we have time .
We do n't have to book tickets in private transport .
So we can say that travelling in their own transportation is more comfortable .
People had drived car to go a work .
The city have a lot traffic .
They prefer to go work car than bus .
Public transport is very cheap then car and reduce traffic in the city .
It 's true drive by car is so much more convenient , because people do n't need to wait bus .
They can drive any hour , they can to go and to come any moment .
They can travel another place , independent the hour .
Bus , boat and train are public transport most used for people .
Some cities there are n't boat , because do n't have river or sea .
It 's comum in city the bus .
Some bus have special and preferencial sit to old people .
This is interesting because people are practice solidary .
I think could have a lot bus in city .
Many car is poluent for planet and is alergic to people .
The train do n't have poluition .
This transport is better to population and do n't have traffic in city .
Another idea is ride a bicycle and to walk street .
This can help heauthy the people and city will stay most clean .
So we must reduce by car on street .
We will be very happy and we .
will be more heauthy .
My favourite sports walk , I really like this sport for several reasons :
1- It 's very common I can do it anywhere and anytime I want .
2- It 's very cheap , I will not buy anything to do .
3- It 's not hard sport , in all cases I will not be tired after walking .
4- It makes me relax because I stop doing my activity from work and study .
5- It gives me big time to think on all my life without any distributions from anybody .
cause all these reasons walking is my favourite sport .
From few years , people use different types of transport . We ride by bus or by car .
We fly at plane or something other .
The travelling by car is more convenient in my opinion .
Firstly , you save money if you use a car .
When you ride by bus , you pay more .
Moreover you travel with the other people .
You stay in queue for buy a ticket .
Secondly , you should feel uncomfortable .
At some means of transport is too crowded and you haven ' t got a place to stay .
sometimes you lie on a window .
It is n't good .
Finally , if you ride a car you musnt care about timetable . You can go at every hour .
When you go by bus for example , you must wait at cold bus station .
I hate this .
At sum up , in my opinion travelling by car is better .
You have comfort , you feel better .
You do n't have to worry that you do n't arrive in time .
Unfortunately , is very sad to say that people in my town does not care about the environment .
We need to start doing something to avoid contamination .
There are so many little things we could do to care for the environment .
So many storms , and all the things happening around the world are the result of not taking care of the only planet we have to live .
I suppose their lifstile intolerable , resteless and I really sympothise with them Magotity of outstanding and appreciated people are frustrated .
They turn into arrogant and furious idols because of shortage of ptivate lifetime perpetual attention .
That is a pitiless trial for celebrities bit through thick and thin they go on .They archieve the goals made exceptionally in sake of money and vanity .
I realised it is not worth it .
Thank you for your care .
There is one thing confuse me that is the old extension number .
I always answer some wrong calls and these calls distract me .
I receive many calls looking for the previous worker and I need to spend my time to explain what happened to him .
May I have a new extension number ?
Thanks for your help .
Dear Jo ,
Romania is a beautiful country and has many jobs .
Also there are many places to see , mountains , lakes where you can relax and have fun .
The jobs are nice and you can work for three months .
There is good pay also .
I also work in summer as a waitress in a terrace .
It is good and people are nice .

Hi ,
I hope you are well .
I 'm writing you a letter because I was made a short film with my friends , and I want to tell you what is the film about and how was the experience .
The idea of make a film comes up a Saturday night at a meeting of friends .
At first we thought that the idea was just a joke , but Jake , one of my friends , said that he had carried a video camera .
When Jake said that , we start roar with laughter , but then , another friend offered the idea to do a home film .
The experience about the film was amazing , because we laugh all night and we enjoyed that very cool idea .
In itself , the film did n't have an especially topic , but I can describe it like friend 's film as appears lot of laughts , jokes , and it reflected that friendship is the greatest thing that exists .
By the way , I 'm sending the film together with this letter .
Let me know about you and your life .
Hope to hear from you soon ,
Bianca
Running is my therapy .
I started running to lose weight and ended in a life changing experience .
Some may say that running is very similar to religion , but to me is more than that .
Running connects me to my inner Goddess .
Running is cheap and everyone can take up running , no experience required after all it is just one step after the other .
In My country Bus 's car is the essential public transport .
So I got a lot troubles :
1 . Everyone spends much times to travel .
2 . Bus car 's driver does n't care people who around him .
That means he is a careless , who always drives too fast
But public transport has advantages : If we uses it is the essential transport to travel .
Therefore environment will be improved .
Maybe traffic 's accident is decreased
I am writing to report on the local transport of Toluca .
The public transport most used in Toluca is el bus because it is the most cheaper , but it is very bad and unsafe , the qualiti of it is very bad , the buses are old and obsolete these have broken windows and old and broken seats .
The service is very bad the drivers are very angry and stressed out these do not lead with cauition , in Toluca exist report of high rates of accidents by buses .
The public transport is unsafe because growth the theft and kidnapping express to users .
I suggest changing the old buses by new buses and put security cameras in the buses .
That the cameras transmitted immediately the image of the robbers at other buses to ensure that they are alert , and that the drivers receive training and sanctions by conduct bad .
I think we live very quick , always running , we do n't enjoy our lives .
Because we want a lot of money , a lot of things ... we are always working for giving more money , we do n't meet our neighbour for example .
Maybe in the future will be worse .
There is is no future for public transport because car has made life so easy .
It 's economically and practically is more expensive .
People
Prefer to use cars instead of public transport .
It 's saves time .
In old times luxuries were not considered as compare to Heslth but now every one prefer to save time and maintain privacy which one can only afford by using her / his private transport so gradually public transport losing its charm .
public transport
I think it 's very important as it reduce the problem of both pollution and population we use few transport as it is big and carry a lot of people .
underground , trains and buses these means of transport are cheap so it helps the poor to save some money .
governments should take care of public transport they should save means of entertainment peoples should keep them clean and safe if they use it carelessly it will be useless Now There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
cars are faster than public transport so cars are more convenient than public transport it is easier , faster and more comfortable especially in long distances so governments should improve public transport as not all people have cars
Now a day 's travelling became easier for the humans to move all over the world .
Many of the people habituated to use their own vehicle as their transport , where they can reach their destination in time .
In the following paragraphs , I present my view in this controversial issue .
firstly , We are having different modes of transport facilities , which among is road transport .
As Automotive Industries are huge in market , most of the house holders prefer to buy a car rather than any other motor vehicle .They can have easy move from source to destination with in no time .
And there need not to be depend on the public transport of their journey .
As private transport is increasing day by day , it 's surprises that there may not be any public transport in up coming days .
Secondly , if the private transportation is growing faster , the traffic is also going to create a major problem , which effects the global warming .
And the income that is getting through this servicing transport will automatically dropdown , which create a problem to the economy of the government .
Another issue we can see here is unemployment .
Most illiterate people choose their proficiency as public transportations like , bus service , cab service , auto service .... etc , in order to full fill their basic needs .
People with more unemployment may also lead to a crime rate .
I hope , giving equal priority for both public and private transportation makes healthy .
And we can see that controlling traffic is not going out of the hands .
In all times and places there is always some typical food of the country where we live .
My name is Laura and I live in Argentina .
Here , in this country there are typical dishes , desserts , drinks .
Some of them are , roast , mate and some others , but those are the best known .
On the one hand , I like to have things typical in each country , apart from they are delicious , because when you 've got the opportunity to travel , you can go and experience with the food too .
On the other hand , the bad thing about when there are so delicious food , it 's that always you want to eat some typical food of your country and at the end it 's very bad for the body because we eat them in excess .
In ten years , they did n't change that things , because they are delicious and no one would like to eat anything other than roast !
i think if the goverment do the best work about the transport , they can save it .
the public transport is the best way to save the planet and have a best atmosphere ; also we safe money and can meet people .
it is true the car is more confortable , but it uses a lot of mineral recurses like petrol wich can contaminate the ambient .
i do nt think the public transport does not have future , there are a lot of people who can not buy a car and has to use the communite transport .
Public transport is very much complicated now a days .
Place like Mumbai is full of People and no place to park the vehicles .
Day by day people are increasing in Mumbai .
Crowd is more and all the people want to travel by public transport so it is difficult to travel . Best way to travel in there

Is the Internet the greatest invention of all time ?
Internet is a useful means for everyone , so we are getting on with distant friend , and we look for important information when we are studying or entretainament themself .
First of all , I am going to talk about adavantages and disadvantages for this topic .
First adavantage , is Interent too much quick , for example when you want information about something .
Second advantage is Internet by website , such as twiter , facebook ... You allow speak with your quick friend , or you can meet ith them by website , therefore you do not call by telephone , so internet is too much cheap .
According to disadvantanges , at present , childs are aways playing with his computer games and mobile phone .
Both computer game and mobilephone have got internet , as a result , they have not got time the another traditional games .
Other disadvantages is that , people do not meet with friends , since they speak by website Internet , so every time there is unless relationship , the people is not sociable .
To sum up Internet is an progress more important in the world , but too there are a lot disadavantages and advantages .
In my point of view , Internet is useful for everyone , but we should not abuse , so carring out another activities .
Good Thriller was not my favorite type of gender until I saw ' No Escape ' .
This movie is about what happens in the real life right now , on the other side of the world .
They persecute an American family that went because of the dad 's job , which was something about a company that the natives from that place hated most .
Without expecting it at all , this family went somewhere over Asia to start a new way of living .
In other words , they had to get use to a different kind of world .
It was n't that easy for the couple with two little girls .
They had to escape with the doors from the country closed , while making sure both girls did n't get their minds full of junk ( people killing ) .
And in some of the scenes the little girl escaped or the dad had to make them jump from a building to another one !
Anyways , I would n't want to ruin the ending but I would definitely recommend you to see what happens next !
Helen , I did n't expect this .
It was a huge surprise for me !
I really appreciate your card that you sent me .
It made me speechless !
I have never got anything like this .

Dear Principal of the Effective Learning School
I am interested in your advertisement you post in an English language magazine .
Recently I have got a job offer from a company located in London and it requires me ILETs score 6.5 for visa .
I have studied this exam not at all and I have got a very limited time , around 3months , before the last test so I would like to begin as soon as possible .
I am working daytime so night time , 6 pm to 9 pm , or anytime on weekends would be good for me except on Mondays and Wednesdays when I play basketball as a hobby .
Also I am thinking of studying with you for 2months but we can talk more about this later .
I am good at speaking and listening sections but not confident at writing , especially essay I 've never learnt in my life so I want to focus on this writhing part more than others .
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon .

Travelling by car is much more convenient but all know really there is no future for public transport .
When we talk about public transport , there are many people and everyone travel but i think we do not feel relax are there and if we talk about travelling by car .
It is the best or much more convenient for us .
Because we can travel any where but in public transport we can not travel to any other sites
I think there is a big future for public transport , because a lot of people want to take that and more than anything else that is convenience .
Especially some people do n't have a car and some elderly persons difficult to driving a car by themselves , so the public transport helpeing them a lot .
Already public transport have been improvement and that makes comfortable to go on a trip , but I think that will be able to become good quality more and more , because so many people expectation .
I like a car as well , but when I have to driving a car I have to think about parking a lot and I ca n't enjoy meeting other people to talk while I am having travel , so the public transport is making connection with human beings .
It is why I think public transport is really important for public and there are a lot of important thing is having a possble in the future .
Every Human has points of strength and weakness .
So , the Humans including women and men should behave according to these points .
The question which is rising now should the employer hire women in some posts and excludes them from another , and so that for men .
There are two answer to this question , the first one is to who sees that it is right to exclude women from some jobs .
For example , the builder needs physical strength to carry cements and bricks .
The mechanic should have the ability to afford drawbacks of the job .
The second answer is it is not correct to exclude men or women from any posts .
The explanation of those who support the second answer is every one had borne equal in duties and rights .
So there is no one can hire someone or give anyone a job according to gender .
Is convenient take a year off between leaving school and starting the university ?
I think it is not necessary and not recommendable because you have the possibility to earn money and is difficult once you get used to earn money , you want to study again .
Also , if you want to travel , you have to make money for that and then , travel .
Furthermore you do n't study during this period and when you want to start the university you would n't be able to remember some important things
So , if you take a year off , you have to think about it .
People use public transport because of saving money .
But now they are earning more money than they earned before .
Therefore , it is likely to imminent that public transport will no longer exist in future .
think has a future that all people use public transport then I think that maybe continue to have future but has bad and good things , for example good is easier to move in the city and you save time , and the bad , bad people attack you and steal things , but I thing , that have future , because a lot people even they use public transport to .
the people use the public transport also the people needs to move for all the city .
what I ' m saying is that if you have future public transport that people use so much that you will have future
Convenience is not the only one consideration when we are travelling .
A lot of people choice public transport for travelling because it 's cheaper , easier , more relaxed and sometimes faster than driving a car .
In recent years , governments encourage people to take public transport because of fuel crisis .
Some of governments invest much money to construct public transport network to make travelling by public transport more convenient .
When driving a car , we will face a parking space trouble in a city .
Besides , a traffic jam is another problem .
So , I do n't think there is no future for public transport .
My mother is my inky best friends in my family , she always listening to me , sometimes i call her with her real name!.
She always tell me some jokes but some times i laughed !
, i love her so much , i do n't know how will my world being like without her and i wo n't to know .
I pray everyday to save my mother and all my family to me .
My name is Tom , I 'm 12 years old .
I have a black skin , black hair .
I 'm short .
I am wearing a shirt , and a pair of trousers .
I will wait for you at the train station
Well , there 're a lot of sport that people practise every day but I have one which is my favourite .
It 's basketball .
This sport have a lot of type of match which you can play .
You can play with your friends or in a team even alone but this option is the most boring .
Basketball is a perfect sport because you can develop your reflections and your ships with people .
I enjoy playing basketball because I relax when I play it and I can meet new people and travel around your city or your country . That it 's the best because you can visit the cities ...
And you enjoy between your mates and live all those special moments with them .
I can give you some advice to start practising this sport .
This 's a sport that improve your friendships and it 's so good for your health .
And maybe you became a famous player or a simple player but you feel like a famuos .
But it is important to enjoy yourself .
The old house on the hill is a landmark in my city .
At the beginning of its history , my city was a big farm .
A river passes by the city and , occasionally , there were floods on the place .
Tired of having their house destroyed , the landlords decided to build a new house on the hill , so they would n't be molested by floods anymore .
There is a tale that mentions a treasure hidden on the house .
This treasure was used to finance a civil war that took place in the south of the country .
After the war , the gold has been left in the house .
People came and destroyed the house looking for the big treasure .
I absolutely disagree with this statement .
There are 7 billion people in the world , and it is increasing rapidly .
How many car for all of people in the world ?
Have you ever driven on the crowded city and moved with 1 km/h .
More people use public transport , less car on the road , you can walk and enjoy the city .
Besides , it 's also an environment problem , exhaust fumes engulfed the earth , more car is used , more exhaust gas release , we are killing our mother .
In addition , those who live on below average incomes do not have money to buy car .
Automobile is luxury in some country , like mine .
It 's the way to prove you wealthy , when you get a car to your home , or go to school , work by a car , people will change their mind about you .
Public transport is being become a must - have mean with many people who have low - income .
In conclusion , Public transport is our future means , I mean for almost citizen .
Not car though it 's convenient .
my favourite sport is swimming , it makes me feeling comfortable and left me in a good mood , i go to swim twice a week , and my advice to anyone want to start to enjoy every moment of it
I have read an article on IFLS talks about a sheep has human face .
It shows in the video that the sheep actually has big nose and lips just like human .
Which is one of the weirdest thing I have seen .
They say the reason why he has a human face is the farmer gave his mom an extra dose of Vitamin A. As a result , that causes the deform in his face .
In my opinion , I think it is just coincidence that the sheep looks like human .
On the other hand , the farmer who owns the sheep refused to sell the sheep for higher price than normal to the circus .
I think the sheep should be transfer to a place where is specialty in animal with same condition .
life is a long journey .everday , we gain more & more experience .
we bocome not only older but also wiser .we learn but the most useful thing to learn is to get in alot of experiences & for sure to make mistakes .but we have to be honest with our selves by admitting our mistakes to avoid them in the future .
I am in Kyoto to eat Yatsuhashi .

Dear Sir Stuart Thomson ,

Nowadays technolgy is more modern than in the past and people always developing their invention to become more useful .
We as a human who live in these days , we live rely on technolgy , every aspect of our live are supporting by technolgy .
And because of technolgy our lofe become easier .
One of the example is television , in the past we use it only for watching news and movie , but as the time goes and the technolgy is developing t , now television has others function .
Television can be used tor many things , usually we watch television for entertaining , but we can also use it for education too .
These are the proofs that television can also educate .
First , television has many programs which are can be used for education .
Many programs consist lessons for kids to learn , for kids who still want to learn speaking and know the words , it is very useful because many programs are very suitable for their to help them learn faster by watching television .
Besides that we can also use television to make us become knowledgeable , by watching news programs .
Second , tthese days television become modern and it make television can connected with internet .
By that advantage , now we can easily search and get information from the internet by using television .
We can search it on browsing or we can also access youtube to help us .
So we can watching a program that we wanted so we can choose what is good and not .
In conclusion , televeision can entertain and also educate because television programs make it in interesting way .
I will talk about my favourite sport .
My favourite sport is football I enjoy playing football with my friends we play at night it was very excited to play when the sky was rain .
When anyone miss to pass the ball or miss scored a goal we shouting on his face are you crazy how you missed this goal !
But we were too interested .
We enjoy watching football match
my favourite sport is football .
I 'm not good at playing it , if I prefer to play volleyball , but I like to watch the games .
The emotions the only try if you 're a fan of any team , and you know the happiness that you feel when it wins , it 's indescribable .
Footbal is usually a sport that appeals primarily to males , but I 'm a girl that sometimes I realize that I know more than some males .
I started following football in 2007 , just 10 years old , I started because I fell in love with a team that then led me to love football in general .
I like to watch the games at home with my father , but mostly always go to the stadium with my dad , you feel indescribable emotions . and my father was to convey this passion .
The future for the public transport should n't be taken lightly , in my opinion , the public transport is the best option for ending the problems with the traffic jam because when we use a bus or subway , a lot of people is travelling from one place at other in only one transport or vehicle .
For many years the public transport had allowed that the people travel a long distance for work that otherwise would not be possible .
Better still the future of the public transport is essential for a better life without traffic .
When we used the car , for general , one person is the unique who is accustomed to using your own car , so not is exploiting the potential of this car .
At the time , we need more cars for more people , that 's the meaning for more traffic .
it 's for this reason that I think the public transport is a great benefit for the society , and a good way for move us of the one place at other , I suggest that the government has to give more means for the purpose of improving the public transport .
Hi freddy ,
I have recived your letter .
I apologise to you for not writing sooner , but I 've been really busy lately .
Your party sounds extremely enjoyable .
Here , parties are normally for family and friends .
The man usually wear their best suits and the woman have long dresses on
George 's restaurant is a very pleasant place with many tasteful recipes from all around the world to enjoy alone or with your company your dinner .
The Head - chef is an experienced and skillful man in his work .

Designed by famous decorators and their partners .
With the latest technology systems for lighting and beautiful painted walls with great masterpieces of well - known artists and upcoming talents .
Last but not least the service is remarkable .
Waiters being happy to help anyway they can and working hard enough to reach their full potential so they can relish you .
So fairly George 's restaurant is one of the most universally recognized restaurants
I 'm afraid I 'm not quite with you , even approve public transport will get more in the future .
You ca n't disagree our global become urbanization in the future , can you ?
That become our life more and more crowd
Today 's television !
Once you have in mind by inviting others to get home and watch TV is what people expected !
The big deal is entertaining , and quality is part of it .
Keep it in mine what you should do before buying your own dreaming TV .
You should consider that large and being untouchable TV is what you must find in one .
However people nowadays look for a good design and not for quality , the big problem is that prize is against quality , even though a good designing of TV series on well known stores is the big option that we can choose to check .
Consider a good prize and good quality by checking and visiting stores , you should not spend too much money by buying the biggest TV or largest , you can save money by only watching few minutes on stores , have your sit , enjoy and list if you are convinced .
In conclusion , enjoy watching movies in your own TV considering prizes and qualities , some TV brings you the experience to enjoy your favourite movies in other scenery , will you try ?
People who reach 18 have to complete military service is an issue , the supporters suggest that is helpful for the 18 to train the physical fitness and psychological quality , whilst opponents point out that is harmful for the human right and affect development of the country .
Consider both aspects that can be concluded that government should respect the human right and set up a new department which use for people who want to apply to complete the military service .
In my opinion our lives will have a dramatic change in the next 50 years .
You just have to think that 50 years ago we did n't know what a smartphone or a laptop was , in the schools we used book of paper and not tablet or iPad , and now technology is part of our lives .
I think and hope that maybe in 50 years scientists will find a cure for many disease and that would change our life because we could live for more time .

The last thriller I have watched is " True Detective " from HBO .
That is eight - episodes film .
First of all I would like to tell about atmosphere of the film .

I was impressed because I ' ve never seen before such films .
That slow - motion action is so impressive that I have been seen that only for one day .
Particulary I would like to point Mathew McConnahy 's role .

This report is aiming to give a clear idea about the environment preserving in my town .

Second , New rules were legislated condemning any person intended to harm the environment in any way .

I am a big fan of Arsenal .
so it comes as no surprise my favourite sport is football .
football is considered to be the most watched and followed sport worldwide .
I would like to look to this sport from different perspectives .
Firstly , football plays a vital role in unifying people locally and internationally , for example it helps US and China to normalize their relations .
secondly , football generates money .
Thirdly , from aesthetic point of view , it was call the beautiful game by Pele .
although I have been playing football for years , I am still not a professional player , this may be because I am not talented .

Dear Sir or Madam ,
I 'm writing you because I 'm interested in applying the job in summer camps .

The diagrams show how bank notes are made .
Firstly , design the bank notes ' backgroud colour it is artwork security issues .
Second preparation metal plates .
It 's skilled machinists .
Then the sheets of bank notes printd .Printing colour on both sides and sprcial ink or images slightly raised .
When printing finished , they should inspection .
It the most important step .
Printed sheets manually inspected .
Finally , they found good quality sheets and some partially damaged sheeets or bad sheets .
They will packaging and distribution the sheets which is good in there .
In that time they at fist cut into separate bank notes , second they packed the sheets and diapatched .
At the same timebad sheets and bank notes securely destoryed .
Why not?.Firstly , what 's for you education?,It 's very clear for me that education is to create the conditions to do your thinkings grow .
If the way to do that it 's easy and nice I think at the end is better than explain theory concepts .
Other reason for my opinión is that almost all the people preffer use the visual sense and ear to other person more than write and listen for understand new things .
while we are spendind good time watching TV our brain is not in calm , only in an other position different to that ones in the rest od the day .
That 's why I think that it 's a good momento to see the thing through a new glass and that can be a very high opportunity .
Deffinitly , No alwyas , It depend on the kind of programme , but I Think that nowdyas a lot of televisión ofert help to the people develop more effectively .
Hunting is the funniest thing I know . I like to hunt because it is so peaceful to come out in the forest .
I start to hunt when I was seven years old .

I hunt most with my dad , and we always have really fun when we hunt but sometimes we can be a bit angry on each other .
Me and my dad have three dogs and we hunt moose , rabbit and roe deer with them .
Their name is Pluto , Krocken and Zelda .
When I 'm with my stepdad and hunt we have very fun because we live in a cabin and it 's a really funny man to I laugh every evening and have very fun .
They 've got many mosses so they shoot very much of them , and they shoot at least every time I am there .
My stepdad shoot a very big moose when I was there with him and I get the trophy of the moose .

when I was ten years old really I like to play football too much . I have joined football - teams which is near to my home , I prefer to this team because of my family is not reach , they can not provide for my transportation fees to go exercises stadium .
The team is not very famous but I know in the future will be .
I try to be football player in there .
The team name is coming location area which is AKSARAY.I prefer to play and watch football as well .
I want to advise all students that start this sport for heath and to fore way for stress , Sports mean is not like to spell time and to loss calorie .
After making sport you will feel your body to be coming strong and you brain will be with out of stress .
Therefore , everyone must make sport according to them ability .
Finally , I prefer to play football because of my health .
In my life , many dreams have existed in my mind , which is sweet , incredible , magical or horrible .
However , one of dreams is keeping in my heart that I ca n't forget it forever .
One night , as usual , I slept .
In a flash , I rolled down from a mountain and I did n't know where I was .
It just a very long tunnel where was dark and strange , After , I felt my body ache .
I began to yell that hoped someone could save me to leave from here .
Fifty minutes passed , when my body no longer was sore .
I decided to walk to the end .
Constantly , I just walked like without terminal contest .
While I strugged to walk .
Finally , I saw a light to appeare my eyes and I woke up .
Seeing same light appeared my eyes .
It lets me feel that it 's a strange dream .
Nowadays we see an enormous improvement of infrastructure .
Nevertheless travel by car is easier for commute for example , because they can choose a personal timetable without a terrible discomfort of buses ; in addiction there is a fair chance that by the end of this century dwellers will stop travelling by public transport , in special way if the government have invested his money in green energy and we could discover a new green car , which in turn revolutionary our life .
Well , the form that we use the television depend one each on .
Will has people that use the television as fun , most of the time ; but has too their people that use television for searchs .
For example , the chanel '' Animal Planet '' has a lot of informations of animals and how it lives .
In my opinion the people use television for distraction .
When we come after the job , or school , we need a form to relax .
Maybe studies we make otherwise ; in search on computers , in books , etc ...
The television 's use is staying more and more utilized by the people ; so we are getting more problems of vision .
It looks like a kind of addiction ... We need to use the technology on our behalf .
The capitalist 's world make us increasingly become us updated .
So we have to watch the national Journal for keep us connected .
Now a days everybody have conditions to buy a television , so the numbers of the tv viwers get up ; even being poor or rich ; most can watch a movie , or a documentary .
There are no apologizes to be a informed person .
To go shopping , is one of these things that you can love or , like it happen to me , you can hate at all .
Normally , I 'm not spending a lot of time on going shopping , even when I really need something .
In general , I find it very boring and stressed .
If I must do it , my favourite way of shop is the high street of my town , or in another town or country .
These shopping centres , full of people and noise , are crazy !
Shopping online is neither , from my experience , a good way of shop .
In my case , I 'm always wrong with the sizes and to return the products , takes me a long time and a great effort , so it does n't worth it .
Much better is to take a walk in the high street , and make from this time something for pleasure .
Socializing online help us to contact with our friends by easy way in different places and this way cost us money .
Socializing person does not cost us money , but we need one place to contact each other .
Finally , we enjoy in both ways in our life .
For the last years , the public transport has been forget .
Now , public transport is not the future , because travelling by car is much more convenient .
The people who do n't use the public transport , think that travelling by car is much better .
But they do n't know the big problem with the pollution .
I think .
If everybody uses the public transport , the world be much better . and the people will be stress less , because they will be not worried about parking places or be in the traffic .
Maybe it will be a really good opportunity for the people , being more healthy too .
Compared with local bookstores , publishers or media such as newspapers considering the Internet market , public transportation has much better future .
There are two reasons .
The first reason is that public transportation carries humans .
Humans are the most sensitive luggage .
You have to take vary much cares when you carry humans .
Even though people trying to develop drones to reduce logistic costs , it is difficult to apply the technology to carry humans .
The second reason is automatic driving technology needs some more time for the development .
Also , the automatic driving technology is already applied for trains .
The running costs will be decreased .
We are going on a vacation Next week .
We prefer to Take A Flight To Hawaii .
We love to travel there and here , but this is the place I wish to go long time ago .
I hope it would be fun there .and thinking about the beautiful scenery makes me felt that I must go while I can .I ca n't wait till the day comes
Dear |Hadeel ,
How are you doing ?
And how is your family doing ?
I hope you are all doing well .
I received your letter yesterday and I was really happy to hear from you .
Following your letter , I want to tell you about The apartment is very Beautiful not big or small medium - sized left inside two rooms , a bathroom and a dining hall and an external director categorize overlooking a beautiful view I am sure he will like it to come and Tri condo b soon , n the end , I would say that I miss you too much and I hope to see you soon .
Take care and goodbye ! ! !
My favorite sport is swimming .
it 's because swimming is really fun .
Also I think swimming can keep your body fit and it can make the swimmer cool down when it is in a summy day .
The advice that I give to someone who want to start swimming .
It is not be afraid of water , otherwise they may not learn swimming and also when the age become older it will be more difficult to learn than the little .
So these are the advice that i give for them .
English - I find it greating !
I like learning English .
It 's my passion .
I like talking to friends and I can communicate with other people .
I ca n't pronunciate well .
I do n't know the stress of words is where .
it 's so difficult .
So bored when I ca n't continue learn English .
Michael was alittle boy he was 10 years old he went with his parents to his grandfather 's home .
The home was on a shore.there was a tunnel but it 's hole is in the deep.first he used to be polite and obay the other orders .
Once a day he met a girl called sarah she was 9 years old inspite of michael was bigger but sarah could control him.every day they went to the sea playing and swimming until the sun set .once a day sarah made a challange with michael about who can enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out from the other hole on the shore but michael was afraid .he was telling himself which animals could be there or is there were air there but he has no choice so he accepted the challange .sarah told him she will go first.she took a breath ... deep one and started to dive .
Micheal was afraid he was waiting for sara to get out he went to the shore to look if she went from the other side but he found no footprints.his mother called him he went home and still thinking about sarah.it was night and ge was afraid ti get there again.he went to sleep .michael closed the door and knew at this moment he had made a mistake .
An clean or healthy environment is always acceptable to all kinds people .
Our city is quite clean and livable , people are more careful than before .
They are sincerely manage wastage and avoid carbon generated products .
Also obedient to the rules and regulation of the city authority .
Initially , Waste management system of our locality is comparatively effective than before .
Our authority now follow the scientific method for rubbish control ; recycle , reuse , galvanization .
As a result , the city dwellers are now enjoying more healthy environment .
It is a more expected criteria , why the authority step up many organization working for waste management .
Due to our helpful people is works become easier .
Most of the cases , not only my family members but also our neighbor like to avoid carbon level increasing products those are responsible for temperature increase .
Many organizations work for making up the consciousness of the pupil , so people are more sensitive about the environmental pollution .
Now government is working for decreasing smoke emission of the mill and industry .
Scientists and researcher jointly work for carbon emission lessening .
Some advancement happened already , it 's implementation also runs with full speed .
Last but nor least , the strict rules and regulation have more effective impact on to make a good town .
Our authority is more careful about the rules and regulation ; hence no - one can eschew the rules .
The job announcement on your webpage immediately took my attention , as it has always been my dream to work for the German - Norwegian Youth Forum and the requirements meet just the skills that I can provide you with .
The first time I took part in the youth forum was in 2012 and since then it has been a big part of my life .
Influenced by it I started to look for universities in Scandinavia .
Since 2013 I am studying English and Marketingscommunications at University College Syddanmark .
It is well accepted that shopping is not always enjoyable , and following is my reasons .
Firstly , shopping can waste you so much time .
You may not realize when you shopping happily .
But you may find that when you notice you have many things still need to finish .
Secondly , shopping can make you upset because of something you can not afford .
You may come across something , such as luxury bags , but you can not buy it because of the tight budget .
Furthermore , even you just buy something you can afford , you may also waste much more money .
So , based on what I have written , I think shopping is not always very happy . We can find something much happier than shopping easily .
My favourite sport is cricket . I love cricket very much since from my school time .
cricket is a game of bat and ball in which there are two teams which have eleven players on each side .
generally we are using criket ground as a oval shape .
Travelling by car is certainly much more convenient than travelling by tram or trolley bus , which only follow the lines of their routes .
But thinking about the environment , traffic jams and sometimes absence of parking places makes me changing the statement .
On one hand you put all your things in the car and drive anywhere you want to , on the other hand if you feel not very well to drive , you have no money to buy a car or the downtown of your city is closed for all the means of transport except for the public ones : tram , bus or trolley bus is your wayout .
HOW YOU CAN THE BEST LOOK AFTER YOUR ENVIRONMENT ?
Good question about item , how can answer , if you would win £ 100 .
I have a few easy recepts , how you can be a well off £ 100 and how you can help the environment .
Firstly , I describe how I can help my local environment and what I do useful for item .
I am a very stricte keen ecology person for 10 years .
I am interesting about natural ways how we could help in the local area .
I am a serious fan of environment .
I describe how it looking my every day .
I tend to drive with my bicycle from home to work , I do n't used my car or buses for long time , because is not healhty and costs .
A bicycle is for me the best way how we can be do fit and a good condition and also to more less polution without cars .
Secondly , I save water and electricity , because costs are quit expensive .
So , my bills from water are inexpensive , because I swap to have a bath than take a shower .
Next point is an issue , that if I am not at home I do switch off the temperature .
I switch on a home hiting for a temporary time , when I am working off I used more energy to warmht at home .
Next point is a fact , that recycle glass and paper is most important .
I tend to collect in three different boxes of waste , for paper , second for glas and plastic and third for rest rubbish .
It 's a very domestic and a huge issue for us life .
We learn to really segreation of waste and in the future how e.g.:we could use second time a same glass .
Finally , we are obligatory to care about the environment , because it 's us duty .
I think it is true , because o lot of people like travelling by car .
But there are some problems like these - how will drive a lot of people who do n't like to drive or ca nt drive because he has some problems with the health .
Anyway , a lot of people will need some transport in some cases not privat , but public , and we ca nt say that this kind of transport willl not be useful .
May be , in small part
Some years ago when the weather was colder here people had eaten more meat with wine .In fact growing vegetables was not possible because of the weather .
In fact today people interested in drinking wine during participating at parties or meeting with friends .
There are various opinions about how foods plays essential role in our lifestyle .
Potatoes and meat are popular food between our people .
Although healthy diet is quite expensive young people follow special diet in order to have better body shape or healthy life .
Actually modern life affected on our palate changing .Instance some people who work majority of their waking houres prefer to use fast food more .
Our commitments imposes us to forget ourselves and our healthy .
It may be cause increasing wight or reducing the number of necessary vitamines which our body needs .
In my view the reason of having more energy during the day lies in the diet program which is followed by each of us .
In conclution if we have decision to living long following suitable diet is crucial and unavoidable .
The members of my family is no where near my best friends .
You see , I do not see members of ones family ones best friends because personally I did n't and still do n't have a great relationship with anyone in my biological family .
And this may have effected my way of thinking and acting in different situations .
So no , my members in my biological family is n't my best friends .
Dear Sir ,
Thank you for giving me the chance to transfere the information as per your request .
For my town , there are many regulations that are forced by the municipality and environment ministry , such as preventing animals like ( sheeps , horses , cows .. etc ) , from being in the town and in the population areas .
Besides , due to the critical situation we are living and facing in iraq .
As we are fully depending on the indivitual generators , that are causing multiple problems in he weather dueto it 's smoke , the oil and gass left behind , in addition to sound offcourse that are themain source for the 18 countinous hours noise .
people , espicially grnerator 's owner , start using Canaopies , using very long pipes to get rid off as possible as they can from the polution .
Other resedential areas , using their potentialsto maintain the environment by planting trees , roses , having nemourse green spaces .
Also recycling the trushes are a very inteligent way to keep the town clean , and get multiple use of the products in industry lines .
on the Otherhand , eldest people in our city having many socity responsiblties that are encourging the youngest ages to participate in the annual gardening festival , for the indoor and outdoor gardens .
Finally , we always believe that one hand can not clap .
Although , each house can make a real difference by taking good care of the infront area and keeping it clean .
Hope that those information are of good use .

Michael and Marcuangolo were friends but in the school they were enemies .They had amazing battles in the playground .
One day at the end of the classes , Marcuangolo wanted to hit him , and Michael ran away .
Michael stopped and hit his enemy .
Marcuangolo fell in the street .
A car crashed and Marcuangolo started bleeding .
Michael took his enemy to the hospital .
There was a doctor at the emergency room and Michael explained the problem to him .
The doctor was angry and Michael cried .
They brought Marcuangolo to a room and put the boy in a bed .
The doctor ask for his phone number and he phoned his parents .
Michael understood that he must take away .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
As soon as I came on university , my life changed .
Before I entered university , life in high school had n't a lot of friends and I was so lonely but after I started to study at Ton Duc Thang university , I became more happy , comfortable and interactive .
In my class , I have a group of close friends , and they treated me very well .
I'll have a friend at university because I scared strangers .
The first day when I studied at the university , I had a lot of friends .
we sit around together and talk about where they live .
At the weekend , I like going for a walk and get some fresh air with my friend .
We laughed and eating together .
I was very happy at the time , and I have the friend sincerely .
I expect we 'll be the best friends forever .
it was a wonderful experience with me
I was walking to football training session with my friend Michal last week .
It was raining and it was dark .
The weather was horrible .
We were talking about the last match , we were discussing our faults , when suddenly we heard a loud noise .
It turned out that a bus hit a lorry just in front of us .
The people were screaming .
Some passengers were hurt and weak .
I ran to help them and also we called the ambulance .
The police came after 5 minutes and the ambulance too .
It was a scary situation .
We were shocked !
Hi Isabel
I am living in Deria which is located in Dubai .
It is small and quite city .
I like the Indian resturants in the city , in addition infrastructure and roads are well orgnaise .
obeying to the statement above , it 's necessary to say that is a very interesting topic , because it 's quite related to actual problems , such as problems in the environment .
This is to say that most part of cars are not green , namely , current cars are not designed for generate a good impact in the environment .
Regarding the reason for the described situation is due to the strong economic interests of oil companies which are intended to get as much money as possible , regardless of the damage that they are causing to species of plants and animals .
Thus , the question is , travelling by car is so much more convenient for whom ?
For multinational maybe ?
Or for some consumers that can afford a toxic and expensive car ?
, even though , when the public transport gets so crowded , is less harmful indeed , in terms of the impact received by the environment , because it means more individuals in the same place , meanwhile each new car means increasingly pollute .
Travelling by would be more convenient with a good conscience of protect the planet .
The idea of banned cars from the centre of all major cities have advantages and disadvantages .
The good things about not allow cars in the cities centres are that the traffic will be reduced , the trips will be faster and the contamination will be less .
On the other hand the bad things are that you have to park out of the city centre and these areas will be crowded , you could n't visit places with your car and people with physical problems could have difficulties with public transport .
In my opinion it is a good idea , but perhaps the restriction could have exceptions for certain people and certain days and hours , or if you need to visit a particular place with your car you could ask for a special permission .
The village I live , there is a lot of vegetation for that reason we try to protect environment , some of the things we do is to give mantainance every week to the vagetation zone checking if there is any garbage , to avoid this we teach the younger 's enviromentalist actions so they do n't throw cans , paper , or , candies to the floor they also can help the older people , there are cases which a person throws garbage to the street's , floor or to the vegetation to avoid that happening again we have a punishment that is to pay some money if the do n't they wo nt be allowed to enter the village park and zoo again , unless they were visitors , in that case we told him or her the way we live in the village and , we give him or her advises to keep a beautiful place without garbage .
More environmentalist action we use is to protect the wildlife by takeng care of themthere is to that we have a center of care and , other more institutions , we also make environmental protection centers were people can visit and learn about this to sum up our village is very concentrated on taking care of the natural world that sorrounds us

In my opinion public transportation is most convenient way to travelling . The air pollution is a one reason that I prefer public transportation .
On the other hand it is very economic than owne car .
Whatever you can save the time and go any where more quickly by public transport .
Nowdays , in school we learn a lot of subjects , which we less or more use in our lives , some of them are really important , but some of them are just wasting of time .
On the one hand , we had n't to range subjects by their

FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY 'S
all begins in 1981 when freddy fazbear 's pizza open , the establishment it 's a pizza restaurant but this pizza restaurant in had robots , in 1981 there were four animatronics and their names are Chica , Foxy , Bonnie and Freddy .
Three robots in specific hour make a show with instruments like a band .
Foxy the pirate makes a show individually in her pirate cove , The children loves Foxy because plays with the kids making questions about the pirates and count a pirate story .
When freddy begin to sings the kids screams and they sing with Freddy the famous Freddy Fazbear 's Song , Bonny plays the battery and Chica serves the pizza to the children , This year the stablishment close because they found the body of a dead child .
In 1983 The pizza restaurant reopened with more security and robots with more friendly appearance .
The establishment seek a security guard who had to keep the pizza restaurant at night , I am the security man .
When I saw the advertisement about the job in this moment I think that is very easy , I called the number , they give me the information and I accept .
The rules are simple just see the laptop , watch the animatronics , wait to 6:00am and close the doors if you needed I say OK .
My first night was easy because only see the screen and pass the camera to camera and nothing strange happened , I could only hear footsteps and noises .
My second and third night they were very strange because in the cameras the animatronics move as if it wanted to get to my room and do something to me .
The fourth and fifth night were the worst because the animatronics were very active , closed it and opened the doors because they try to get into my room .
but I could survive the night .
After tonight remove me the place and never went back to Freddy 's Pizza

Hi friend ,
In this holiday I go to Barcelona with my girlfriend .
It is an amazing city , it is really enjoy .
You can see monuments , theatres , beaches and different shops .
It is the most European city of Spain .
Rosetta becomes first spacecraft to orbit .
After a long flight , it reaches the orbit that is very long way far out of the solar system .
NASA replied as a very amazing achievement that Rosetta reaches out of solar system .
This may become a have leap after Armstrong landed on the Moon .
NASA replied that Rosetta will keep on its journey on travelling across the Universe .
Travelling by car becomes a comfortable factor nowadays because we can stop and go whenever we want , we can start at our desired timings .
This would gradually kill public transport .
One more reason is that banks provides loan at a lower interest which makes people to buy one to improve their comfort level .
People 's lives will not change if they do n't change themselves .Everyone want to improve his life to be better but how without doing anything . we must to start with education and healthy which are most important things to be better .
everyone need to focus not only his education but also on others .
To learn , to read , to be knowledge .
We need to focus on our inner skills and improve it .
No progress will happen without plan .Each one has a dream want to achieve it but first of all he need to put a plan and also cognitive one .
Our great example in changing is German .
after the second world war the improved themselves in 50 years and became one of the most developed countries .
In my city is very usual to find many dog 's shits in the road .
Is a big problem and it is almost a miracle not stepping one .
The solution I think would be to fine to owners .
I think that not is a problem of awareness .
I think the people know that his dogs litter the city but they prefer not to do nothing .
It is easier and more comfortable .
If they would had to pay then they would do .
In general the city looks clean .
The cleaning services work well .
Normally in the night .
In the hall tow care about city Center .
There are plants everywhere .
Madrid has many parks and many trees .
These also can be a problem because recently they are falling because they are older .
The hall tow has created a group that works studying the tree 's age to prevent further falls
We should must proper planing for our city to proper look after of it .
Actually , there are many huge problems are in your city just as there are no any proper drainage system for it not any specific canal system through which we can properly cleaned our city .
There , is another issue that is due to huge transport but little bit road they are not wide enough so that most of people are distributed due to these issues .

It 's known that the different recently situation that there are now with young people .
I used to go to a Christian school here in Granada , in this school there were good values like share or help to other person .
Moreover , my parents , who are teachers , they have been teaching me how I must educate , for several years .
I asked myself If I had had the possibility of change the world , I would have tried to do all that in your hands .
I always think this , because teenagers are the change of our planet .
So , if you need a person like me , I would like to work with young people .
I 'm looking forward to your reply
Best of wishes .

I was born 2001 in august the 10th in Danderyd .
I have two little brothers , Gus and Soren .
I have always lived in Danderyd .
My favorite sports/ hobbies is windsurfing and sailing .
The best place i ever have been on is an island in the east archipelago in Sweden .
Its not much trees there and a lot of high mountains .
There is much that i 'm proud of in my life but actually i do n't know what i 'm most proud of .
A very big weakness i have is that i can forget nearly everything especially homework and other school stuff .
Three words that describe me really good is :
happy funny and sometimes bothersome
A thing that i would like that people knew is that its not a good idea that wake me when i m sleeping .
I do n't actually know .
some day i want to go to Bali because it 's seems like a really nice place .
three things that i could do with is a bike , to be sick and bad computers .
my favorite movie is the wolf of wall street .
i do n't have a favorite book .
my favorite song is prayer in C
my favorite singer is AVICII
Simpsons or family guy .
my favorite food is fillet beef with bea and pommes .

If you have a car you would probably think that travelling by car is better than by bus , but there are a lot of people who does n't have a car so they are used to go by bus and for them this way of travelling has become more conveniet because they have done it since they were children .
Then whatever the opinion you get is the result of the social situation in what you live .
Most people say that using public transport is better than using cars , and they say that its cheaper and better for the environment , about me I think that cars is easier and affordable way to transport between places , because cars is here any time and so near to your home instead of public transportation which you should take a walk to reach it in most countries , and also cars available all the time , you can go at 4 am and no one say anything , because its yours , but most public transportation is available only for the day hours and few hours at night , in emergency situation for example , what you will do , if you do not have your own car , your kid is sick , or you wife or your old parents , and in general the more we depend on ourselves the more our government able to help the poverty and homeless people out there , who really need more help and aid from the public community , we merely ask the government to improve streets and the traffic light systems , and more oil stations and parking in the streets , to be able to drive and move easy and safe and in a short time .
Everyone use public transport every day .
It is difficult to imagine how we can live without it .
But in spite of this a lot of people have a dream about a car .
The most said that using a car more convenient than using a public transport .
Of course private transport has a lot of advantages like : you do n't need to wait for a bus at the stopes or you can go every where you want in the time convenient for you .

I saw it with my family , my children and my husband , we had a good afternoon .
The film is based on a girl , she is invited to many weddings in which she is a maid of honor in all of them .
She has twuenty seven dresses of maid of honor , meantime , she call in love with a boy who is very handson , but he is working in a magazine and he has written about weddings in the city , he is a good writer , and she unknowns that .
The plot is well constructed , since the beginning becomes quite gripping .
The main characters , the actors are very younger and enjoyable .
This history develors a mixture of themes that courage , family values , friendly and love .
In conclusion , if you want to have a good time , you shoudl go to the cinema to see this film with your family , because it is an interesting and emotional film .
Nowadays we have a lot of environmental problems .
Transport polution is one of the most dangerous .
Almost every family have more than one car .
As a result roads are overloaded and long kilometres traffic jumps damage open air .
On the one hand that quantuty of cars ca n't be forbidden , because it 's personal right to have it or not .
On the other hand the government should think about some measures for protecting environment .
For example inventing severals special dates in a year for using only public transport .
Also improving measure might be as an encreasing green areas in cities and towns .
Rivers and seas are in danger too .
Unfortunately many tourists do n't take care about saving personal spaces ( on the river bank or on the sea beach ) in clean .
Factories damage nearest areas and water extremaly bad .
In my opinion , firstly , new bilding on the banks must forbidden at all .
Secondly , rules for tourists about caring environment must be very strick .
I think , nature'll get the most important benefits if everybody takes care about own space in the best way .
When it comes to health , it does cover physical and mental status too .
Sports is a unique way by which a person can maintain his or her health including both aspects that are physical and mental .
My favorite sport is Hockey .
The different formats of cricket allow me to maintain my health based on time available after earning my bread for the day and it is needless to say after sharing the precious moments with my lovely family .
I often participate in friendly matches to keep physical abilities up to the mark .
While putting lot of stress on physical abilities , it is needless to say the day can be tiresome if one may decide to play in the longer version of the game , but it is equally challenging how you would keep up your mantle status .
It does require to explore your brain while developing strategies against the opponents .
It becomes essential to create a spontaneous Plan B when Plan A did not work .
Top of all , one has to learn to maintain the sportsmanship , irrespective of the result or heated moments on the field .
In the present world television is very important .
But sometimes it can also affect us in a negetive way .. most people around the world can see any news in live.media is more help full for the people .television is also using as a study material for example smart classes ,
online courses etc . television is more important media we can improve our language with the help of the television.now we can see
that so many films with the help of television and we can see other programs also.according to the present world without television
no one can live as a human being so that we can say that television is more impotent .

One day , Michael were going to school for his final examination .
saddenly , an old carried a heavy load hit him and fall down .
When he got up he insulted him and tried to beat him , when he returned home , he closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .

hello!I am 32 years old girl from Italy .
I really love take care of myself and so the last years I decided to do walking every day in the evening .
It 's takes 1 hour and at the end I am very happy and in a good mood .
I love walking near the arbour of my city , so I can have a look to the beautiful sea ! when I walk I feel the clean wind and so I take long breaths .
If you walk on the seaside in the evening you can have also the possibility to see the sunset over the sea .... that ' great emotion ! I feel good in that way and even my soul can have a breath .
I suggest everybody having the same evening walking , you need just a pair of comfortable shoese !
There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is cheaper than public transport .
commuters prefer to travel by car compared to public transport .
The main reason for people do n't like to travel by public transport is due to overcrowding
Travel by train is very expensive nowadays .
People prefer the car rather than public transport due to sexual harassment .
Dear Federico ,
Like you know , I was work in a youth camp the last year , so that if you want to take this job I would like say some things that will help you .
In the positive side , the size of the groups is really small .
I had 25 children and it is a good number for working well .
This kind of job is very useful if you want improve your English skills .
I recommend this experience .
On the negative side are the labor conditions . The money is not enough for pay the level of living in London and else the money for " travel expenses " , in my case , arrived until November !
Can you believe it ?
In any way , I recommend that you take the job for August , because I have listened that in this month the organization is better than in July .
I wish you luck and a good experience .
Regards , Alex

Nowadays , each family has several cars to use for their daily needs .
It 's much faster much more convenient than using public transportation .
The only drawback that comes along using cars is limitation in fuel resources .
However , it seems that each day a new source for extracting fuels is exploring .
Beijing is the capital of China , it is the political , economical and cultural center , but also a city of long history .
It was the capital of Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty.so it has many ancient architecture , like Ming Tombs , the Summer Palace , The Temple of Heaven , the Forbidden City .
Especially the Forbidden City is the largest architectural complex which is best - kept in the current .
It represents the highest architectural achievement in the ancient China .
The Great Wall is located in the north of Beijing .
It is more than thousands of mails long .
It has been starting build from Qin dynasty , Its use was to resist Huns , but now it is a great place to visit .
These architecture also represents the culture of China .
Beijing is also a city which has many kinds of snacks and foods from different countries .
You can taste Peking Duck , Sichuan spicy diced chicken , Henan stewed noodles and Yue dishes ...
Now Beijing is a large international city , it will inherit the elements of history and develop much better .
" The reality of transportation is that it is future oriented .
If we 're planning for what we have then we are behind the curve " , Anthony Fox .
Transportation has a major role in a society as life revolves around motion .
When we talk about convenience , comfort and safety then private transport is more likely to consider .
In certain emergency cases , running for a bus seems harder than jumping up in your own car .
Private transport is totally on your own , so there remains no tension of reaching a certain station on a specific time .
Travelling privately makes one free of the issues as harrasment .
Although many transport providers look forward to eradicate this problem , yet it remains .
Public travelling may trouble the passengers due to increasing fares .
People often tend to go on their own as private transport such as cars can be bought easily on loans provided by banks .
Looking on a wider span , cars are these days available according to the public demand .
For instance , fuel - efficient , luxurious and economical cars are easily available .
With the advancement of the automobile industry , public transport will not be considered as the first choice in the coming years .
The above discussion suggests that people find private transport a safer , convenient and comfortable mode of travelling .
The city was deserted that night , as Michael and I wandered through the narrow streets .
It had been raining earlier and the full moon shone brightly on the wet stones .
Suddenly we heard the sound of running footsteps .
Then there was a cry and the footsteps stopped .
Nervously , we walked back .
Perhaps someone had been killed , or kidnapped in the street
We were going to see what happened , and we had something to see .
There was one old granny who was beat up .
We try to gave her help but she was so heavy and we could not do that . Than we were trying to find help ,
but nobody was opening doors .
On our luck I had a mobile phone , but Michael was saying that we need to escape because we did not know are those bullies near the corner .
My plan was to phone my dad and an ambulance and I 've done that .
After we came to the ambulance , police come and one patrol was catching those man who made that to that granny and the other patrol was talking to us .
I found out that granny name is Rose and she had got operation after the accident .
To our relief , she was saved and when we went to granny room , we saw smile on her face .
We were also happy , but in Michael head came a lot of things .
He knew that if we escape at that moment when the granny was at the ground , she would most probably die .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
My name is Kamaldeen I 'm 31 years old I 'm married and I do n't have children .
I moved with my family from Jordan to Saudi Arabia in 1995 .
I began studying when I came to Saudi Arabia in third grade .
I rose up in Al Qassim region and I lived the best time in my life in Al Qassim .
I have big family contains from my father and mother and I have seven brothers and three sisters .
I studied in Al Qassim University and my major Microbiology .
I graduated from my college in 2001 after that I got job in ministry of health and I have been working there since 2010 .
I like a lot of activities such as travelling , readillng , play soccer and watch movies .
I still believe that public transport will be more popular in the future due to benefits it provides for us . Travelling by car is more convenient but expensive .
Travelling pubic is cheaper .
On the other hand , not everybody can own the car .
Public transport is suitable for those who have no own car .
Besides , public transport will reduce traffice jam .
Today , government focus on how to improve public transport and they also increase their supporting .
So public transport is improved continuously .
I think it will be the favourite transportation for all of us .
My favorite sport is volleyball .
This sport cause fresh and jolly me and I think will exercise cause healthy.if you start volleyball , you need a ball and piece of ground that separate with tie .
Shopping takes place the biggest part especially to women , but sometime it becomes not so enjoyable and I agree with this statement .
First of all , shopping is not satisfying when you are tired , or you are hungry , or maybe it is just your personality who does n't like crowds of people walking around .
Secondly , if you can not find what you are looking for , you will not beam with happiness .
What is more , you will not be satisfied with the shopping if you lack money and can not afford to buy the thing which you really want .
To sum up , I would like to say that , if you are in bad mood or lack of money then you will not be able to feel pleasure of it .
Human live has change a lot in the last years , and it seems that this will happened faster every day , the technology advances and the changes in the way of thinking , are adapting to a different kind of people with each human generation .
Technology advance way to fast and it is really difficult guessing what kind of stuff or artefacts will be fifty years from now , but we can guess some ideas like flying cars , smartphones with the size of a small paper , laptops really thin like quarter of inch , clothes that clean itself or change the color and shape , healthier food , smarter electrodomestics .
All this will help people to live easily , but only to have more time to work , because the type of mind that reign that time will focus in the companies and make money and spend it , this is the reason why a lot of jobs are changing to a home office and the firms are giving more and more facilities to their employees to be more efficient .
At the end , the kind of live that we will see in fifty years from now will have a lot of stuff to help the people to have a more comfortable , easier and faster way of live , but this will be only to meke more money and consume more and more , also the things will be faster of waste to make the people to change their apparel more often and create a consumerism .
Nowadays , an increasing number of people are concerned about the phenomenon that armland , forest and wetland is disappearing for some long - term human activities , for instant housing and transport networks is builded by destroying the balance of environment .
Firstly it is clear that more house and transport networks is convenient for our people , what is knowed to us is that the population growth is a big problems , which is needed for more palce to living .
And builing more transport networks is also benifit for us , for example , the high - speed rail can be shorteded our time in traveling.while the animal may not welcome to it ,
In order to command the psychology of user , it was necessary for me to know the new tendency of UI
design .
Therefore , with the good UI design , many people will have the user experience with pleasure .
The good user experience will be good to collect data and be good for making a decision in commerce .
Once upon a time there was living a little girl in a small town .
She was very shy , sensitive and embarressed .
She dreamt about living in a big city where anyone would n't know her .
She had just wanted to hide from this world .
Her name was Lora .
Lora has grown up and become a very pretty adult .
She has mooved to Kyiv , graduated from university and started to work .
Althought she tried to hide she has become a great and a famous model .
She has even got a boyfriend , Michael .
She loved him ..
He was her first man , best friend and lover .
He was everything for her .
He loved her for her flame .
He wanted to own all she had .
From time to time it seemed to him that he loved her .
But it was very short emotion .
Once Lora came and told him that she was sick .
She cried .
But Michael was n't worried .
Lora noticed his coldness .
She asked him to go .
She was killed by his coldness .
He went out .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Football is my favorite sports In my life.so,I pay more attention to it than any other things you might think of .
I had been following series of football 's events in and around the world at large .
I took this time to command people who are sacrificing their entire life of the betterment of sportsmanship .
With all that , I do have my favorite club team n country as well .
And also have my favorite players , Ronaldinho , Messi and Eto'o .
My favorite club is Barcelona and country is Cameroon although that I am from Liberia .
I know football does n't go by sentiments but the love of choice and what desire you the best .
What really makes me to love Barcelona is that they play the football , instead of them running around .
They always bring talented players that will make the club be more improved tactically.people always say this;"Barcelona does n't buy players"it 's not like , they are lacking money .
We do essential purchasing of players to save more money .
You have to save money for players to enable you to pay them on time .
As normal humanbeings , you have to know how to spend money , where , when to spend it.it's not because you have more money then you lavish it .
So , i love my team and my staff and how they run things in my team .
The facts should not be hidden Barcelona is the best club team in the world , you like or not .
I am writing about the international sports I have seen monthly magazine .
I enjoy this sport because it is comfortable and elegant also you never hurt yourself badly .
Furthermore , you also have a lot more confidence in yourself .
The advice I would give to someone who starting this sport .
first of all you should eat healthy food to have a good physic , do more exercises and sleep less .
Most people who play Tennis are always ready and proud about themselves .
Every day I wake up at 05:00 AM and go to bed at 10:00 PM .
I reach home at 13:00 then I take my lunch and relax for an hour .
In the evening I watch movies .
we all know that do sport is very important to keep our life healthy and happy .
My favourite sport actually is walking;and I prefer walking in the morning and before sundown .
I like also walking in public street , gardens , clubs and on the shore.when i want to go anywhere;I do my best to go on foot .
I like this sport since my childhood because I found that I can think about my good time when I was child and relax with myself to think carefully about my present and future .
The walking can also fitness and do the knee stronger .
It would be interesting to accompain your best friend or your beloved to enjoy your time .
I advice my guys who suffer from laziness and overweight , try to walk one hour at least and after that they will like this sport .
Hi !
I want to begin with one thing : I do n't have a favorite sport or something on that , but I really like to do exercises for my body .
I think it 's important to maintain our tone and of course our health .
Because , when we practice a sport or some simple exercises we feel how the body receives energy , that it 's happening with me .
But we have concrete examples , which we should wear follow and which already demonstrated that nothing it 's impossible .
Like Nadia Comaneci or Gica Hagi , they are two people which succeeded in their sport but with perseverance and ambition .
They are passionate by that they do , more concrete those are fall in love with their job .
It is an important thing to love and like a lot what we practice , because that it 's the key .
The pleasure and your will will help you to succeed and to get the best scores .
In my point of view , this subject , the sport , the favorite sport is one of most pleasant for me .
I love to do joking in the morning and then to do a lot of exercises for my legs and arms .
If I do that , now the day is one of my best days , it 's a managed day for me .
In conclusion , I do n't have a favorite sport , I like to do a little of all and I do n't refuse nothing .
Flori .
This crime was happened about six years ago .
It was in Italy , exatly in Bergamo .
Yara finished one of your training .
Her parents , after an halp past hour of the training 's finish , became preoccupied .
The parents called her , but she did n't answer .
Then , when she did n't return at home , her parents reported the passing of their daughter .
The surveys were concentraded above all in the construction site of Mapello .
In December 2010 , Fikri was banged - up by the police .
Three month after her passing , she was rediscovered dead along the stream .
Definitely , the public transportation does n't have any future .
A good amount of the population prefer to buy a car to go to the school , work place , church on a faster on comfortable way .
Every year thousands of car are sell and the demand is growing .
Probable the only opportunity to change this will be to remark on people the opportunity to save energy and diminish the environment contamination if we use public transportation .
Television has many advantages .
It is not only entertains , but also educates .
There are many educational programmes which we can get penfit of it .
Good films can also entertain and educate at the same time .
Football is the most popular sport followed in Italy and in Europe , in fact there is some important tournament where participate all important Europe team , They are called " Champions League " and " Europa League".football is a team sport in fact in this sport participate everyboby without exclude nobody .
The people start to play football in a regulatory pitch , after some time they will be tired , but it is normal because their muscles are not enough strong for running around the pitch for many times .
If you often train your muscles will become very strong .
Another thing you do not have is the ball control .
The ball control is the control you have when you run with the ball .
you can improve it running with the ball and gradually you will improve your ball control .
How to make true mistake ?
I 'll tell you a story happened at school
as any normal pouring day when you teenager in school never ever end , but a one day was the best day from any other pouring normal day because i learn how live as powerful smart girl who used to let the other us her because she want to feel needed from my friends but i did not have many friends in school except " Michael " .
all my class called me creep ugly geek but still little good only when a teacher want from them a research or the exams

Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Pollution as a problem in the environment
Years ago , pollution was not a big problematic to deal with .
Technology was not as advanced as it is now , so the amount of waste was small .
Our ancestors used to live in a unselfish life .
Nowadays , pollution is a plobelmatic that we have to solve before it gets worse .
A new way of transport mut be included .
We are used to driving a car and we do not notice how much damage we cause . We should start using new ways of transport as go by bike or by walking .
Not only will solve pollution , also it will help us to discard obesity .
We Should include new alternatives of transport in our routines .
Rivers and seas are victims of modernization .
We have no idea of how much damage factories causes to the rivers and seas .
In fact , the factories waste goes to the rivers .
The government should improve a new law to regularize this damage .
As we can see modernization is causing damge in rivers and seas .
In my opinion , Pollution is a problematic on the entire world , not only in modern countries , so we should try to recycle more , any kind of help is necessary .
Dear grandmother ,
How are you ?
I haven't seen you for a long time .
I have a new beautiful pair of shoes .
These are white with black and blue lines .
I love it .
My mother gave me for my birthday .
I 'm going to celebrate my birthday next week in my house .
Would you like to come ? I 'm going to invite all my friends and family .
It 's going to be amazing .
See you soon .
Jazmin .
Hi Jo ,
I am very happy because the time spent very fast .
I did n't have anything news about you .
You can come here when you have time because my house is your house .
While you are with me , you will do curriculum vitae and after we will travel around my country and we will become a good workerds .
This idea is fantastic , although this will be very complicated .
However the best option is that you came here and after I present my friends and their fathers because they can help with your job .
On the other hand , I do n't recommend travel because this is very expensive .
If you came here , you will see a lot of country and you travel around the world .
But it is your decision , these options are my advice .
I will look forward to your notice about your decision , but I am very nervous because if you are with me , I will have the best summer in my life and I will be very happy because we will do parties with a lot of friends .
You must remember that the money are very important in your decision .

To the door and open it , result that was my brother .
After that say hi and go with him inside , he told me that our mom was goon to a trip for a week and we have to take care of my little sister .

Whatever i decided to said yes and prepared myself to take care of her .
My brother go and he promised to return later with my sister .
I closedthe door whishing never have to opened again , then i went to the bathroom and took a relax shoower .
I practise Pilates Method every Sunday morning .
I like this sport because it is a simply healthy sport that respects my body .
I practised danse a long time ago but with ages , I 've preferred to practise an easier sport .
I discovered Pilates 2 years ago and began with a old Bejar dancer .
He took time to explain each movement and made me understanding the concept .
After 10 times I obtained results on my body : stretch , sinewy and flexible .
If I could give advices to new practisers of Pilates , it should be to read a book about this method and to take time choosing a goog teacher .
A few years previously I took part in one programme name called Christmas Drama .
In my school ages I did not participate any programme even sports .
Because school teachers never encourage me to participate .
If they told me to attend compulsory I will do without any hesitation .
While I were in ANDRAPRADESH every year we have Christmas function in December although we are not interested to attend Drama they were not leave us without participation even simple character .
They gave me a character like THE GOD .Firstly I never aware about how act and do this particular character .
And from October to till December we practise everyday after our study hour up to eleven " O"CLOCK.DAY BY DAY I learn and finally I did my role well .
Then I think myself why I wasted all my school days .
Personally I believe that those who are not participate any activity the teachers has them to encourage .Then only they also know how talented they are .
Every student should attend and show their talent .
After some ages we can not attend any this type of activity because we all are become old .So let do and enjoy your young age be happier .
The future of public transport in developed countries is very different , because most people have a car , in the people who live in poor countries , most people take public transport , because people does n't have a car and is cheaper take public transport , the pollution of public transport is huge and is growing third world countries should have , eco friendly transport .
I did n't use to believe in that people would do everything for advantage , even betraying family and friends .
I thought that was only seen in film .
The real world would not like that .
I strongly believed people would rather have love in the heart than everything .
I was n't rich , not having many good things , only a sample person , but I lived happily .
At least I had a stable job , lover , family and friends .
However , these things have changed , All the things I have been owning , building , remaining are broken .
It is hard to believe my eyes that I could see the avidity under their eyes , as if they could n't wait to see me dead , they ca n't become brilliant so long as I am alive .
I have always tried to convince them that I am not that bad some people said .
My family live in the city center of Madrid but I do n't like living here because it is noisy and there is contamination , so I decided to move to the county side two years ago .
I love this place because it is relaxing but the only problem for me is I live alone and I 'm lonely .
My mother knew my feeling and she wanted help me .
She came to my house with a present last week and when I opened it ... I could n't believed it " It was a little and beautiful monkey !
I was so exciting and very happy .
For me it was like to have a new member of the family and he lived with me .
Since these moment my life changed and now I go to every place with " Yango " monkey 's name
Dear Sir / Madam
I am writing this letter in order to apply for the job in the " usa summer camps " .
I saw the job advertisement in the local newspaper .
To start with , I would like to tell you that I have studied gastronomy in the Instituto Crandon , one of the most recognised institutes in Uruguay , also , I have just finished the sports and health course in the Universidad de la Republica , in which I learned to work from children to adults in the sports area .
I think every people love sport .
In the world very famous sport festival is Olympic .
There included many kind sports such as wrestling , basketball , tennis , running .. etc .
My favourite sports are basketball and martial art .
First , Basketball is team sport when it means i need to understand expression of members of team and keep contact them for example my roll is cutter but i need to do assister , blocker and guarding when i play .
Secondly , Every country have own martial art history and culture that is kungfu from China , taekwondo from Japan and Karate form Korea .
It not just fighting these sport give people durability , speed and power .
Especially i like karate and Kung - fu .
Man and women whose are possible to interest it .
There is not special criteria such a tall and strong muscle or gender .
These 2 sports improving human basic ability to reach as possible high capability .
I suggested to other people first to understand yourself such as what do you like , which is possible and than practice after every success
my favourite sport is badminton .
it 's a game between 2 or 4 people .
they use a bat and a shuttlecock which is like a bao feather .
purpose score most points .
I sometimes play badminton with my brother , and I always win .
I think I am good player .
my first play badminton when I was 7 years old .
positives ways for playing badminton : you can lose weight , you vision will be good etc
negatives ways for playing badminton : you right arm is more strong than you left arm , sometime , you are sprain your arm .
I 'm sure is very heath for your body .
According to this form , we can know learning knowledges takes a part of time in one day .
Unlike Taiwan 's senior high schools students , their sleeping time average in eight hours even more .
As for me , my daily schedule do n't have much options , just only study , sleep and others .
Others include in rest and exercise , but they do n't occupy lots of time .
In my awareness , I know United States advocates free - style study and self - learning , so they aside from study , they have diversity selections .
When it comes to my sleeping , I only have four to five hours in a day .
The lake of sleep often maks me ca n't concentrate in class .
the more remind myself to get up early , the more things i need to do .
So it usually postpones my sleeping time .
The only common option is rest time , I also spend three to four hours .
Because i think family and friends are my spirit medicine , they can give me lots of energy .
First , I am to say that People 's lives change in the future , because the new technologies will change the lives of people .
I think this , because the new technologies are created by people for improving our habits .
For example , Internet in the next 50 years will be very different , I guess that people will have a chip in our head and they may do many things with your mind like if we need to call other people , we will think about it and we may speak with it .
For other hand , People make other inventions for improving the world and reduce pollution , for example , In this time we have created electric cars or organic food , these things are very useful in future , because we will need to reduce pollution .
Also , People will need to improve medicine to cure diseases and for this , People need to create more inventions to resolve these problems .
Finally , I think that the best change will be in our lifestyle , We will change our clothes , thinking and other things , We will be more dependent and we need more things for our day to day .

Hi , Jenny
Well , as you asked me Jenny , the most brilliant actor than see before is Vin Deasel , it is an excellent professional and he protagonized a great deal of movies like the saga of Fast and Furious , Ridic , Nannies bulletproof and other extras films .
This is one of my favourite actor because , when he is recording a film he assume his role passionately and that is really important for a good actor .
Another of my favourites is Will Smith , he appeared in the well - known film , Men in Black and others excellent films like I am Legend .
This is for me and many people an excellent actor because his personality is extroverty .
So Jenny , here are my two favourites film stars .
I have to go shopping , sorry .
See you

This topic has controversial opinion these days , That everyone should take a year off between leaving school and starting college or university .
I am going to study the topics from both aspects and give my opinion in the matter .
A good percentage of people think that everyone should take a year off between leaving school and start college .
They think that year the student can spend in job to earn money so they can afford their expenses during college .
This way helps them also to explore the job market , some jobs are in great demand compared to others .
Or simply the student can spend this time travelling .
This way help them to get rid of study stress , and to give time to their social life .
Others think that if students take a year off study is unwise .
As return back to study may be difficult .
It is better to finish study first then go for work or having relaxation with travel .
both opinion have their merits .
In my opinion I Think it greatly depend on individual financial situation .
As I you have monetary that can cover your expenses on travel is totally different than if you have to work to cover your expense .
or you just have what is essential for education and university fees .
Transport is very important in our life , because we transport from place to other places .
the development technology and Industry very fast , so the public transport no future ,
Must be Interesting the development transport Even fits the times .

hello , good morning
I enjoy my favorite sport because I like running , playing and go to the forest .
This sport is healthy and good for the body . you should starting this sport for you feel good .
your muscule will be hard .
for this is necessary drink water , eat fruit , vegetables and pasta .
we do n't chould eat sweet and sugar .
if you want to start this sport , you should start running thirty minutes .
Thank you for showing your interest in my village concerns with the environment .
The town , Lahori , has been known for its practices to preserve nature . in our town , we conduct monthly meetings concerning waste management , as well as pesticides .
We are very appreciative of Dr. Manjot Baqri , who has taken upon himself to lead these meetings and educate our village on health problems associated with improper dispose of the waste . the village has built pits to dispose waste .
The fact of using a cart to transport , is essential in life , and that depends on the car you want to buy and save gas .
When you drive you must take precautions at all times because if you can not cause an accident
Link Remember that a car is to make your life easier to transfer and save as a way also to bring security because you go in your car and is less likely to get mugged or something .
Some desventejas may not have the money to maintain it , and they always remember that the car should give you a service and not to him , which is why you always keep it in line with the engine so you do not fail .
One day I visit my friend Jimmy in New York city , he was a young man who was specialist on trains and tourism , he talked about how the citizens and the commuters move from one place to another , he told me that the grand central terminal was the largest terminal of the city , he show me were the landmarks of the big apple were so sightseers could go , he show me the city and we went to different parts first he took me to Columbus circle in the south west corner of central park were there were the most expensive apartments then we went to the lake were the jogging tracks that circle the lake area popular with early morning visitors , then we went to the museum of natural history that was located near the metropolitan museum of art then I got focal on the subway trains so we went to Grand central terminal when we arrive I was amazed to see many people going to work so he told me that it was conveniently for people to use the train because is very fastest and for the government it was a grat economic business then he told me that one of the characteristics of
In the era of technological advancement , everything goes beyond one 's expectation .
There are mobile phone which has a face to face communication ; the transportation driven by solar cell energy .
In addition , the advancement of transportation system which is developed day - by - day performs to the most convenient and the fastest as they can .
Even though the personal car was consumed more and more because of its convenient ; in my opinion , unstoppable transportation development will perform public transport to be more popular than travelling by car .
The number of people in the world is continually increased .
This makes the city be crowded .
Imagine if everyone has individual cars , may we walk on the top of the car to meet neighbour by the next door .
Therefore , public transportation is deemed significant in order to reduce density on the road , the traffic .
In the first paragraph , I 've written that the transportation development will never lose place for public transport .
Firstly , there are a lot of methods to travel ; for example , buses , trolley buses , Metro , BTS , train , ship .
Secondly , public transport improve itself to be more functional and help support people .
For example , comfortable seats , system support for the handicap or physical disability , time capture that help people to know the fix time when the bus come , as well as security support that help people to be more confident to travel .
Lastly , public transportation make you sure to arrive on time .
You do not worried about the traffic jam , or try to find the car park .
All taken into account , the public transport has a much more useful and convenient , both individuals and commercial .
Although the personal car is popular , the public transport is still be valuable for the country

Summer vacation is so desirable that those in school or workplace long for it .
To most students , weekend is essential to them , because they are not allowed to play computer games until the weekends .
In my opinion , weekend not only gives us enough time to take an adequate break but allow us to enrich ourself .
Similarly , summer vacation give us more time to do meaningful things .
Such as visiting museum , seeing touching movies , doing exercises and so on .
Only by constantly do conducting my daily routine can I learn more information and become stronge
In important meetings like UN General Assembly or G77 , many leaders of power countries raise the environmental problems as the most concerned problem in their internal policies .
Disaster on the environment not only cause many problems to human but also to all diversity of life .
As a part of diversity , people , therefore , seek ways to reduce cause and effects of these coming disaster .
Firstly , I sometimes use my mom 's bicycle to university taking part to reduce the carbon dioxide emission from my car .
Riding a bicycle also a kind of eco - friendly transportation .
Next step , I reduce using some of the cosmetic products that provide or made from the materials cause a greenhouse effect .
There are also many related products which harm the environment .

My favourite sport is swimming .
Since I was young I like swimming and when I grew up I told my mum that I want to make competitions .
The first time it 's difficult like other sport because you do n't know and you have to imporve by yourself but if you like it you will find fascinating .
Also I remember my first competitions , I did n't win I was like the 4th but I was n't sad because I though that the next time I will do my best and probably I would win .
I went to swim like 4 hours a week and it was amazing because I improve a lot and right now I 'm one of the best .

If you want to take up swimming I will recommend you to do your best and if you like it you will enjoy it at the same time you make exercise
In the past most of people did not too worry about their healthy .
In those days almost 80% of people have assured feel preocupation about their bodies and their alimentation , for this they convidenced me that they will try improve their habitual alimentation everyday and their will do sport more frequently .
As I the most people we start to do sport because we are stressed and needed go out of our house after a hard day of work or study .

The moment perfect is when you want , in the morning , in the afternoon , in the evening or in the night .
Is thruly that on summer we have to be careful with te hours are too hot and we should avoid .

Dear Ms Ana
Here I come to express my thoughts about what have been happening during these past weeks at the reception of the building .

Becouse of that , sometimes I feel free to ask them what I want and depending on the way they receive my comments I can just let them do the task I asked them without keeping on watching them .
In conclusion I 'd like to offer my aid if anything would be necessary .
Regards .
Myth and fable are always my favorite types of stories , because they can either be easy to understand or extend deeper matters .
Sometimes it is interesting to know a story by discovering their background first , is n't it ?
For example , due to the wide spreading of " The Epic of Gilgamesh " , we all heard something relate to it , but do n't really know about details .
Amount of tradition and legend nowadays somewhat refers its context , such as Homer 's " Odyssey " , the flood mentioned in the Bible , and especially Mesopotamian civilization .
Therefore , I try to find out more information about " The Epic of Gilgamesh " in order to understand it completely .
In conclusion , i hope that Riyadh city will be more interested in traffic jams .
If the government gives attention in improving the streets , decreases using cars , provides other transportation , and controls traffic jams by police , Riyadh will become a great city so the people do n't worry about going out .
I hope this problem will disappear soon .

In the future , this tendency will be continuing more and more specific social networking sites between business and personal life .
In order to this happen , looking out for new social networking sites designed are particular goals .

Having used cars to fulfill our transportation needs within the city limits it is a very good option for many of us , however the necessity of travelling overseas or even outside of our suburban areas might require a different sort of transportation , therefore is where the public transportation should focus on since the long trips taking more than a simple commute in the city would require it .
It has been a popular American tradition for many years now , since the mid-60s that we all use cars owned by private parties in order to meet our needs , hence considered the " modus operandi " ever since .
A new thinking might help to address this issue : transportation itself , perhaps , it is in need of evolution , that might be the use of public transportation , it has proven to be the best manner to get to places which roads and geographical areas might happen to be unknown to the traveller .
Firstly , all people can buy a lot of type of some things in my city for example in the centre of the city we can be souvenirs because this town has got old monuments , theatre and churches .
In north of the city people sell all types of food .
Normally this food are made when people did in the past , although , the best street market is in the west of the city .
On the other hand , you should visit a bookshop in a street marker .
However you can read a book while you can eat and drink some things in the sofa of street .
You must remember that in the center of the city , you can visit the bakeries with the best sweets and bread of world and these sweets are cheaper than in other towns .
Finally , people can know the biggest shopping center of Spain , the situation of this shopping center is in the national street 445 in west of the city .
You can see modern clothes while you eat in a restaurant and you can take photos with a tv star , because they buy in this shopping center and you feel a star , because you see a famous person and you think that you are in a film .
The movie I decided to review for you is thriller called The destiny .
The plot of movie is set in a small town where everything has its own eyes and because of that you must be aware of your behaviour .
All it begin when daughter will come to visit her mother and her step father .
What I liked most was that you think you know what is going to happen but for your surprise it always turns up for something unexcepted .
Despite the fact that there is n't any holywood star all the characters are played very believable and some scenes wo n't let you sleep .
Even the scenery is not based on real story it will makes you think about accidents happening around you .
There is n't anything special what I dislike maybe except for the music which was used there .
Sometimes I felt that the background songs do n't match with what was happening but after all you are in expectations of next step so you would n't mind it .
I highly recommend this movie to everyone who wants to see happening unpredictable situations and likes the feeling of unknown .
Hi Isabel ,

In toward to modernization of life and technology the people belief in different perspective about way of life , but majority of ones is totally utopic .
Everyone wants a particular objects and individual life , as an egoistic human being ; however the realm world hasn't capacity to support these ideas .
Actually , we have a lot of problem with traffic : lots of cars in the railway and it do n't running ; the number of cars in the street cause a dirty pollution ; crawded railways causes a later destination .
In the biggest cities around the world the traffic nonstop and increase every day .
We descovery , in this perspective , special deseases by traffic : stress , violence , pollution , insecurity , so on .
For this reason , I believe that in the future we will return to use a green combuster and public transport .
If the public transport will be by higher quality , faster and fewer rates , majority of citizens will be prefer : is more calm to relax and read a newpaper or a magazine during the way in a collective transport than an indiivdual one ; moreover , the time spend up to go and came back will be reduced , because it promotes less car in the railway .
Thus , in the future , public transport will be more interesting than particular and individual transport .
Last month , my friend came to Korea and visited me .
In the morning We went to Ocean Park , we saw dolphin , cat , horse and many animals .In the afternoon we went to play rollar coatser , I screamed on top of voice and called for help .Actually I hate playing rollar coster .We played mind train , punch and a lot of games .At the end of the day I was just like running out of gas , because I was too tired to walk any further .
Last day , I gave her a photo that was our first hang out and we hugged each other , she gave me a present and called me to keep it for her .
Nowadays , students have a lot of various form of education . They may not only learn in school but also through the Internet .
It has both advantages and disadavantages .
The main advantage of learning per Internet is time saving .
When we attend a school we often waste time on buses which we may intend to studying .
In case of Internet learning we can oneself set hours of learning .
Also , possibility of learning at home is a big advantage , especially for people who prefer peace and silence .
Then it 's better to concentrate of learning and we do n't feel any pressure or stress connected with asking and tests .
On the other hand , through the Internet learning on a long term we could feel bored or lonely , School gives opportunity of learning in group when students may help each other and resolve problems .
Another disadvantage of learning per Internet can be issue with Internet connection .
It not always work correctly .
A mind that lost it .
Malcolm Young is a guitarist that with his brother founded the rock band : AC / DC .
He never has been the most famous guitarist in the world , He was just one more guitar player .
He has lived behind the shadow of his brother , the leader guitar and one of the most important guitarist .
However he never has thought in this like a problem .
He just do his job , play guitar and sing like a second voice .
But if you research about what he has done for ACDC , you realize that he was an important man .
A lot of AC / DC 's songs were written and composed by himself .
He has been the AC / DC 's mind .
But Why I did this article about someone who looks like a simple guitarist , the reason is just one , the life , this man who one day just disapper from the fanactics ' eye .
On April 2014 he was unable to do performans .
On sepmtember 2014 , a note was realized and published in AC / DC 's webpage , the note said : " Malcolm is taking a break from the band due to ill health " .
But the true was worse , Malcolm has had an illness since 2014 and daily he is worse .
Dementia is the illness .
The dementia is an illness that affect the brain , people 's memory were lost , Malcolm do n't remember who is the people surround him .
Around a year ago , a video was made by Brazilian radio .
The video show us how dementia sufferers ' reaction to listing ACDC 's music .
in the end we read a sentences : " Although you might someday forget about the world , the world will never forget you , Malcolm , "
Live you only have a life , today , perhaps tomorrow you lost all .
My name is samy .
I'm 22 years old Egyptian .
When I was young , I enjoyed playing basketball .
I thought that it 's the best sport ever .
It made me fit and strong .
It taught me the meanings of teamwork and leadership .
I Kept playing basketball 4 years continuously till I joined the secondary school .
My advice to anyone starting basketball is to never giving up and always keep playing till the last minute .
We are not alone . We live with people whome are family for us .
Relationship can be very different ?
from the best to the worst .
But sometimes we start to call our sisters and brother our enemy , without the reason .
Who brink up ?
Who care about us ?
Who try to make us happy ?
Our enemy ?
Of course no .
Our family is people who will love us , do n't look on situations and who we are .
We are always small and careless children for our parents , small and foolish for our elder brothers and sisters .
And i can clearly say that they are our friend . We are part of them and they are part of us .
So we need to stand together .
Television and other things invented by tecnhology are part of our lifes .
I think every family has got a television in own home and for example I have 4 televions in mine .
For me television has advantages and disadvantages .
It 's important if we want to know news of our country or world 's news .
There are a lot of interesting tv programs where we can learn something and there are also intriging television programs .
These are advantages but we can have also disadvantages from them .
For example we can become addicted to our television .
It is not the best thing for our eyesight and our helth .
In general I think our technology is not the best thing for our health and tv and other similar things are responsable for our problems with helth and eyesight .
So television has positive and negative aspects and it 's up to us how to behave with it .
As keep our mind good and healthy we need to spend our some times in sport .
I like cricket is the best among all of these sports cricket is a good mind refreshing game

After calling the ambulance , he waited outside his car someone who could help you .

He thought that he must do something or his friend could die .
They had a car accident , and fortunately he had n't injury but his friend Sam was fainted .
He tried to stop some cars that passed through the street , but it was useless .
The ambulance arrived .
Sam was visited but beside the scary he had only some bruises .

My favourite sports are cycling and swimming .
Swimming is very excited .
Although you do n't know how to swim , you would love it .
In Hong Kong , it is very hot in summer .
There are many swimming pools in Hong Kong people love to swim with their families , friends or their children .
People in Hong Kong love to go cycling in holidays , too .
Some people used to do cycling as relaxing .
People like cycling alone the river .
Doing sport is very important in our lives . We need to do more sports to make us healthy .

When I started to study here in Australia . I have been found the difference of curriculum in my home country .
It is really crucial for me to adopt their way of teaching at this time .
In my home country , when I was in the University it has a little bit easy for me to follow the educational policies .
The learning style is a traditional learning that is usual thing in my country .
In addition , the type of examination is more on memorization , that I can use my own language that help me to understand it easier .
" In particular , many international students are too teacher dependent on uncritical of material that have been thought , prone to role memorization , they misunderstand the cardinal sin of plagiarism , and lack of knowledge of the genres of academic writing " .
In contrast , to my present learning , it is precisely crucial .
The academic style is more on critical thinking , it is hardy to cope up , because I need to understand it using their language .
Clearly , multiple factors have had major influence or the nature of the student population , attending universities and now this shift affects , and is affected by university policy and practiced are important issue .
As an international learner , I embraced these changes in my learning strategies , primarily because these new learning strategies of academic style significant for my future course .
It has challenged me to adapt in a Universal approach to learning style back in my country .

It 's a mystery story with a moral , because for surprise of reader , the director was the drug dealer that produced the drug inside the classes .
The moral is about the students do n't be naïve and take care of unscrupulous men that sell drugs .

I have a dream to continue my study until Phd .
However , I think that it is not an easy thing to be achieved because of the limitation about information of scholarship .
In addition , I work as civil servant who should follow the government rule .
Actually , I do n't give up and always looking for the opportunities .
In my opinion , education is a way to improve our life quality .
In other words , it can change our paradigm and mindset also into better perspectives .
In the broader capacity , it can help my nation 's position in the world perspective .
Therefore , I do not try to erase my ambition .
Everything is possible as long as we have effort .
travelling is an essential in everybody 's life .
Although the number of cars are increasing day by day , however most of the people traveled through the public transport .Their limited income restrict them to buy cars .
also the main drawback of cars is the environmental pollution .
Therefore public transport has its own importance .
In order to avoid the environmental pollution , people should use the public transport that will not only help to reduce the pollution but also the extra expenditures for the petrol .
government should focus for the improvement of public transport and must discourage the individual cars .

Hello Jo .
Good I am going to throw a hand .
My advice to travel for Spain is that there are several types of transport but the most economic is the public , most expensive transport can be the taxi , for example .
But , you can travel by plane , it is not very expensive .
My advice of finding work , is a bit complicate because nowadays there are a lot of people without work .
But you can been lucky because the summer is very near and the work increase .
Your you can find work , since you have the learned English , in a bar , in a hotel , etc .
Well , I wish the best thing you and that you find work .
Good luck

Dear Sir ,
I 'm writing this letter to tell you about my work last summer at my local cinema .
I liked my work there so much .
My work was about reserving tickets for the customers .
It seemed like a simple job to me , but it was also a very stressful job at rush times .
In the morning , we had small groups of people and the rush times started in the evening .
I am looking forward to hear from you about how did you spend your summer .
Sincerely ,
Gehad
Hi , My name is Gabriela Cordeiro Magalhaes ... I have thirteen years old .
I like playing games and read .
I 'm from Brazil .
My best friend is Jennifer Giordano , she 's Pretty and Smart .
I will recommend Huang Ji Huang to celebrate our farewell dinner .
Huang Ji Huang is located in popular district in North Jakarta which many people call it PIK .
This is China - based chain that is recently opened .
This restaurant has many awards in China before it opened in Jakarta .
The place of Huang Ji Huang is pretty big if you compared with the other restaurants in PIK .
The place is provided private room and karaoke room in one place .
Besides that the public room is also clean and comfortable , but I recommend you to choose private room to support our farewell dinner .
The waiters who worked here are kind and helpful , they serve the customers kindly and always explain the menu clearly , they are capable make their customer satisfied with the service .
Huang ji huang specialized in the stew pots menu , which will take you to enjoy an authentic Chinese food .
You can order packages menu that Huang Ji Huang offered or you can also choose the ingredients that you want for your stew pot but you must choose 3 until 5 ingredients .
Huang Ji Huang has 5 kinds of sauce which can give your stew pot become tasteful , and one of them is Mala Sauce .
Mala Sauce is a spicy flavor and it is very authentic and you will rarely find this taste in another restaurant .
But if you do not like spicy you can also try the Honey Sauce .
After all the food is very tempted to try and the size portion is big enough to share with 3 or 4 people .
The price is cheap if you compare it with the service and taste from the food .
Having farewell dinner here is worth the money .
Every month Huang Ji Huang always make a special offer from their cutomer , and for this month Huang Ji Huang will give 20% discount for customer who spend 500 IDR above , for a complete informatioj you can check it on the website or call the restaurant .
And I highly recommend you to make a reservation first if you decided to hold our dinner here , because this place is always crowded and we also need a private room .
I used all of the things except two .
I did n't have the Internet when I was child .
And also we could n't choose programmes .
I played in the street and walked to school alone .
I'm thinking what kind if things were more dangerous for me?It was so dangerous when my friends and I swam in the Tobol river .
We jumped into the water and caught crayfish .
When I remember that moment I am exciting .
I guess everychild want to investigate the world .
We have to help them , to show and explain .
What kind of risks they can get if to do that .
Nuclear energy is one of most important source to generate energy and heat for the people in the world .
The countries diurnal attempts to develop the industry of nuclear to produce more power .
There are many views of using the nuclear power .
Some people guess the nuclear power has a great value to produce power instead of the fossil fuels such as : coals and oil which are Not renewable energy .
Moreover , they think that controlling the pollution is possible .
Whereas .
The serious side of the nuclear power is the dangerous weapons that the countries try to own , threat the peace in the world .
These kinds of weapons do not kill one or ten but destroy a large town completely .
In my opinion using the nuclear power is important with the great development in the humans life.the countries have to establish this energy and other sources to secure the power for people .

My favourite way to travel is by plane because you are quickly in another country .
By plany you rarely have problems with your luggage .
By train you did n't will have always place for your luggage .
By plane you can give your luggage at the check - in or you can take the hand luggage with you . you can be always sure that you will find a place for your luggage .
Another reason why travel by plane is my favourite is because it is more comfortable to sleep except you have a loud person close to you .
That can be annoyand .
I think travel by boat is one of the baddest ways to travel when you are seasick .
Then you must travel by train or by plane .
BIG FISH ,
A VERY GOOD RESTAURANT WHOSE SPECIALITY IS " TAPAS "
Eating " tapas " is a very popular way of having a meal in Spain .
If you are not very hungry .
You can eat small pieces of different dishes and to have dinner or lunch inexpensively .
For more than thirty year in Nerja has been openend every day " Big Fish " a traditional restaurant with a typical cook of the coast of Málaga .
With your drink the first portion is on the house .
If you pay between one and three euros you can choose little dishes of fresh fish and different types of salads .
The portion of prawns is very famous as octopus salad , which is known by everyone .
The service is very organised and fast , although it might be in high season you would not have to wait a long time .
This restaurant only has a little problem .
You can eat " tapas " at the counter or in small tables near the bar .
The rest of the diningroom is exclusive by eating meals .
Discussions about genetic manipulation become strong when a specific area is mentioned : genetically modified food or GM food .

Improve human nutrition and agriculture conditions are arguments of those who are in favour of manipulation .
In the first quarter , we can see that sales rose , in the second quarter , sales went up but in the third quarter , sales were unchanged .
In conclusion , we can see that sales went up every time except the third quarter that it were unchanged .
this is good , because sales mever went down .
My favourite sport is football , I love it .
It is the most popular sport in the world .
I enjoy play it , particularly because it is a competitive sport and because you play with a team and not alone , and this for me is really important .
The thing I like best in football is play it , but I also like watching it , intact I am a fan of the team Lazio .
Some people think that the football is a bad thing because the footballer are all stupid and the fans are all violent and disrespectful , but it is n't like it .
Ok there are some fans who are n't good people but the most important associations of football are trying to stop they and to abolish all bad things in football .
For all the people I advise to start to play or watching football because for me it is a very good sport , but you can play a good football only if you really like it , because first football is fun .
As every year the twenty three of April , day of book , in my school all the student of fifth and sixth of primary do short story competition and the winner have a gift .
the gifts usually are a book and a ticket for the theme park in Madrid , and the children who have participated win a book .
Always the director of my school , called Michael , is who organizes this event for that the children have fun writing his shorts stories .
But this year , Michael is organizes very evil because he does n't enough books for all children and a lot of they had n't gift , so Michel had closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
I think my town really take care of the environment , because there are a lot of parkｓ in this town and these are very clean .
However some people are not care of environment that mean some people throw garbage away in the park .
I think almost everyone loves parks because a lot of people go to the park and having lunch , picnic , excersise , nap etc .
I think after eat something at the park then clean themselves is good .
Even though do not everyone doing that , so how much public office is care of environment is important and this town is care of that a lot .
Every morning some peasons are coming park and cleaned that makes feel really thanksgratitude .
When I am walking around here I can see a lot of beautiful gardens and roads are clean so I think many population are care of town as well .
There are many sports grounds for example tennis cort , football grounds and play equipment for child so I think my town takes care of environment that makes everyone will be able to best condition in both mind and body long time .
Espesialy there are a lot of greens these makes good health .
However someone have to take care of them .
The town have to do that and I think in England there are so many greens all around , so a lot of people take care of these that makes good environment .
After I have been to live in England with my family I have goton the feel very much indeed .
pain and gain
This movie is bases quote on quote on a " true story " buts obviously director michael bay know for the transformers franchise puts a lot of hollywood into this movie , its about a bodybuilder named daniel lugo who decides to kidnap a rich guy and make him sign away all of his properties , which obviously its not a great plan that backfires on him , and eventualy police get him .
Its a great funny movie especially for someone like me who enjoys going to the gym and lifting some weights .
Hi Julie ,
thank you for your present .
I love the T - shirt that you gave me for my birthday .
It is a very beautiful T because -shirt I like the colour and the pattern .
My day in London
I went to London in April .
It was pretty warm .
My family and I got a great feeling as we landed in London .
We saw a lot of sights like the Big Ben , which is the biggest clock in the world and the London Eye .
To got to the Big Ben we took the underground , but to get to the London Eye a red bus .
After 3 days we went home .
I forgot to tell you something about homeless people .
A lot of people are homeless , which is sad , but maybe we can change it .
Sport is very important for every one .
Old and young are benefit from sports .
My favourite sport is volleyball .
I like it very much . I practise it in the club .
I play it with my companions .
It makes my body healthy and strong .
when you score alot of points , you will win the match .
Genarlly sports is growing our mind continously .
I practise it with my friends .
I enjoy playing it alone or with my friends .
my parents always support me to play what like and
enjoy .
It make me lose weight easily without doing any effort .
I do n't find any difficulty in doing it .
My favourite sport is basketball .
Usually I only play basketball in school .
We play by teams or each one alone .
Of course we do n't have 2 million balls for each student no we share with each other .
Also , not all the school play in one time no every section have time to play in .
In school I always play with friends never played alone and always my friends and I wins .
Last time I played when won 14 by 5 .
do you know do I enjoy my sport I will tell you why because when you play you have fun and interested .
My advice for people who is starting this sport is to repeat playing until they get it .
My favourite soap opera is " Friends " . I remember to watching it at home at the age of twelve and laughing out lous with my brother .
I still watch it on Saturdays and I really enjoy it !
My favoutite character is Joey , who is a silly innocent man .
He live with Chandler , opposite Monica and Rachel 's flat .
It is very difficult to deny the importance of family in our life , definitely families play an essential role community structure .According to the experts we ca n't create successful society without creative families , and one another specific part of your life is a good partners surrounding your daily activities .
One of the main advantage of family is the recogniton you have been given in specific age , children required special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family .For instance , homeless children are more likely to fail in their education , job and adapt to society .
Consequently , they probably fail to experience from their live .
Moreover , families take an essential part in protect their members from bad atmosphere , and it probably reflect on their perfotmance toward country .leading to effictive , creative and useful civilians .
the last film I wachd was " the oders " by it is a horror / suspense movie , I was really scared .
It is about a family ( the mother and her two children nicholas and anne ) , the mother is crazy and thinks her children are allergic to the lightin general .
so the did n't come outside in the day , and in a room it could not be more than a candle at a time , it had to be always dark in the house .
Strange things happen in the house , they are " intruders " in the house , anne saw many times someone called victor who " play 's "
and the mother thinks she is lyeing but after a while she believe her and started searching for the intruders .
At the end theintruders turn out to be ghosts that

Public transportation
I think nowadays is more common that people use their car for their normal activities , but the statement that there ir no future for public transportation it is not completely true , I think that a lot of people use public transportation because it is cheaper and some people do n't have enough money to buy a car .
Another reason is that here in Mexico , in some cities you ca n't use your car in specific days , so if you do not have another car , you have to use public transportation .
Well , my college has been provide an organization called Enactus .
I 'm a member on it and its goal that improve the positivity of our society by setting projects serves many people who really needs our help .
So , we actually done 8 projects since i came in and i had a good feeling through helping other people .
we interned 2 national Competitions in 2 years and won second place on one of our projects and gained 2 leagues on other ones .
we made our university proud plus helping people .
Now , we are over 180 members in this organization and getting increase .
We need more of this organization cross the world and there is a lot of students ready for help and wishing for a chance to make our society a better place .
Nowadays , Ways of live have being Changing in many aspects .
Does why , is easy to believe that if things continue with this rhythm and transforming everything , in a closer future of 50 years everything is gon na be completely knew and different .
In the past , people were used to live the instant without concerning about the future .
Lives of everybody were the same and just some of them thought that what they were doing in that moment would have consequences in the future .
For that , everything were kind of similar and static for many years .
But then industrialization comes and with that , the technology , so ways of life 's started to change and everything start to go faster .
As I told you before because of the technology many things has become able in less time , and with the pass of the years this tend to increase .
For example , sharing knowledge and experiences allows that everybody can do or apply things and develops faster .
Also allows that researches can be share easily or for example you can get information about environmental problems that can affect you as we 'll so you can react faster and make some changes .
Another example of why lives are gon na changed completely in 50 years is because also that connection between others cultures make People concern more about her own health , the expectations of life and the way they want to live it , because everyday will be easier to see how much are we hearting the earth so we will see faster the impacts that this brings to our life .
As a result we will be need to change fast , to try to fix what we broke and star to rebuild in order to have that future or health that we dream of .
Least but no less , family perception , has being changed and for that time everything will be different because will be the effect of the decisions that women are making right now about having kinds .
They are tending to work as much as men 's , so is hard to have time for building a family or even some times is hard too , thinking about getting married .
So that , maybe would n't be young force worker in 50 years and people will spend all their time and money in their hobbies , sports , self care and traveling .

This premonition can not hold more true .
Traveling in public transport can be cumbersome and quite eventful .
Talk of getting to meet strangers who may turn out to be thiefs .
That is why i feel traveling by your own car is the best things that can happen to one person .
You get the convenience of traveling at your own pace and stopping when you please .
Someone has suggested putting warnings on some types of food and drink .
This suggestion is controversial .
On the one hand society become increasingly fat and kinds of warnings could be useful to remind them to eat clean .
On the other hand it 's hard to implement this idea .
The companies who produce products with harmful ingedients are very mighty so that this suggestion is very hard to enforce .
The example on cigarette packets shows that warnings like this could be useful .
the aim of this report is to provide assessment to relocate the current canteen of the campus to a location more accessible for all the students , hence it will hopefully prove both , the profitability of the canteen and the relevant role it plays for all the students in the campus .
One day , a man called Jonas was standing in front of a mountain when he saw a big bird of prey .
He was worried that the bird charged him , so the man seeks refuge and goes in a cavern .
Suddenly he understands that he has heard a noise so he decides to stay in the cavern away from danger .
It 's the day after and Jonas has put up all night in the cavern and at cold .
At dawn the man goes out from the cavern and look at the sky to see if there was the bird of prey .
Jonas does n't see the bird and think that the predatory had gone away , during the night .
So he decides to get home .

He decided to take the penknife that he had in his bag , and he is successful in kill the bird of prey .
After two long day Jonas get home safe and sound and tell everything about his experience .
As all of us know that today 's generation prefers everything to be their own .
An in the process of owning we have moving so ahead that a day will be there when we will strongly claim that public transport does not have any future .
It will automatically diminish its presence .
As our country is developing there will days were each and every individual will be self reliant and would definitely prefer having their own vehicle to commute from one distance to the other .

One of the things that I feel stressed are the finals exams , because I have to study for all the classes and sometimes I am very confused with my notes .

Sometimes I trust a lot and I have a bad grades so I feel depressed .
Nowadays the public transporte is n't hardly necessary for our life .
However , a lot cities have a problem about traffic , cause of this trouble that citizen do n't use public transporte such as autobus , taxi , or even metro .
Consequently , gorvernment start to support and take care of the public transporte .
Moreover it 's not only traffic 's problem but also bad condition .
Much toxic and exhaust flow to air .
How can we recover the pubilc transporte .
People are unpleasant because all of them have bad quality , so government ought to update new technology which protects the environment .
Now , the car price is very low 's cost so it very easy to buy a car .
The recenty years before , a family had only one car but today we have a car for ourselves .
Restaurant review
This restaurant is excellent !
It 's not very expensive and there are lots of choices on the menu .
Waiters are always smiling and they are very nice .
They wear black and white clothing like the decoration of the etablissment .
It is located in the city centre next to a big fountain .
They open from 11 am to 14 pm and from 8 pm to 10 pm .
And for spring and summer they open a beautiful and large terrace .
The atmosphere is very friendly .
The food is excellent and copious .
The baking of the meat is excellent .
The wait is not long , only a few minutes .
This restaurant should be the best for our class .
The best place for young people in our area is without doubt the countryside with the lake .
Here they can do many kinds of sport : swimming , sailing , surfing , kiting , rowing and many others .
At least they can meet other folks and relax , have a sunbathe and listen to the music .
In the summer around the lake are so many concerts so you have the difficulty finding the right one .
Luckily the scouls are closed per ten weeks , so the young girls and boys have much time to spend the
leisure time together .
in modern day there is very little public transpotr are used , ganeral public prefer much faster and conveninece ways of traveling around.though the pulic transport are used in mager citys to avoied traffic conjustion , it is wlidly reconizge that public transport are eco friendly .
public transport is used by many people around the world , including me .
Some public transports as trains do not contaminate as cars or motorbikes .
Many people said that public transport is not confortable , that s true , from my point of view bus is not so unconfortable .
Many people like going by car , but it pollute a lot more than going by public transort.public transport is cheaper than buying a car or motorbike , it also contamiate less than these .
Public transport is also used by childrens like me who want to go to school , high school or to the univerity .
Finally , I think public transport has a very good future , because it has very good advantages but also some little disadvantages , it 's also very usefull for some people .
In my opinion public transport souldn't dissapear .
I like to spend time cute little kids and cooking is my favourite hobby .
In the evening I would like to spend some time with those kids by organising some indoor and outdoor games for them .
I would feel more energtic throughout the day If I have some busy or tight scheduled work , I have come across your advertisement For this job and I really think that I would suit this job in every aspect because I have a friendly move with people in and around me . I would be pleased to know for your positive reply .
My town tries to take care of the environment but sometimes it is not possible .
Some people do n't have any conscience of the need of good environment .
Neither they do n't seem to take care nature and all around it .
For instance , My town have a lot of mountains with big forests , tall trees and many types of animals or plants .
However , that is n't protected by government and its institutions .
Local Parliament haven't regulated principles or rules of the environment , then ecosystems have been destroyed , rivers are contaminate and pollution had reised inside my town .
Besides , my town 's institutions have allowed that some foreign enterprises or corporations could to take our own resources without demand that they be careful with environment .
This is clearly a symptom of how inside my town does n't care any element of the environment .
Nevertheless , in the last decade some neighborhoods have taken conscience on their context .
In this way , we can to see inside them that their population have so much control and they know that affect them .
Good management of the rubbish is a new inclination in many neighborhoods of my town .
Recycle plastic , paper , cardboard etc , by poblation of the most important neighborhoods of my town is a way to improve the environment .
My favourite sport is box because it 's the only sport that can relax me .
In my opinion this sport teaches to mature because in addition to set up the person physically , it instructs the mind .
I begin this sport for 2 years ago .
My brother was win so much fight and when i saw him proud i want to try that .
I do n't know what i can tell .
Thank you goodbye .
Must people prefer large colleges more than small colleges for many advantages .
First , the majors offer numerous and diverse .
It has a lot of faculty members .
It gives the students the freedom to choose his major and the teachers .
In addition , it has a lot of facilities that serve students like kindergarten that takes care of children these employees , university housing , hospital the student of medicine can be application in it and it serves the people too , and a big library has many books in various languages .
Besides that it availability some services like transporting for students and faculty , some restaurants , and mini market .
In addition , the location of large college is clear and the center at the city , so that easily accessible .
In the end , large colleges admit largest number of students , so the student may do establishing friendships more from different nationalities , also it serves the community by graduating many students in various majors .
Once upon a time there was a boy his name is Michael .
He had a very beautiful brown hair , Green eyes , and perfect smile .
Michael loves to play football all the time .
Someday he woke up early at the morning he go out for playing football before school , when he 's playing he saw something running very fast and go away .
He 's back home for getting ready for school when he 's try to forget what he saw , but he ca n't .
after school he did n't go to his home directly to check if what he saw at the morning was real or not , but he did n't find anything .
Next day he woke up early too not to play football but to take a look if this stranger will come back this morning . and he saw it again .
he jump from his bed to the street and walk to his way to see what he did every morning.when he walk after the stranger man he notice that he stopped in every trash in the street to take a look and go to the next one , and guess what he saw Michael and run away also Michael was afraid .
The stranger was looking for a food in the street to take it to his family .
Hi Michael ,
I just got back from a school trip to London .
It was very cool .
we visited the Tower of London , Buckingham Palace and the wax museum .
I liked the most in a wax museum .
He puts them on Marie Tussaud in 1835 .
There are statues of famous people from different walks of life made of wax . when you were last on a school trip ? where it was and what you have seen ?

My favorite sport is basketball .
I like it very much .
Almost each weekend , I 'll go to the playground to play basketball with my classmates .
And that 's my happiest time .
Further more , I watch TV of NBA matches each day .
I am quite interested with how the stars are going on .
Insufficient ESP teaching skills made teachers pull back to general English .
This becomes the concern of the employers since it may impact on the students ' learning outcomes .
This should also become the ED UMM commitment .
FILM : LUCY ( 2014 )
TThe plot of this film is about a 25 naive woman that was living and studying in Taiwan and one night went out for clubbing and met a nutter guy that involved her in a seedy drug smuggling issue with a Corean criminal band that forced her to be a mule drug .
A new substance , called CPH4 , bound to be distributed around Europe and the United States by which plenty bag was set into her stomach having an illegal clinical surgery .
But everything became out of control for the criminals when one of her captors kicked on her abdomen , the substance spilles through her body and she begins to experience a different state of consciousness in which she dizzily enhanced her IQ from 2% to almost 100% of his capacity .
During this time she contacts Samuel Norma , PhD Professor of University , to ask him what happens if a person reaches the 100% of his mental activity or IQ .
She 'll end up knowing the answer .
It is a gripping film , starring by Scarlett Johanson and Morgan Freeman in a quite good playing , that will you keep tense until the last scene and does n't leave you feel unpasible .
Nowadays people are using own cars instead of public transport , this effect is more obvious in big cities where the price of public transport cost more than small cities .
Pople are getting used to drive with their own car , it provides more confortability , and is more practical .
You can use it whenever you want , and it 's not necessary make a long queues at metro or bus stations .
The government are opposing to invest in public infraestructures , because the benefits are lower every year .
They are preferring to invest in public roads and motorways .
The impact of this fact has a huge consequences in the climate effect , in the futre the global pollution will increase according to the level of the cars .
The travelling by car it 's very bad .
With the public transport we protected the environment .
The pollutes it 's a global problem .
If we will travel by car have more pollutes that with public transport .
Otherwise , the public transport pollutes less that the car but the car it 's very comfortable and not be hour hard .
With the car I feel more free as I do n't depend to other people for move to the site .
I believe that in the future all transport will be with the public transport or least with massive transport .
The actual system is not possible stand long time .
Recently I saw the trailer of the film about vampires .
The film is called ' The Vampire Diaries ' .
It is about two men and one woman .
The girl is 18 years old and men ( as it later turns out ) are vampires and they have over 100 years .
One of vampires decides to return to high school .
There he meets a girl .
He falls in love in her .
They are together .
Then there is the older brother of the boy ( vampire ) and also falls in love in her .
All the action takes place in Mystic Falls .
This trailer I like and I think that the film would be cool .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
He had to buy a present for his girlfriend 's birthday but it was Sunday and all stores were closed so he had to found a solution .
A few hours , he was walking by a garden , and suddenly , he saw the most beautiful flowers that he has ever seen , so he picked them up .
However , flowers were n't enough so he decided to think in anything else .
Several hours later , he found an open sweet shop and he bought some bonbons for her .
Finally , he had found the present and before the end of the day he ran quickly to his girlfriend 's house .
If you do n't want to pass this situation , you must always do things with time .
In my thougths , i have the opinion the public transport is better to the enviroment because going in the public transport reduce the CO2 emissions and take out traffic from the streets .
Reducing the rush hours in the main hours cause a CO2 reduction in the air .
it is a true statement about cars , travelling by car is so much more convenient and the new tecnologies apply to the
People should take less fast food and do regular exercises for maintaining a hgealthy life .
People tend to pick the junk foods as they do not get enough time for cooking at home .
Many of us do not get enough time in the morning , to prepare our lunch for the office .
Easy availability is also tempting us for fast foods .
University education is good for the students but they also need to learn industry specific skills .
Students , for example learn many theories , which may not be required at their place of work .
New skills like analytics and data management are in demand .
In my opinion , what is expected is a new role for teachers but not their disappearance from classrooms .
At university level , availability of IT training , software and manuals provide an ever accessible source of information , that otherwise would not be at hand .
For example , India has high rate of unemployment , hunger , poverty which leads to an immense embrassment of being Indian .
Nowadays internet represents the whole knowledge that people have collected over the centures .
So it provides a lot of interesting information , one of which are about how works different machines what can be found at www.howstuffworks.com .
Also ' internet ' in our days helps to get information all over the world , and if you wish to get involved then go to the www.bbc.co.uk.These sites are free way to find most adequate information about actual events both in society and technical life .
One day i decide o buy news paper .
When i was arrived at home , i was started to read the news paper , so i found from there The International Student Magazine have to organize a short story competition , and I decide to call Michael to tell him about this contest .
Michael was told me he was knew about this contest and at that moment he want to call me to ask , if I am able to came with him at that contest .
After I decided to go with him at the contest , I was thinking to go at that contest next year to participate and win that contest , so this year I was wondering how is the program .
When we were arrived there , the emotions started to appear so definitely it was time to drink a hot coffee , before the contest is started .
I was wondering if Michael pass that exam .
I was waiting for Michael less then an hour , so I started to have a lot of emotions .
After Michael was opened the door from the classroom , I was saw in his eyes something strange .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
The doorbell rang .
When I opened the door imagine my surprised by what I saw .
It was awesome !
One Direction was in front of my door !
I could n't believe in my eyes ...
It was weird that Niall was missing .
Then , I asked them why he was n't with them and they told me : " We are on our tour in America and were singing at our concert in New York City .
When we came back in our dressing room , " Golem " waited for us .
" Golem " as we all know , are magical creatures , made from mud and having black rocks for the eyes , which can be brought to life by a incantation .
So , we were trying to save time until we managed to escape , but Niall did n't make it to escape , as they caught him when he stumbled and fell down .
Now , " Golem " hold him hostage in their cave , which is hidden somewhere in Los Angeles . "
I looked at them trying to think of something to do and then I said : " Come on boys , WE are going to SAVE Niall ! ! ! ! "
We took all we needed and started the searching for Niall ... We went in all caves in Los Angeles , but we could n't found them .
One night , which we were sleeping in our car , by mistake the car started to move and we woke up in a huge cave , out of Los Angeles .
I could n't believe in my eyes , we found Niall .
Then , we got out of our car and save Niall , after we were fighting with " Golem " and came back home .
Recently , an increasing number of people try to travel by car for convenient .
In my opinion , public transport will still exist in the society .
There are three main reasons for supporting my idea .
Firstly , for the long - distance , the car is not as convenient as airport .
for example , if you go to another city by car , you may spent more than two days on the way .
On the contrary , airport just cost your two hours , and you can go to your destination .
The time spending of taking airport is lower than taking car .
Secondly , consuming car is not a normal thing for part of developing or undeveloped country .
The fee of buying car and fuel oil is expensive for poor people .
Thus , it is important to use public transport because it is much cheaper than private car , and everyone can consume .
Thirdly , the global warming is a serious issue for human who live in the earth .
Air pollution is the main causes for global warming .
The great number of using private car leads to higher level of air pollution , and the public transport is one of the best solutions for decreasing the air pollution .
To sum up , there are numerous benefits to use public transport , and it will not disappear .
Nowadays public transportation is included almost all around the planet , We can admit that the transport revolution has been plave in the last century but due to the globalization and technological development , the transport sector is always in a continuos transformation :
In the other hand we must remarque how the plane sector has been grown , currently is the most common way of transport for going away and that 's also means than the shipping factory has decreaced deeply , in order to let the plane market blomm .
Talking about local transport , we have a lot of choisses like cars , motorbikes , busses , train but also as we were talking about , planes .
According to the information donne , the most used is the car thus most of the families has one , but the public transportation is getting more and more common for those ones who want to preserv the planet and develop other alternatives more respectfully with the planet .
As we were talking , the new ecological movement is every time more powerful and charismatic , due to that , bikes are also increasing their role in the new age , there are also linked to the new fashion way to be hipster .
In conclusion , we are assisting to a new tend in transport , every time , they are faster and more developer , with the latest technology included but at the oppossite case , we find also a contradiction , as we found an other trend for the tradictional transport which avoid the pollution in order to respect the Earth
I agree that communiting by car is easier and faster than most of the public transportation ; however , there are serious problems come after it ; the amount of vehicles on the roads keep increase and make congestion and pollution which are far more severe than the inconvenience causing by public transportation .
Thus , I think the future for public transportation will be more proferous .
Dear Jo
Many thanks for your message ,
when you can , you call me .
Then if you want we could go to the restaurant of the city
later if you want we could fiand a job for three months , in my opinion a good job for three months I could be the waiter because the waiter get much money in the three months of the summer .
also I believe that a good job could be lifeguard , because in summer the people go to the beach and they need lifeguard .
If I were you I would choose lifeguard because the lifeguard earn much money than the waiters .
If you want we could go to the capital city of my country , we will go by the car because the car is cheaper than the bus or train , we could eat in the famous restaurant of the city or we could go to the cinema also if you want I could visit the medieval wall .
I am looking forward to see you
best wishes

Mobile phones are most important thing in our daily lifeis the most effective method for instantaneous communication .
However the extensive use of mobiles create lot of problems .
This essay evaluates whether its demerits outweigh its merits .
To begin with now a days people are addicted to mobiles.for example young people wasting their valuable time in mobiles .
Moreover their concentration is reduced .
Another serious problem is people are creating relationships with an unknown person and can leads to several issues including crimes .
To sum up let people aware about the drawbacks of phones and use it wisely .
Uncertain future for Public Transport
Public transport is generally is the transport system provided by government for the general people .
These transport includes buses , trains & boats etc .
People of all classes can use this .
This facility helps the general people in saving their money because usually these transport are the less costly .
My favourite kind of sport is horse riding .
The first time when I ride on the horse I was 14 and since that time I enjoy it very much .
When I ride on the horse I feel myself much better and forget all of my problems .
Riding the horse gives me a state of freedom .
I think that the horse is a kind and clever animal .
If you want to start to ride on a horse , the main thing that you should know is " do n't be afraid of horses ! "
They feel your fear .
Alcoholism is a disease that affects many people in the world today .
I think that is an important illness because it affects the family of alcoholic people .
Moreover , the alcoholics should go to the doctor in order to getting well .
In conclusion , alcoholism is a serious problem for all the society .
I 'm a big fan of science fiction movies , however this kind of movies is actually sometimes a little bad , but in the last weeks a new one has been released , and I was absolutely surprised about this one .
Interstellar is a new Christopher Nolan 's movie which includes the participation of some Hollywood 's stars such as Matthew McConaughey , Anne Hathaway and Matt Damon .
public transport has a big role in transportation specially in large cities like Capital city of countries , using the car some times causes traffic jam if all person uses their own car , to avoid this a good roadways is needed , also the cost of public transportation is lower than private transportation .
on the other hand , public transportation takes more time to get to the required station , because already public transport taking long path to go across more places and as more as peoples take benefits from it , and public transport usually crowed and do not be on time .
for that reason using own car is more comfortable than public transport , you can travel when ever you like and where ever you want .
finally , in the near future most peoples will be using their own car , because it saves much time as comparing with public transport and time factor will be more expensive in the future .
On school days , I get up at 5 a.m. and go jogging in my neighbourhood in 15 minutes .
Then I take a shower , have breakfast with my family members .
Everyone is in a hurry .
I leave home at 7:30 to take a school bus .
After school , I keep running on a track field to be an athlete on a school sports team .
In the rainy season , it is boring to do rehearsals as nobody is on the field .
I come back home on the sunset .
Sometimes , I am exhausted due to a hard workout .
However , I ca n't go to bed early because I have to prepare my homework for tomorrow 's school .
My favourite day it is Saturday because I do not need work or study , so I can go out with my friends and on Sunday I can wake up very late
write soon ,

my favorite sport is basketball .
it is amazing sport .
when i jump to throw the ball in the basket , i feel that i am flying .
when i ran with the ball , i feel that i hold a goal or a valuable something and i should offer my best to put it in his place and make it in right way .
i know that i am not professional player and i am n't belong to any team but i like this game .basketball is so simple play but it is need Speed , concentration and The ability to determine the distances , it contains of two team of five player and each team try to get a high point by throwing the ball through the basket .
What I like most in this game is that The fewest number of player can play it even two player , i recommend everyone to exert it especially with their friends or families ,
In this episode of my life I will to talk you about my daily routine .
I wake up early like 7 am , at this moment go out to the backyard to turn on the boiler , then go to kitchen
Nowadays , people live in very modern and fast society and try to have as convenient life as it is possible .
One of the many possibilities , how do our lives more convenient is to use cars rather than public transport .
Firstly , I like to mentioned public transport 's types .
The most common are bus and train , but in the cities people can use tram , subway or boat and for the long distance they can take a flight .
From my point of view , the main transport disadvantages , which caused our lives discomfort are time and place limitation , sharing the space with others , lack of free seat .
On the other hand , people should think of the environment , pollution , global warming , which all are currently warning .
We should think of our better future and try to behave environmentally friendly - try to avoid the huge pollution , which is by cars caused and do n't think only to our comfort .
In my birthday 's day , I directed go to school this morning . I wonder whether my birthday passed it at lunch time .

Suddenly , I thought of my gift was gone in the class , the students said he / she did n't take , but I doubt them , so we quarrel .
I came home from school , only to found a gift on the sofa .
Ioffer an apology out of harm students , but fortunately he did n't got angry for me .

Hi Peter !
Personally , I agree with your parents .
I think you should save money for the future , because you may have to buy something importantwith your own money .
In my opinion , there are more important things than computer games , so spending money for them it 's like wasting money .
In the future you 'll have to spend a lot of money for the university , the new home and so on , and I think you should start saving money . I should do it too but it 's not simple , actually .
Everything seems so beautiful in the shops !
Silvia .
Actually , where I live the public transport is highly used , It seems that in the near future they wo n't disappear .
In fact in some countries overdeveloped may will extinguish because I suppose travelling by car is much cheaper and faster .
But , that future is very far for our actual situation .
Collecting book is my favourite pastime .
I started my hobby when I was a chid .
The first item in my collection is ABC book .
And now , I have a lot of books of all kinds : biology , chemistry , novel , dictionary , etc .
Now I have about 100 and more in future , I hope that .
Whenever I find an interesting book I buy it immediately .
Sometimes , my family and my friends gives me book such gifts .
I classify them into different categories : manual , cookbook , biography , etc .
It takes all my spare time to clean and dust .
It keeps me amused for hours , too .
This is the first text I would like to write on this website . I think this is a good idea to contribute to English language research and improve my skill at the same time .
As this is my first time , I would like to find out how exactly does the system work , so I chose to write this random text rather than those serious topics available .
Public transport is more convenient than cars , many ways.when we use public transport that benefits many ways .
Maintaing cars are expensive .
Public transport you do not need to worry about any petrol filling , checking tyre pressures , getting tired after driving long journey .
In future cutting down public transport affects many of the people .
Elderly people wo nt able to drive always depends on public transport .
If public transport stop services people who are not able to drive will affect a lot .
Travelling by car is convenient but there are dis advantage as well .
As our population growing fast in a family both husband and wife working and children at university able to drive , so you are looking per house least 3 cars , so imagine how busy our roads will be .
As now fuel price coming down that does not mean that it will stay like that for ever , price go up and down .
In summary public transport is important for our community and people has to raise their concerns regarding this .
Stopping public transport not going to gain anything rather than impact will be unpredictable .
Due to increased traffic may cause delays in arranged journeys , increase the number of accidents ... etc .
I think sport is a good exercise for need to exercise people , I have a suggestion that want to have good health , choose a interest sport and try to play it , let it be a regular thing , it 's will be fun and health your physical constitution .

In spit of that he was dessed up on time .
-Everything is in order , it seems that finally I 'll arrive on time .
Although it was n't , he had forgotten to unplug the iron .
Michael closed the door and he knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Does basketball have the fame that is deserves ?
Nowadays basketball is the sport which rules in the USA .
90% of the Americans wants to be a basketball star , with the dream of playing with Lebron James , Pau Gasol , Marc Gasol ...
According to the results of a questionnarie ( Houston habitants)and most of them , play basketball to forget the homework , problems and to relax in their free time .

public transport has advantages and disadvantages.i will start with disadvantages .
first public transport is neither comfort nor safe .
public transport is very crowded so you may not have a seat .I hate public transport as I was attacked by mad man once .also taxi is not a good transport .I wish I have my own car soon to get rid of public transport . travelling with your car make it easier and better .
The advantages may include that it has a low price and may rescue you if your car is not work .
I am writing regard that your service of outsourcing because I am currently having a problem with my accounted for this reason I am looking for a new service that can help me .
Can you say now , if you have this service ?
If you can have this service may you are the people that I am looking .
I appreciate it could arrange an appointment with you to meet your service .
Please , feel free to contact me if you have any questions .

I 'm a really sportive person I love to different sports I think that it 's something that is great for your body and your metabolism , Did you know that do exercise can reduce depression and increase the quality of your life ?
I think one of my favorites sports of all is the atletism I love it because it is a sport where you prove yourself , you have to be every day better than you where yesterday , it force you to improve every time , also is an exercise that help all your body , especially the legs because it gives them great strength , but also your hands because they have to be in a constant movement , and all the body in general because you run and your metabolism is accommodated and help you to have coordination .
I enjoy running a lot because it relax me , I let out all my worries and frustrations , so it makes me happy .
I recommended all the people who wants to run that if you do n't feel like you 're improving anyway keep going and whit the time you will see results .
I am not sure that mines is the best family in the world but I am pretty sure that I have the best parents I could never wished for .
There is my mother , my father , my two brothers and me .
I am the biggest of the children , than after me is my brother Sidi .
Sidi has 24 years old and at least is Joni , who has only 15 years old .
Generally I miss them all because I live in a distant city away from where my family lives now .
I used to live with them for 25 years a Genoa but last year I left home because I found a job in Milan , which is the city where I actually live now .
Thank you for your attention .
This is an introduction for how to make bank notes .
The first two step is to design with background color artwork and security issues and prepare metal plates with skilled machinists .
Then there are some requirments for printing sheets : color on both sides , special ink and images slightly raised .
The most essential and key process is manual inspections for printed sheets with three categories : good quality sheets , patially damaged sheets and bad sheets .
The qualified and nit damaged severely sheetes are supposed to be packagd and distribued , which will be cut into separate bank notes , packed and then dispatched .
On contrary , other failed sheetes will be disposal and destroyed with band notes in a secure way .

His name was Michael .
Michael lived in a big house in Denton , Texas .
He had a lot of animals : Two dogs and three puppies , four horses , eigth ducks and one cat , Lionel .
Lionel was a black and white cat , and it was a very funny , fast and sweet aminal .
It was the prefer of Michael .
Lionel was the best friend of Michael .
When Lionel was around Michael , the boy was happy .
One day , Michael got up late , and he had going to school at seven o'clock .
It was Six o'clock and he had hurry if he would not want to get to school late .
Michael had breakfast and he forgot to prepare milk for Lionel .
Michael was out all day , and Lionel has not anything for eating ....
Michel closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
When I was a little girl I used to play volleyboll and I really liked that .
One day I had a surprise , I have met a teacher and he invited me to tranee in a huge gym in a team .
I started to think that was born for that sport .
I worked too hard , but enjoe playing really .
Sundully happanned sonething , I need to work to play my studuies in the High school , so the life changes anyway , I needed to stop my favourite sport , because I should need to study in that moment it was more important for me .
Today I do not play volleyboll anymore , but I really enjoy dancing , now I can say that it is my favourite , it is all of .
The line graph shows the U.S. cigarette price in dollar related to cigarette consumption in billions of packs from 1970 to 2006 .
The hugest gab is in 1981 where is the cheapest price combined to the highest expanditure of cigarette packs in the whole interval .
Roughly in 1998 we can notice an equibrium price at 2,75 $ and an equibrium quantity at 23 billions of packs .
Later both lines changed their regular trends so there are an huge imbalance again .
My English is great level and speaking is my favourite part of learning English .

World is progressing rapidly , day by day there is a new ways of transportation , there is a new technology .
From the beginning of the world till now , human wants the fast income and the easy ways of live , so he tries more and more to find a solution for his problems by creating a new ways of liveing more easy and more convenient for him .
So that , transportation was one of the most important issues faced human , because it is related to the interaction between people like trading and many other purposes .
From this point every human have the ability to buy a car and also buy his rest he will not hesitate to do it .
It is claimed thatour lives will improve in the next fifty years .
But we do n't if this change would be good or bad , I hope that will be good but let 's talk about it .
Fistly , i 'd like to talk about employments , i think that these are the most important thing to worry about , if our studies get better , we will create more employments and as a result the economical situation of the country will be better .
Moreover , our capacity fosr learning more lenguages seems to be really adequate unfourtunatelly while there are a lot of teenagers that are getting prepared really hard , there are others that are all the opposite .
I think it is probable that in some years the tecnology could have improve quite a lote , and this is a very powerful advantage for us , the young people .
Beacuse we were borned in ' the internet generation ' as everyone says , so this aspect might be helpful for us .
In conclution , i 've got to said that now we do n't have to worry about the future we just have to carry on in present and do it the better we can .
Hi Alex!h How are you ? I heard that you went out with Mike !

My favourite kind of movie is horror , actually my favourite movie is " The orphan " .
It talks about a little girl who went adopted but she is 35 years old in reality .
It is very creepy !
Anyway , I hope that you come with me to the cinema .
See you soon .

Nowadays the public transport system are running out of passengers due to heavy use of personal transport such as cars and bikes.in early 1990 the public transport systems were most popular trans port system across the world because , most of the peoples had not their own vehicle . but in late 1990 most of the people were able to buy their own vehicle due to many financial institute which has various loan facilities .
today many people use their own vehicle for instead of public transport , the other thing is , it is easy and convenient way to travel to the job and any other personal work . therefore , it can be seen the demand for public transport getting low and lover .
In conclusion , it is true that the demand for the public going down rapidly as thy have their own vehicles .
however , even though everybody has their own vehicles they will have to use public transport once the roads are full of vehicles .
I have seen the following announcement in International Sport Monthly magazine .
My favourite sport is football , and I enjoy because I love football players .
I had the opportunity to meet more about this sport .
I would advise you to the person starting the sport endeavor and can fulfill their dream , many ca n't get what they accomplished those players today are very famous
You can learn with your referee and with coach .
Some people prefer play together but also there competition between players .
People 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
I think that this class discussion could n't true .
In the future people 's live had better .
Providing that we care the environment .
It 's really important .
If we live well , we will be more carefully with world .
Otherwise everybody wanted a future better .
Nowadays there are a lot of things that we doing the live easier .
In order that if I were you , I would live well in the next 50 years .
I 'm looking forward so people will have more interesting by this case .
For instance , my family do n't think that will happened in the next 10 years .
They live at the moment .
Besides they said that in all the moment : ' Carpe diem ' .
This is other opinion .
I 'm Emad from Egypt .
my family consists of 5 members - my father , my mother and tow brothers .
my father is a business man .
he is 65 years old .
he works in real state investment .
my mother is a teacher .
she is 50 years old .
she is working in primary school .
my older brother is 30 years old and he is working as accountant for radio and television union in Cairo .
the younger brother is 25 years old .
he is a dentist .
he is doing master in turkey these days .
the last member is me , I 'm Aeronautical engineer in Qatar .
I love my family but everybody staying and living in different place or country .
the best brother for me is the second one who is a dentist .
he is my best friend and brother .
I hope if I can living with him in the same place .
he is very helpful and collaborator .
we spent a fun time in the beginning of our life when we were kids .
I really love my mother and father .
they spent their life helping us to be good men .
my older brother helped us in studying , but he is older than me by 10 years , so the relation between us is n't strong .
Anyway i 'm very happy to write for you .
This assertive is totally false .
The expansion of public transport is one of the keys saving the planet , especially if the energy source used come from clean sources .
Nowadays , the use of vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel is the main cause of air pollution in big cities around the world . Researches show that the private cars are used most often carrying few person at a time , what makes it very inefficient considering the quantity of carbon dioxide and other toxic substances expelled to the environment each time that the engine is started .
Lady decided to visit her boyfriend .
But she is boyfriend live upstate and hasn't got a airport he 's of city because of that she was need choose by train .
She was just prepared a suitcase after that went to train station .
In my opinion I think that the increase of teenage crime is because their parents do not put limits to them , and how not pay attention , they make all kinds of serious mistakes .
From my point of view , the best thing the police can do with these people is send them to a reformatory until they can leave disciplined .
Another good option is give them a difficult work for every day keep them busy , but I do n't know what kind of job can be , because a person who commit a crime is n't going to do something to help society like communitarian service .
I felt nervous when the phone rang .
I was sitting calmly ina cafe , when I heard it ringing .
Firstly I thought
it could be one of my best friends as we really liked to have lunch together .
But I saw unknown phone number on a display and felt a little bit nervous .
What if it were my boss or clients and possibly something dreadful had happened to my job .
It went on ringing and with great fear I clicked on the green button .
Luckily it was my colleague Jane who wanted to drink a cp of fresh coffee with me .
The flowchat provides an overview of the steps of making bank notes , it shows that how bank notes are manufacted from designing to thing we can used .
This process involves five main stages .
First , it should take some considerations in design , including background colour , artwork , security issues .
Next , skilled machinists is prepared , in which there are metal plates .
Then the printer will print some sheets into bank notes(50 bank notes per sheet).Subsequently , the technical must be used specially for distinction , for example the colour printed on both sides , Special ink is used and imges slightly raised .
After this , printed sheets will be inspected carefully .
According to the quality of sheets , it will be two results.if the quality is good or the bank notes is partially damaged which can be used , it would cut into separate bank notes , then it is packed and disoatched.while those bad sheets will be securely destroyed .

Describe a supermarket near your home
There are not very big Supermarket near my home but there is a nice one .
It is situated in main bolivar cross my home .
The space is about 100 m^2 and it has different automatic doors for inter and exit .
Near to the entry gate person say welcome to customers and answer their questions .
There are some big shelves in center of market are divided to some different parts for kinds of goods like Dried fruit , nuts , flour , condiment , beans , grains , rice , etc .

when you talk with someone have you ever thought in your words before you say it ?
a lot of us never think before they speak and that is not good thing to do .
you must think a little bit before you talk as one word causes a lot of pain for others for the rest they lives .you may not actually notice that but you will feel what am really mean if someone tells you a painful words .
it is clear that everyone is ought to make a mistake without even noticing .
for example a kid named Michael .
Michael is a good boy and he always listen to his mother .on time Michael was very angry as he got a bad score in his test .when he was home his mother was cooking she asked him what is the wrong ?
he said bad words that he will regret saying these words .he went to his room .Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Dear friend ,
It was great to hear from you again .
In your last email you told me about your lack of time of enjoying your hobbies .
I can understand how difficult this decision must be .
However , if I were you , I would do what I have always want .
And I know which matter you 've always been interested : music .
I remember when you told me once you was playing a violin for four hours .
So , a good idea would be to keep yourself doing creative things .
Anyway , you could always do any sport in your extra - free time .
As it 's often said : a good body makes a good mind .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you again .
Tell me what you decide .
Love ,
Anabel
I do n't like the public transport of school .
It is slow , inefficient and dangerous .
I prefer travel in the car or motorbike , i am feeling security .
In my family travel in the taxi , because the taxi is fast and secure .
Today I felt bad in the public transport .
It was solwly .
Also i can see the air pollution is tallest .
Compared car or bus , the car is the most expensive than bus , because the car is comfortable and faster .
The taxi so it is .
In the morning , I go to the school in bus with my brothers but they get out earliest .
I prefer travel in the car .
once upon the time there was a little man called Michael , that man has a heart of a little child and the brave of big man .
he had a girlfriend called sinha who was a girl with a big heart but unfortunately broken one .
one day Michael decided to make a surprise party to sinha to make her happy and feel his love more so he arranged everything and to keep it surprise to her he was busy all the time and did not show off all the week as usual .that make sinha worried and suspect that Michael do not love her any more and know another girl and she become extremely sad and even it become worse when Michael asked her to go to his apartment to make the surprise to her but he did not answer his phone after that .

There 's no discussion which is my favourite restaurant in town , The Seaside . I will tell you why and also why it 's so appropriate for us , as a class to take our last farewell there .
Our class has reformed over the years , with great classmates leaving and coming we have always been welcoming about it , and not at least towards the new ones .
It 's not necessarily to be nice and keen to everyone but our class actually is , in the weekends the whole class gather in different events together .
I think the welcoming process in the beginning is crucial for this fellowship we have today and probably in 10 years too .
What I just told is what the restaurant Seaside means to me . Welcoming .
Fellowship .
At the Seaside 's you are genuinely welcomed at the first doorstep , they accept you whoever you are .
This makes th
It all started in the Parson Institute in the class of art history students of the race of Fine Arts in the class the teacher in charge , Jimena , commissioned a task to his students , saying :
-To Begin with this course , I want to be sure they know the meaning of art , pro I want it translated into a sculpture or painting made by yourselves , without any specific technique , only your imagination , with it you explain to me what it is art .
His excited students began coming to their homes with such work , since they had only 4 days to perform their duties .
After 4 days all came with spectacular pictures , portraits of people , large sculptures , to a student , her name was Sandra , she arrived with a piece of crumpled paper , old in which only had a name written in a style different letter , only there reflected , exposing the moment everyone laughed at her for her work , but the teacher said :
Art is complex , and seeing that everyone laughed with the work of his partner , can see that nobody understood the real meaning , since art is different for each person , each creates a different definition , so we must respect each of them understand that each person is a different world and everyone is art .
A student that really moved him , and reflect so apologetic , and out of the room , closed the door and Michael knew then that he had made a mistake .
In fact , this topic is very important in our modern times .
my favorite sport it affects me greatly.i'm a kung - fu player .
this sport is my favorite , but sometimes I think about to leave this sport . because in later time I hate a blood , so I think a lot of time to leave this sport . but it is dominated to me .
it 's makes me likes an animal when i 'm standing and get ready to fight i 'm convert into enemy.i'm a fucking ghost and I can kill anyone who tried to stop me .
so , i 'm rely thinking left this sport .
Everyday i get up early and exercise in the garden with my friends.i'm exercising more and more again to improve myself and become the best fighter in the world.i'm champion in my sport so , i 'm seek to do all my effort to be the first one in the world.finally I did not find encourage of my family or my teachers .
Hello to every body ! !
Now I 'm going to talk about the benefits o learning another language .
I am from spain so my foreign language is Spanish
I start to study another language when I was a child , I started learning English because every one said that English is the future language , when I finished my school time I tried to study French but it was so difficult for me .
I have to say that study another language give you more opportunities because on these days you need to now other language to look for a work and be more inteligent than your college to take the work and that 's great .
And to day is necessary because if you want to travel around the world and meet people and have conversation with their you need to now more than your foreign language , because in the rest of the world and particularly in Europe people now more than two language and that great .
I think learning other language never have drawbacks because all you learn is good for you and your main , you never stop to now new things .
These days , most of the people feel comfortable to travel through car and then they believe that public transport is not going to be sustain for longer time .
However I do not agree with them because in most part of the world mass transport system is still popular and they are environment friendly and cost efficient .
Firstly , Public bus service is very popular in most part of the world .
In most part of the Europe , people still prefer public bus instead of car to travel .
Secondly , public transport are environmentally sound in comparison to private vehicle .
It carries more people while private vehicle carries fewer people .
Public bus do not let more cars to contaminate environment .
Finally , Public transport 's cost efficient .
People need to spend more money on fuel if they want to travel same destination by private vehicle .
In conclusion , although car is convenient to travel , it is not enough to finish the future of public transportation .
In the towns of the future , the care of the environment is one of the most important thing .
People have conciencied themselves that we need to respect the nature and the human places where we live .
Human beings have destroyed our environment along the time and now , the earth is in danger .
First place we need to care about is our near place , the town .
I like to take out the trash every night and I try to recycle my trash throwing it in different bags .
I have recently bought an electric car in sustitution of my traditional car .
An electric car is less harmful for the environment .
When I go out to the camp , if I lunch there , I take care of cleaning the ground .
I like nor the dirty people neither the dirty places .
I hope to live in the future in a clean town and I 'm sure that the most of the people are now thinking in this way . We need to care of our town because nobody like to place into a dump .
Military service is the military training which needs people have to join army or voluntary for a period of time .
In Korean , people should completed military service at least 2 years .
Similarly , people have to join it 1 year in Taiwan .
It is a debate that should everyone have to complete military service when they reach 18 years old .
With supporters maintaining that it is important for national security and make people maturity , whilst opponents claim that the military service have effects on study and should have freedom of choice .
Firstly , every countries acquire stabilization must be protected by a stronger armed forces for national security .
If the war or other dangerous threat the safety of country , they can not get help from other countries immediately .
Therefore , people accept military service could be easier to protect their country .
Especially some small population of country have policy that is people need join military service due to develop into a powerful country .
Secondly , the important for people become maturity when they completed military service , which probably is a particular experience for 18 years old .
In addition to have hard physical training and get different special skills , people also can improve personal quality in military service .
Consequently , people could be more independent and strong , they seems to earlier become mature than other people who do not completed military service .
In contrast , opponents of military service point out that study is the first vital thing for people who reach 18 years old .
Military service mainly to improve physical , however study might be completed better in school at the age because it has professional teacher team and a good study atmosphere , people usually easier to concentrate on learning knowledge .
For instance , some countries allowed people join military service after their all courses was finished .
Additionally , critics argue that countries are able to allow people have freedom of choice for military service .
Relatively some people unwilling join military service , people volunteered in a military service possibly enjoy it .
Furthermore , it also can respect for right s of people , especially for women who do not can adapt the hard training .
In conclusion , it can be concluded that military service is necessary for national security and good for people improve themselves .
The best course of action would be government attempt to allow people volunteered in conscription when they completed their studies .

This city do n't have a lot of citizen but It 's a travel city .
So in the street always have a lot of trash cans .
It will help people not throw the garbage in the street .
In our city have a billboard to urge people to have attention to environment .
In the school set up a workshop to tell with students important environment to our live .
The citizen of the city want to build the city with the slogan " The city green - clean - beautiful " .
So they have aware to keep the city reach that .
So everyone bring the trash to the place permission .
Every year have " earth hour " .
In this hour , many people turn off the light in their house to save energy and protect environment .
I am very proud about the awareness from my city people .

And they have act to protect it .
I was in a museum of New York looking at all the beautiful paintings and sculptures , when I hear the alarm of the museum everyone was afraid including me .
The police was chasing the bandit that stole a painting , but he escaped instantly .
The police let all the people go .
I went to my apartment and turn on my TV and I watch in the news that the bandit escaped with 3 paintings .
I decided to solve the case .
I went to the museum and follow all the tracks that I found were a broken sculpture .
I search for any clue and I found something , it was a piece of paper with an address on it .
I follow the address and when I get there it appears to be an abandon house .
I decided to wait , and hide on the bushes if I see someone entering .
In the night I see a shadow entering the house .
I carefully approached the window of the house and I see two men with the paintings .
They left the house on a truck .
I follow them in a taxi .
We were on the terminal of New York it was a very famous landmark .
There were a lot of commuters on the terminal so I lost the two men .
I located the instantly because I recognize their hats .
I was focal to them .
They threaten all the people cruelly so all the sightseers were angry with them .
However the modernization of the terminal was unknown to me so I was completely lost .
We entered on a train , the ceiling was comfortable but everyone was objecting of the two men .
When we arrived we were on the other side of the city of New York the features were so common because it was a good economic and conveniently because would attract more tourists .
I finally trap them their names were Lucius Fowley and Bob Parker I tell the police and the police put them on jail .
And the paintings were on the museum again .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do somethig immediately .
Today is a very important day for the sake of his future .
The watch shown the time is 9.30am and 2 hours left before he go to the place that made his heartbeat so fast .
He have an interview for getting the scholarship so that he can pursue his dream to study medical in Ireland .
He went to the station bus to ride on bus .
He took a few minutes for walking to the station bus from his house .
After the bus arrived he ride on and half an hour he arrived to the destination .
When he took a few steps from the bus he saw a very tall building that the interview places located .
After waiting an hour the time comes and bravely with high confident level he walke to the office .
Suddenly his water floaded and tears drop from his eyes .
The interviewer who is sitting infront of him was a person with blue eyes that he really loves .
The situation suddenly changed .
Peter without doubt hugged the intertiewer who is a man about 4o years old .
The man who is crying together with him was his father that have leave peter and his mom because they had divorce 6 years ago .
Then the interview became a meeting between father and a son that really touched .
Killed two birds with a stone is a perfect idiom to describe Peter 's situation because he got his beloved father back and still can pursue his dream to studies in ireland.q

And I need your help with this .
Would you like to improve this course with me ?
Please , writes me a list with the words when I need for technical konversation .
Thank you very much .
Dear Teacher Mary
I am writing to give my opinion of the restaurant " The Crazy Cat " this is a very good restaurant .
first the restaurant have wide variety in his food .
The chef can make the menu of the day to the dinner or you can choose a special menu .
The purpose of the chef is soup and creamed corn to start , beef medallion covered bittersweet of carrot sauce with nuts and the dessert chocolate cake with cheese .
the atmosphere is also very good has music in live with different bands .
you can choose two bands of rock or pop and one dj .
the cost is accessible .
The pack have a cost of $ 350 a person .
Can a TV programme get to entertain and educate at the same time ?
Nowadays , it is the most important challenge for television .
People complaint about how the information about different TV shows do n't contribute in the process of learning , that 's why many of This programmes are considered trash , because of the multiples shows such as realities , talk shows , or showbiz that hardly ever have a good message or something interesting for people .
A good example of this shows are how people are paid to act in realities or talk show where they show exaggerated or hilarious familiar problems , where the only aim is to get more audience .
Another good example are the endless showbiz that are appeared recently , this type of programs where the information is often gossip about personal life of famous singers and actors without taking into count if they are true or not .
It 's a pity to know that exist just a few programs that try to educate people with the most update information through documentaries , investigations , cultural or opinion programs , which in my opinion help to acquire more knowledge .
Knowledge that sometimes are unknown even though it is part of the general culture or proper of the history of our country .
I think in the future do n't exist public transport because we will drive their car .
When you drive your own transport , a car for example , you going to from a specificlly place but in a bus you go to the bus stop and no to your house or school , work ...
It is better from the people be more comfortable because you drive and not the other person . I know some people , the drivers , began haven't got work , but the public transport is free and is free because it is the government pay , this money bacame do to make more work for others .
No all is good some people haven't got money ca n't go to another place to another place and the pollution became more and more , it is a serious problem and the solution is only for the rich people , the solution is buy an electric car , the other solution , more economic , is the government give the money to the population to buy an electric car .
I do n't know what is better no public transport or public transport .
There is no future for public transport since everybody prefer to use their own car .
now time is valuable for every body nobody bothered about money .
traffic is very high in now days so it will be difficult to reach office on time .
public transport is always crowded so it is not comfort to travel
Find your joy in scary movie
I would ignore thriller films due to my fragile heart , but my mind is changed now after watching this film .
The film is entitled " Scary Movie " which is directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans .
This story was shown a murder who completed the mission : killed everyone that he hated .
At last , only one person could be alive even those sacrificed had tried to escape this horrible result .
This is a combined story of horror and comedy .
I can not find a word to describe this film easily , what can I say is you will be regret if you miss this film .
This first reason is all actors shown their talent in this film directly and audience can follow their steps and the story certainly , this essential element which also makes a big success to the film .
Besides , the attractive story line makes a lot of climax so that everyone can finish this film from the beginning to the end and creates the billion box office to this film .
However , I think the tools should be improved , such as killer 's knife and actors'costumes , the knife looks like as brittle as a handicraft , I believe those are seconded - handed clothing . I think this is a pity to this movie .
At last , your bravery can be improved after watching this film .
What are you waiting for ? Go and check it out !
Hi everyone , my name is Jaime and I have my wife and a little child .
My wife 's name is Maritza , she is 30 years old , she is a beautiful and joyful woman , my son 's name is Rafi , he is 3 years old , he is very handsome and fun child .

I 'm studiying medicine , this major is too challenging although stressful , because the self - study is every day and there are a lot of information .
This major involves all , always we have to consider the all possibilities to resolve homework , you have to know the most possible information for can resolve it .
When you got the answer or solution you can see that all effort worthwhile .
Our teachers are doctors and they are in charge of teach us about work - team , so it 's common that one / two people do all work ... with this I want to say : is rewarding when our teacher ask something and you know the answer because you could study all topic .
I have experience to go to the hospital and was too interesting .
I deal with medicine students who are superior to me , for example , doctors and surgeon .
I only could oversee what they do to obtain visual experience and know how was a surgery .
How learning English
It 's proven that to learn a foreign lengueage you have to go abroad .
You can study hard for years , but if you arent't obligated to use English for things of everyday , you wo n't became good at it .
There are n't other options .
Of course , also studyng in a foreign country has disadvantages .
First , it costs a lot .
Even there are lots of different possibilities and scholarship , not everydoby can allows they .
Living abroad , even though for a short time , it could be very stressful and people can feel homesick .
Despite that , there are more reasons to go studyng away .
It is a very useful experience in many ways .
You will learn better and faster than studying at home .
In addition , visit new countries and meet new cultures , helps to open your mind and to foster a lot .
I did several school trips in the past years and I 'm going to do it again sure .

carbohydrates are essential for a healthy diet .
It provides energy for our bodies .
Nutritionists recommend the quarter of a person 's diet should contain carbohydrates .
When your body takes an insufficient amount of carbohydrates , the protein replaces the lack of carbohydrates to supply the body with energy .
And this will cause diseases on the long run .
Dear reader ,
My name is Andreas Miret and I am 18 years .
I am from Sweden but I have been living in Barcelona since I was young .
Nowadays , I am studying a degree in economics at the University of Barcelona .
I am applaying for the job vacant in the summer camp .
I have some experience working with children aged between 5 and 17 years .
Last year I was working every friday and sunday at a ski camp in la masella .
Also this summer i went to the United States and I was working in a summer camp .
Now our company is going to do multidimensional operation , not just focus on furniture but also for home appliance .
In addition , we will adjust company 's management direction in each department depend on market 's reaction and environment
Like retailer ,
We have sold our products to KA system for few years , however , the products that we sold were usually popular consumer goods , it means cheat and have no enter obstacles for other supplier .
In addition , it is hard to collect money from KA system .
And because we have our own factories and professional machines , we can easily to avoid the price competition .
To make high obstacle furniture , like R - angle wooden cabinet , high gloss cube .
We will search the market demand based on our core products , also produce high quality products .
For the factories , because Chinese demographic dividend are not like before anymore , the low price and undiversified products should become verity and premium goods .
Focus on user experience , inventive , unique and our core products
Therefore , we are reforming and doing high - tech items , likes LED , photoelectric , vacuum , steam mop , etc .
Use this core technology to develop blow machine , air cleaner , iron , etc .
Besides , factories are keeping going on our professional items and service like , high glossy , auto painting and 4-side edge sealing , honeycomb board , etc .
Also for our wire rack , plastic
products .
And still working hard to build our own brand .
Nowadays , people have a lot of afraid about contaminations of Planet .
All governments increasing their politic laws about this topic and also they promoted new rules in the daily life of the population .
One of the new rules about the reduction of contamination in the cities is the transport public .
According to the general world laws about the global world warm , each country has considered its owns arguments about it .
I can give us an example how big cities around the world can reduce more contamination .
London is a good example and Barcelona too .
These cities do n't allow to drive in the centre city , the industry reduces its taxes if it 's increasing the politic nature .
My city is a good example , too .
The town major has offered to population free bus .
It 's a good idea to remove the traffic jam .
I think , in conclusion , all people should have a good behaviour and an open mind and they and myself also to catch more often the public transport .
My country is the best country in the world .
I love it so much .
We have different cultures here , and two main languages , Arabic and Amazigh .
Morocco is a kingdoom , like Spain and England , We have king and princes .
My day in London !
I went to London in the summer .
I liked London , because there are a lot of great things .
On Monday me and my friend Chrissy went to the Big Ben .
we wnet to the Trocadero .
But the best was the Guarda from Bukingham Palace .
chrissy made a funny face but the Guards did n't say anything .
We had very , very good weather .
It was fantastic .
The temperatures was over 20 degrees .
We travelled to London by plane , but to come back we travelled by car abd boat .
After we came back I told my family everything .
Environmental changes really need in the current situation .
People contribuation is very important in this matter .
The report explains how my town people taking care of my surroundings and to preserve this planet in a betterway .
Firstly , hyrid cars only allowed to use during weekends as result of this most people not using there cars all the week .
This attitude reduced enromous amount of smoke pollution from the pipes .
Government policy changes help a lot for water preservation .
Many factories follwing the regulations and not draining the harmful wastage in the water .
Secondly , Closed trash bins provided to the people in order to collect the waste and recycling .
People come forward and utilising this bin effectively instead of throwing away .
As a result of this town looks clean compare to previous decades .
In addtion to that recyclable waste , sell and the money will be given to respective person .
This gives motivation to the public and they can earn by using right way to dispose their waste .
Thirdly , Public toilets has been opened for the public to elminate attitude of urinating in the public places .
Town council not only encourage people to planting or garndening , it subsidise money for their green improvements .
Example , free fertilizers , water pump failitiesand pesticides .
Is summary , people taken many intiative steps and moving forward to have safe and attracticve eniroment surrondings .
My favorite sport is football .
This is a internacional sport because in all parts of world there are persons that they play .
football is a fameous sport you can whatch it on tv or yo can see it on direct.there ara a lot of level categories , the most fameous categorie is the first .
people that they play in this categorie are fameous althoug you can see them on tv.if you want to be a big football player you must to practise more time and yoor life should to be healthy .
you must to care your food and yours habits for you have a healthy body .
this sport is the best of the world and the most fameous annd i think that this is the most enjoyed .
Soccer is the best sport for me because you can get fit , meet other people and participate on competitions .
If you want to start practicing this sport , you should be prepared to work hard .

The graph given shows the seasonal sales of ice - cream from two places at an Englishl seaside resort from 2012 to 2014 , they are separately an ice - cream van and an indoor public swinmming pool .
As the graph indicates , the sales at ice - cream van was generally larger than that at indoor swimming poor .
For the ice - cream van , it saled most in Jul - Sep each year , nearly reached 5000 dollars and it was still slightly increasing year by year .
In every year , from January to July , the sales slightly increased and reached the peak at the third season , then it gradually slide back to the year 's bottom .
Each year was nearly the same .
For indoor swimming poor , its sales did n't have large changes , usually saled about 2000 - 3000 dollars for each season .
It usually saled most in Apr - Jun and Oct - Dec and slided to the bottom in Jul - Sep .
In general , its sales were falling with the time went by .
There was a nice spring morning .
Both of them were young , beautiful and naive .
She put her cup of coffee on the windowsill , hooked up the brist on her beautiful little breast , put right her colourful light - minded skirt , took her orange scarf and red little handbag and went to the door .
He stood up near the open window , smoked and looked at her without any words .
When she said good - bye , he just nodded .
When she looked at him from under her long eyelashes he turned away and stared at the landscape outside .
When she made step out , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Nowadays we constantly use means of transport to go everywhere so that our lifestyle .
Society depends on them .
We are used to travel by car , in fact each family has one .
Despite , travelling by public transport can be a better option in so many cases .
Certainly cities will be crowded in the future because population is always increasing .
Using your own car to go to the citycentre could be a nightmare , it would be a stressful waste of time .
Ubearable traffic jams and no parking areas would be the main problems .
Besides , the price of petrol is increasing too , and it likely will be as expensive that most people not be able to afford a car .
In contrast , there will be cheaper alternatives as bus , train or even plane for long distances .
In other hand , many drivers enjoy travelling by his vehicle because they like to drive and they feel free .
Finally goberments and society are concerned about the environment and I consider that they will decrease levels of pollution and co2 emitions .
From my point of view public transport will not disappear even if cars are much more comfortable , faster and more evolved than now .
Time is precious .
Every one ca n't deny that time is a big factor in our life .
The life divided to terms of time , we live through time , we grow with time
till Now , we talk in time and finally , we perish after time .
World change by time .
Time never stops and does n't wait anyone .
We must value time . I hope my country to be as a developed countries in using the best use of time .
once moment lost is lost for ever .
it can never be regained even the strongest monarchs have been helpless to prevent time .
So should be careful about the importance of time .I hope to not waste it and use it as the best use for giving opportunity for rising .Those who waste it , will be behind and they will fail to make a mark in their life .
The great men and successful guys became fame and rose by a suitable use for time .They guide and source of inspiration for a new generation .
So , we can say that time is a double - edged sword , either help you or agonist you and in the popular say is right that say " do n't delay the work of this day to the next day " because our works will accumulate then it become more hard to finish it .To ensure best use of time in our life , we need to be punctual.punctuality avoid tension and trouble things , finally even scientists have another vision about time , they discover that time is the fourst dimension by relative theory which exchange all concepts in science .
I ca n't say expect that time more important in our life and we need to save it .
My town is very small .
His name is Santa Marta and he is near Trujillo .
In my town , we can see a big swimming pool , five parks , four bares and one state school .
in my town there are a lot of old people , and there are nor much children , because they love in other cities .
I love my town , because when I was a small girl , I went there , and I was with my grandparents , my cousins and my friends .
my best friend live in madrid , but We always were together in her house or in my house 's grandparents .
I have been very happy , and today I am happy there .
Dear Amanda :

The diagrams below show how bank notes are made through four steps and how bad shees and notes are disposed .
To begin with , the format of the bank notes needs to be designed , factors of considerations including the background colour , the artwork and the security issues .
Sencondly , equipments like skilled machinists as mental plates should be prepareed for the next steps .
Thirdly , print the sheets of bank notes(50 banks notes per sheet)with special ink , where colour is condidered on both sides and images will slightly raised on the bank notes .
Most importantly , manually inspected on each printed sheet in case that there would exist damaged sheets .
Once damaged sheets are discovered , partically separate them into good and bad ones and them burn the bad notes , making sure that the remaining sheets are of good quality .
Good sheets are cut into separate bank notes , then packed and dispatched to other place , comparing with which , the bad ones have to be destroyed securely .
the movie which I have chosen to write about is microphone .
it is An egyption movie acted by khaled aboelnaga and young actors . the actions of this film took place in Alexandrie city of Egypt and it talks about some young people who need a good chance to deliver their voices to people as they did n't have much money to produce their own albums ,
that sort of bands is famous between the youth and they call it " under ground bands " .their songs give a big concenet to the political and social stituation in Egypt and they become famous after the25 january revoulation , why I choose this movie as it reflects what happens in our society , there is no chance for the youth and if they found it , they face lot of problems to save it and they did n't find time for other activties and in sometimes they worked in thing which they never learn or love
I live in a small city , then there are few things that my town made for the environment : like the recycling , therefore we must know of what is made the material that we throw , and put them in the right dumpster .
This is a little act for us , but if we all contribute will be a big help for the environment .
We also can use appliance that not consume so much , if we can adopt sustainable electric systems or buy organic products .
In the big cities they have began to build green buildings , they use the electricial public transport not to pollute .
In my opinion there may be many rules , but if we do n't respect it , we will not help our habitat .
The most exciting day on my life was May 9th , last year , when I attend the secondary school .
I stayed on France with my friends and my teachers .
I woke up very early .
I catch the bus and I waved my mum .
Then I talked with my friends about our holiday .
After six hours we had lunch on a fast food to France .
Next we visited a famous aquarium where I looked a lot of fish .
It was interesting !
On the evening we had dinner on a particular restaurant and my friends and I did many photo with a famous sight .
I was admiring the sea while my friends looked around the shop .
The days after we were in a parfurms and I bought a present for my mum .
My teacher wanted to our speak to French .
In the end my friends and I jumped into the sea .
It was crazy .
I will never forget this experience !
The cat LOZAH
At a nice day , my old brother surprise me .
He bought a cat .
It is a first time for me to play with a cat .
It is a nice experience .
I called it LOZAH because its color like an almond .
The almond is called in Arabic LOZ .
LOZAH is four months old .
It is female cat .
LOZAH plays with balls and ropes .
It likes my laptop and it play with the Cursor .
That is funny but makes me nervous .
The LOZA cat is Shirazi type .
It sleeps eighteen hours per a day .
The nice sleeping of it is when it watching anime .
It plays with children very well .
when the children went out it became sad .
I love its soft hair .
It runs behind the ants and flies .
It eats chicken , tuna , milk and cheese .
It hates the water .
When we need to punish it we spreed some drops of water at its face .
I hope it to be a good cat and a good experience for me .
Dear Bob ,
my firs job was baby sitter .
I have to look forward at two little boys : seven and nine years old .
I was seventeen years old , when I decided to accept this work .
The parents of these boys were friends of my parents .
I have been the baby sitter of these children for all that summer and I enjoyed so much with them .
They lived in a big house with a lovely swimming pool where we can swim and play .
At the end of the summer , I have kept on seeing these boys to help them during the school year .
This experience helped me a lot because I become much more responsible not only with these boys but also with my brothers and sister ( I had two brothers and one sister)and I have learned the meaning to work and receive money .
I did n't have problems because the children were quiet and respectful , and also because I known them since they were newborn .
I hope to have satisfied to all your questions .
Have a good work

I grew up in a parent family .
Sometimes I felt that I was alone and not loved .
However , we were lucky enough to have a great mother who tried all her best to keep my older brother , my older sister and I for completing our college studies .Of course my uncle , young brother of my mother gave a big hand to go through the hard , so that made us often help each other in my family when the member who was in hard .
Especially I was the youngest member in the family , made much more troubles when I was young .
I had truancy and did not pay attention to studies .
That really the biggest harm to a hard - working woman whom my mother tried all her best to feed me up and help me complete my studies .
All the members of my family never give me up , and I finished my college studies , too .I have a good job now .
I do really thank my mother and all the members for paying the patient and exertion to me .Now we have great relationship with each other and treasure the happiness we get not so easy .
So , are the members of my family my best friends?I'll answer you : there 's not much better answer than Yes !

It creating lot of troubles by standing on the edge of the buses and metros .

Usually , I play football with my friends in stadium .

My favorite sport
There are so many sports in the world , like basketball , baseball , running , yoga , swimming , and so on .
Anyone has their favorite sports .
Someone likes go hiking , others likes dancing , still others like playing
volleyball .
And , either do I. I also like sports .
One of them which I like most is badminton .
Why my favorite sports is badminton ?
There are some reasons .
First of all , exercising can make you
become more healthy .
Second , playing badminton can active all body , like hands , arms , feet .
Third , when I
play it with someone , whatever just for fun or for the game , my body will feel so hot in thirty minutes .
Then , it can play indoor , also , it can play under the sun .
Finally , I am good at playing badminton .
Playing badminton can do lots of great things for you , expect good for health , it also can make a lot
of fun and play with family or friend happily .
If someone answer me what the best sport is , I will say :
Badminton is .
My favourite sport is badminton because I used to practise it when I was a child and I loved it .
It seems to me a complete sport because you can practise it in pairs or in an individual way .
To be good at badminton you need to prepare yourself in a physical way but also the psychological part is very important .
You have to be able to play for a long time , analyze your opponent 's mistakes to win and to have measure about your energy for no to be exhausted before the match is over .
For someone who is starting this sport I would give just one advise : enjoy .
Because if you are trying to win you will lose the most important thing , to discover how wonderful to play a sport could be .
now days young people are influence towards the western culture so , they are getting more fashionable.youngster are interested to wear different stylish and colored clothes.they are happy with wearing different color clothes.they did n't want to wear our cultural dress such as sari , dhoti , choli and many more.they only like to wear shirt , pant skirt , t shirt and many more.youngster are influence by watching different programmes on television .
Sport is important part of my life .
Two years ago when I was still in school .
Many classmates went to different sections of the sport .
But I could n't go with them at the time , I was sick a lot .
One day my friend invited me to karate .
He gave me 3 days to think about it .
I decided and went .
It was strange because I never went to the sports .
From the time I started going to karate .
After one month my instructor told me that I will go to the competition .
I was very worrying and nervous .
The day of the competition and I came with others to show how I 'd practiced .
Then instructor said my name and I went out on the Tatami.when I left I had a special feeling many people look and clapping .
It took 3 minutes I won with three accounts too .
I was very happy because it was my first competition .
After the end of the competition , we were all awarded medals and certificates .
Then as always sounded Kazakhstan hymn .
This time I felt like a Champion it was really especially feeling .
When I went to karate I 'm not even sick .
Sport has given me a boost of vitality , energy , optimism and strengthen the immune system .
My most exciting day was the June 8th 2014 , an international competition in Belgium .
The day before there were the qualifications , that I passed .
The day of the finals I was so nervous , but determined .
There were athletes who are European champions and I picked up all my courage and I did my exercises very well , except for a fall from the beam .
After the competition I was relaxed and happy , because I have done my job .
Eventually I placed 7th both beam and floor , and after we took the photos I go back to the changing room .
When I left , some girls were out of the dressing room with a sheet and a pen in the hands and they asked me an autograph .
I was really surprised and happy , I would never have thought !
The little girls thanked me , then I go to eat with my team and the day after we went back to Italy .
An easy recipe are cookies .
You need butter , flour , sugar , eggs , vanilla and chocolate .
Mix butter , eggs and vanilla .
The mixture must be smooth and compact . Pour the chocolate and cut the cookies with a round shape .
Baker them for 15 minutes

The world is changing around .
Technologies are moving on in high speed .
As the technologies world is moving fast and the auto mobile industry is also coming with new variant of cars & scooters in very economical way .
Buying cars and scooters are more convenient than the last decade .
In few decade people earnings and living style have also changed .
People now buying cars and scooters as per their convenience and pocket .
Earlier people used to buses , taxes , autos for reaching offices , schools , colleges , shopping etc .
Which was time consuming and obliviously cheaper way of commuting from one place to other .
Since today worlds is time saving world hence people do n't care about their pocket .
Using personal veihicles is more convenient to them than using public transport .
So the public transports importance is reducing every day .
If it so their will a time when single people will not interested for public transport .
This has tremendous impact on other aspect .
Fuel consumption has increased in few years .
Net of cars and bikes is reason for heavy traffic jam every side .
Ratio of road accidents has been increased in few decades .
People not even care about safety parameters while driving on road .
I must say that Public transport is life line in today worlds .
PUBLIC TRANSPORT
Public transport is a very useful resource , you can travel without polluting the atmosphere and it is very cheap .
But , why it will disappear ?
Nowadays , we usually travel very often to many different places , so for us is more comfortable our cars , but for the atmosphere and for our wallets , it is n't .
Using public transport we will avoid traffic and so many accidents , so why we do n't use it more ?
It will be a great advance for people and for the atmosphere , and as well for the countries because we will save a lot of money
I recommend you to use public transport .
I think that family 's members could n't be friends because the relation is very different .
There are many good reasons to say that .
Firstly , family is the base of the relationships .
Secondly , although the friendship and love are the most important feelings , the family structures the person and influences their behavior .
I feel my family in a different way from my friends .
Although I have a good relationship with my parents , I could n't think them like friends .
Some people think that this is possible but I disagree because it confuses roles in the family .
The parents have to give education to the children over obviously love
In conclusion I think that two relationship are different .
Perhaps I think that this statement is false because I think that statement should say that the the public transport is going to have in the future because travelling by car is not so much more convenient .
I think that travelling by car is good because you have your own sit and in the winter your car is hot and you also can listen to the radio .
In the public transport you do n't have your own sit so sometimes you travel standing which is not very comfortable and in winter you do n't have air conditioning so if it 's cold in the outside it 's cold inside the transport to , sometimes you have to travel with sick people that can transmit you the illness .
Otherwise the public transport do n't pollute but the car pollute so for us travelling by car is better than travellng by public transport but for the atmosphere is better travelling by public transport than travelling by car

There are two wardrobe , one for me and one for my brother .
There is a stereo system on the bench and scareted around the room there are a lot of puppets
There is a clothes hanger near the window and the curtains are yellow , green , blue , violet and white .

Hello , my name is habiba jahid I am fifteen years old I live in Egypt .
I like English very much I like learning new languages and things .
I am not a native speaker of English but I wish that I will be one day .
what makes me like learning new languages is how it makes me communicate with others easily , I also like traveling so much as it makes me see new places and learn more about other countries around the world and their cultures and traditions however , I do n't travel outside my country because I am a student and I do n't have my own money which I can spend it on what I like .
my dreams when I grow up that I travel alot around the world , marry a romantic funny person , have a good life and be a good mother like my mother .
Years ago I was very worried how will happening in the future .
About the contamination , technology , obesity and other things around the world .
Nobody cared how we lived .
But , in this moment the people think different , is to start to help the world and
Contamination is big problem for us and the planet .
In the past the people bought thing , and they did n't care how is dangerous for the planet .
Now , the people is more conscious and they know how dangerous is for the planet .
Also , TV , radio , internet , big companies has adverisement for helping the planet .
Moreover , schools since kindergarten is educating for clean the planet , simply like separate the garbage .
Obesity and other thins about help , is a topic very important because the people is dying for this problem .
For example , the form to prepare the food , is gon na be dangerous because a lot food have artificial thing that is no good for us .
To turn to , alredy people cook the food in form organic o with products more naturally without chemical .
But this kind of food is expensive and the people can not buy .
Technology has good thing and bad things .
The technology is advancing very fast , in the best way this is good for us because we wiill do a lot of thing .
Maybe , in 2060 we will be able to go to the moon very easy , like go to Europe .
Also , the cars will fly , and maybe is better for the city .
In conclusion I think that we on track for the next years .
Compared with the past the people is more conscious and is worries for the world .
As a result for that we going to have a better life , more healty and clean for the next years .
I hope to continue in this way because is our future , is our life and we have to care it for have good and happy life in the next years .
No one can deny the importance of the public transport , but actually this importance is turn to private sector transport .
And this importance of private transport because private transportation provide a comfortable mean to move from one place to another , also it is help to keep a time and reduce costs which spending in public transportation .
firstly , that private transport provide a comfortable mean to travelling from one place to another without sharing stranger people a way and by using this kind of transport also comfortable in free with choosing time of a trip .
Secondly , it is a good way of travelling or moving from one place to another without wasting a time in waiting a specific time to move or even waste a time in waiting a public transportation to reach all point it should get it , but in the other side when you have your own transport or a private transport is get a right to choose time of trip or when you want to move or stay , and nowadays we can not waste our time in taking public transport .
finally , a public transport need more costs , because public transport ( such a buses , train ) fees every year is increasing , and this problem we do not face it by private transport ,

Now I will talk about the Daruma , a Japanese restaurant that was for me a very good experience .
First of all , the food was very delicious .
The Yakimeshi , the sushi and all the dished was like a taste of the real Japan .
Also you can see how they prepare your food in front of you .
The tables have a grill where the chef makes his magic .
All the place was surrounded by a nice and warm atmosphere .
That makes anybody feels a new level of pleasure , in the same process that everybody repeat everyday , eat .
It was a sunny day , a special day in my life.the day was 29 October in 2009,that day I had a university admission test at shajalaj university .
Before this day I was frustrated so it brings a happiness in my mind .
Very luckily , a beautiful girl sat on my bench .
With talking her for a few minutes , I become too happy .
In fact I fall in love with her at first sight .
So I was just thinking how to convince her .
there was no other option for me i just want her . during the exam time , i was thinking whole time how to communicate with her .
When the examination is over , again I started to talk with her , asking how was your exam .
She told me not good at all , but my was good and she also added that you may got the chance and finally I got it .
After three days later our result has been published and I got the chance but the girl did n't .
Then I become too much unhappy .
I expected if both of us get the chance then it will be very good .
But alas ! my dream did n't come true .
When I was returning from syleth I called the girl and talk to her and assure that I got chance in university but girl says that she knew it .

At present , many people think that English is the world language and it is absolutely an essential skill to communicate with other countries people .
Due to this reason , Taiwanese parents do not want their kids to start behind others , thus , many kindergartens started to teach children English .

Television is one of the most useful inventions of the modern world .
It is one such commodity which serves the dual purpose of both education and entertainment at one and the same time .
The tv shows broadcasted on television play a vital role in shaping the thoughts of the viewers .
I think , I can agree with the opinion , that shopping is not always enjoyable .
In my opinion it is dependent on that , what we buy and with who we go to the shopping .
To tell the true , shopping is so bored to men , particularly when they go to the store with women .
Shopping with women is nightmarish .
They always run in the shops and ca n't choose anything .
Then they are always crying and yelling like wild goats .
When I 'm listening this , I want to commit hara - kiri .
No future for public transport ?
why do use public transport some of us use it to save money for not buying gas or they ca n't buy a car or if they had problems in their cars or they do n't have the mood to drive .
Now a days with technology we have different ways to transport like hoverboards , skateboards and maybe it makes No future for public transport
Another point is we have our own cars and it 's more comfortable , I do n't have to wait in line to buy tickets .
I do n't have to be late for the delays , I can do anything in my own car I can put music I can drink , eat , speak or wherever .
I do n't have really an opinion I just do n't know.we will wait and find out .
Tell me your opinions about this subject in comments .
My Favourite Sport .
We are living in rush world .

In my opinion it 's have to be like brushing teeth .
We do it for hygiene !
My hygiene is running or more familiar word is Jogging .
Run Forest Run !
It is the most simple form of activity .
Jogging has existed since the beginning of the earth .
I can say that is the most natural move for human .
All that you need for become Runner its motivation and plan .
That what was happened with me personally .
Motivation for my been 15k run competition .
But I never before have work our Jogging .
So for finish competition with pleasure I needed work out plan witch is diary day by day about our jogging distance , time , mood during work out .
First of all it is absolutely minimum , you just need boots for run !
It is one main condition , rest of your dress are not important .
Shoes are for protect and prevent your health , you have got only one body look after them .
I enjoyed my favourite sport because I feel better after Jogging I think better and I meet lovely great people because of running .
My advice is : eat a lot of vegetables and fruit , drink plenty of water and run at least 3 times per week .
I will tell you a review of a thriller , the thriller is Hunger games it is about some capitals and people are choised and play on a game , you have to kill persons for they do n't kill you , is a movie that have suspense because you want to know ho survey , in the movie someone love someone and protect each others , is very cute but on the 3 movies they are bad moments with the family , capitals , Friends , etc .

My bedroom
My bedroom is n't very big and is untidy .
There are two desks with two computers , two chairs and two bookshelves with my brother 's school books and mine .
There are three bunk bed next to wardrobes .
There is a big window with curtains .
Finally , there are some posters and some shelf with my games .
My favourite sport is tennis .
This sport is an invidual sport , then you win alone and do n't win a team , but if you play tournaments in double the one who wins is the team .
This sport is very famous all over the world , but in Italy is n't very famous , becouse in Italy the soccer is more famous than the tennis .
But i know that a lot of joung people play tennis , i hope that the italian tennis player in a few years will be very famous all over the world , then you do n't wait you sign up in a tennis club and you will become a famous tennis player !
If you start playing tennis you go to a famous tennis club , or you choose the best tennis mister , who will introduce the tennis and you will the shots , including the forehand , the backhand , the smash and the service .
So you will become one of the most famous player all over the world and you will win a lot of tennis tournament , including the four slam : the Australian Open , the Us open , the Roland Garros and the Wimbledon .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
In 2 hours Mary 's plane was leaving and he had to go to the airport to stop her from going to Scotland .
He had to tell her she was in danger .
He went to the garage , and rode on his motorbike .
It was a cloudy , rainy day and there was a lot of traffic .
Though the road was wet and slippy , he rode his motorbike fast and skilfully , getting his way through the other cars and trucks .
My favourite sport is soccer . I like to play soccer because it 's a great sport .
It is great when you are in a cup and goes very far in the tournament .
It is also really fun to be with everyone who 's is whit in the team .
When you playing a cup you playing really much football and you are also very much with your friends .
When you go far in a cup you got to play a lot of games .
If you are going to begin playing football you need footballs shoes you also need protections for the legs .
If you starting this sport you need to think it 's funny to play it .
If you do n't think it is a funny sport you would not go it .
The best thing about football is that it 's a fun sport to play .
You should not play the sport just because you 're friends doing that , do it because you like to play .

Hi Alex I could n't wait until I see you
I really think taht we should go that new centre that you wrote about in your last email and do some of the activities .
I would prefer to do the sailing on the river , because as you know I never learn how to ride a bike .
But we could also try the climbing but it would be better if we could cimbing outside , in the countryside .
Perhaps on Saturday night we could watch a horror movie , as we both love , or comedy .
However if we not too tired at the time we could go out .
I will really like if my parents could take me to your house on Friday evening but I think that we have a party that night .
But I will try to convince they .
See you soon .
The future of public transport is one of the key issues large cities have to face .
Citizens want at the same time efficient and quick means of transportation , personalised solutions to meet their transportation needs , and the cheapest transportation cost .
Hi , Isabel .
How are you ? I hope you 're ok .
I have some to tell .
I have been living in New York city ! !

This place has some restaurants and sport bar 's when I can talk with latinos and I feel at home .
Emeil me soon and let me know how you are getting on next holidays .
See you soon . Kisses .
I think that public transport is much better for the enviromment than the private .
If the people travelled more often in public transport we would n't pollute so much .
I think that public transport is the future because many countries will have to allow the entrance in their towns to private cars for stop the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere in order to protect the planet and the health of their citizens .
So I do not agree with this afirmation , in mi opinion travelll by car is much more expensive and harmful to the environment than public transport .
After that kiss , Elizabeth was very surprised , but Jason was a little bit rigid .
Maybe he is sorry she thought , but why if she is perfect , she is everything that a man could want , so what happen .
-Are you ok ? - She says , a little bit afraid of his forthcoming word .
-Oh , amm- He gets a little bit of blush in his face- I … amm , I am sorry ! - He screams and his face gets totally red .
He seems different , she never imagined that Jason can be like that , she fantasy with someone , brave and strong , and she never foresees something like this , but she feel something for him , maybe she is in love with this guy .
-I'm sorry - he repeats again but more serious and with his normal face - Is cause , well is my first kiss ok ! , I can fight with Bloutums , Dragons , Two - Headed snake and everything that you can imagine .
But this thinks of l … lo … love , can put me very nervous- the blush comes again .
- jajaja- she smiles - it 's ok , do n't worry , it is my first kiss too , and I like it- she smiles again , but this time , the smile seems false .
Elizabeth apparent to be a very sweet girl , but Jason is not convince , because when he kiss her , he does n't feel nothing , he does n't feel that gravity disappear , and when his face turn red , he just put a face of horror and surprise , like if she was very sorry about kissing him .
Almost at the same time they kissed
-Hey , do n't run Snow
- But it 's very late Margarita , OMGG ( Oh my green god ) it is very late I 'm goanna die .
They stop in a dressmaker market .
-Why do we are here ? - Margarita says .

-ja amm second ?
Yes , the first one is the " Duque of Venomania " .
-Who is him ?
- I tell you later .
When they enter in the dressmaker market , Lucresia was n't there .
But there were a lot of beautiful dresses , in high - tech closets with lights .
-This dresses are made of textile fiber almost everything here is synthetic and portable for everyone - explain Snow .
- Wow , everything is beautiful , its make me feel like I am suspended in a dream of fairytale .
- Do you want to use one ?
-Yes but for what ?
-For the dance in the green palace .

My favourite sport is running .
I run everyday .
When I was running , I feel relax on it .
That is the reason why I love running so much .
Moreover , when I was running , I can through a lot of thing about myself or how to solve some of the problem from daily .
Therefor , running can let me feel happy .
In the past , cars are only affordable for the upper level while for the middle class and lower there are not many choice for them beside walk and public transportation .
Since technology and standard of living are improved , many people left the traditional habit in using public transportation and choosing car for several reasons .
The first one is to preserve time .
As we know public transportation has not a direct way to fulfill our all destinations then it force us to stop in many stations first , moreover we should take the other one to reach our destination so it is already obvious why using a car is better .
Secondly , public transportation usually very crowded and make us not feel safe since there is an opportunity for us to be theft .
Then by car we can enjoy the scenery , share laugh , change our destination by sudden and many more .
For these reasons , it can not be doubted if people think a car is more comfortable to be used rather than public transportation .
Since cars are affordable nowadays , a family can have more than one that make the number of car growing rapidly but they do not think further about the negative side effects that a car has .
Firstly , it leading us to global warming since the concentration of pollution are higher in many countries , moreover actually it is not only leading but also make global warming faster and also can threat our health .
Then roads are more crowded right now and there are so many traffics so people wasted longer time in the road , then it makes one of the positive points of using a car is gone and the importance of public transportation is needed .
While in the statement is written that public transportation will be left by many people , in my opinion is the opposite that public transportation is our future .
It can be proved by now that the willingness of people to use public transportation is higher , beside it is not as costly as using a car , the quality of public transportation are improved so citizen have no worry using it .
Would you like me to help you ?
There is n't any animal on the farm .
That is hardly surprising , it is close since 2005 .
You 'll have to take the cow by the horns and get some work done !
In the future , people will go out of the Earth .Because of the damage , people on the ground ca n't survive .
When they want to find foods , there will be nothing .
Even of the grass ca n't alive on earth .
Thought , but most people do not be the member of the team of alive .
Cause of lots of damage , but they did n't Take responsibility .
I wonder for sixteen years .
And I do n't know if they were change their mind in after the next fifty years .
Firstly , I agree about learning different concepts because you can analyse different opinions .
It 's not necessary to say the same words .
But you need , understand the main idea .
In other words , some professor when teaches different topics they explain the concepts and it 's difficult to learn .
Sometimes it 's so difficult say the same words for the students . I recommend read different ideas .
Anyway , if you read different books you can understand better .
In conclusion , it 's very important to learn the concept than saying something stupid ....
So , if you need techniques for learning you need to analyse and create your own words , this way you will never forget this definition .

Dear Carlos Sotelo ,
I am writing this letter because we need to improve the facilities in the gym .
In the gym they are many people .
The days that we have to do sports if the weather is good we do it outside but if the weather is bad we have to do in the gym .
That day we are many people and classes at the same time and sometimes we ca n't have the class comfortably .
Apart from this problem we have another problem that it is important too .
This problem is that some aparatus are brouken and the paint is bad .
For me the solutions to that 's problems are esey .
In the first problem you have to organis the time table in order to have 1 class in each time4 .
And the solution for the second problem is that you have to do maintenaits ouans a year .
I hope your positive awnser to me .
yours sincerely , Maximiliano Khachaturyan .

In the last year sales at Benton Electronics were in the first quarter of the year 500 and increased to 620 in the second quarter , in the third quarter sales maintained in 620 and in the last quarter of the year sales went down very quickly to 420 , as you can see sales were very unstables .
I just want to express about what I think painful , and I think coming back to your own home after many years of parting and seeing your closest person have departed is the most painful feelings ever .

My Life in University
The life in university have a lot of difficult and interesting things .
Of course , everything always have two - faced .
When I live in university , my life has become change a lot of .
Firstly , studying is very difficult because you have to accept new ways of studying- studying by myself .
In addition , my major is English so teachers will teach and explain by English , which I ca n't catch up on lessons well in the first time .
I was very inconfident about myself and i ca n't make friends well so I think that it 's too difficult to ask teachers or friends .
I always try to find out reasons which take a lot of time .
Moreover , I need to improve my skills such as reading , listening , writing , and speaking , they help me to catch up on my teacher ' s lesson .
Secondly , studying in university , I have to live far from house which make me be homesick , sad , and worried I have to live in dormitory with many strange friends , they 're very noisy and I have to share my room with my roommates .
It 's not convenient .
Everyday , I have to clean our room , wash clothes , I must take a lot of time to finish everything before I star learning .
The first time living here , i used to called my family and complained about here 's life .
However , life 's university have many conveniences .
Living alone , I have to manage money well .
Before I want to pay money for something , I always think carefully that I 'm really necessary or not .
Sometimes , I broke up nearly and I was really worried so I have to pay money suitably .
When I living alone , I have to save money because there are many situations which I have to slove without family , and you can become a good person with many good characters such as confident , independent , friendly .
Because my family always prepared everything for me when I lived with them so it 's very difficult to be independent .
But today , I have to do it , I have to solve my problem , manage money , wash clothes by myself .
In addition , I can be confident because teachers require everybody in class have to stand in front of class and speak English .
Living alone you have to make friends when you 're sad .
Studying new lessons from society .
Jogging the sport in the nature
My favourite sport is jogging .
During I go jogging I can think about all the daily thing in my life .
When I am in a bad mood I go jogging outside and hear how the birds singing .
For me jogging is very stressless .
At one day I go alone for me , so I can calm down or think through .
At an other day I go jogging with my best friend , so we talk a lot and have fun while we do sport .
Jogging is a sport you can start it every day .
You do n't need a lot of aquitment , so you do n't have to buy a lot .
I think for people who are fat , they can go jogging but a little bit slowler .
You have to notice that and go tomorrow jogging .
It is never too late to start .
Have fun !

There are several reasons why there is no future for public transport .
One reason is that travelling by car is more comfortable .
If you share your own car with other people , you will save money .
Another reason is that you can hear the music that you like in your car .
For all these reasons , I think that travelling by car is better .

We were stopped on the side and looked for solution .

Shopping facilities in Moral de Calatrava .
This report shows the sorts of shop which are localizated in Moral de Calatrava .
1 . Shopping cheaply .
It is though that Chinnesse shops are the cheapest by far .
We are offered a lot of bargains in this kind of shop .
But maybe , the most important thing is the variety of products which can be found there : from cleaning products until a little furniture .
2 . Fashion in little towns .
Traditional clothes : that kind of clothes can be expensive but if you want to live like in the past , you can put on that and you will have really fun although that clothes went out of style a lot of years ago .
Something more fashionable : there are also a few clothes shop were you can find a lot of sorts of fashionable Italian and Spanish designes .
If you need something for a special event like a wedding , you can go to three shops which are specialited in that .
3 . Farmer markets .
Every Saturday morning , this village organizes a market where people can buy some natural vegetables or fruit which had been grown up by local farmers .
That is the reason why its price is so low .
Some pieces of advice :
-Even though you can find a lot of bargains , do n't spent too much if you do n't need it .
-Be careful .
If you look like a foreign people , local people can try to rip you off .
-If you buy some clothes , assure yourself that they fit you and you like them enough to conservate .

There are many accidentally problems encountered by international students studying in Australia .
It is believed that the most important one of the problem is culture barrier .
Because of different culture backgrounds , the talking style of internaional students who come from different countries are various .
Meanwhile , different countries have different rules .
For example , people always walk on the right of the road in China .However , Australian 's rule specify citizen drive on the left of the road .
Secondly , loneliness would be a big problem when a person who leave their own country getting away from family members and close friends .
Thirdly , students ca n't be accustomed to western eating habits like burgers , pizza and bread .According to the unfamiliar environment students may lack the sense of security .
There will evaluate viable solutions to the problem .
The most important way is that individuals should participate in student activities which held by the students from the same nationality so that they may not feel lonely .At the same time they can also actively communicate with local students to acquire more information about Australia culture in order to suit quickly .

A game of gentlemen is my favourite game , yes I mean Cricket .
In my country we follow cricket as a religion .
Cricket is played by 11 players , which includes a captain , a wicket keeper and rest batsman and bowler .
Player who can bat and bowl is called all - rounder .
This game is played in three format i.e. Test Cricket ( 5 day game ) , One day Cricket and Twenty - Twenty .
Test cricket is old format and I love this format as it really tests the players skills and only best player can get success in this format .
But as this takes 5 days many people do n't have time to watch this game and its loosing its popularity in young generation .
One day cricket is played often .
My favourite sport is football .I think , this game is the most enjoyable .
Its popularity spreads all over world too .
There are many reasons behind it to be popular .
Everyone is able to enjoy the excitement throughout of this game the session .
The people who eager to play football must follow some basic rules which are described below :
1.A football player should be punctual and hard - working .
2.He should be disciplined .

There is no doubt that the man 's lives are evolved .
All thanks to new creations technologies , the innovation in the field of medicines and the new scientific discoveres .
To my mind our lives has been improved in these years by smarphone , satnav , digital TV , Internet ..
Let 's suppose a teenager of twenty - first century during the Middle ages .. do n't get out alive without Wi - fii !
First of all in the next 50 years the people 's life do n't resamble at all this .
As far as I 'm concerned we would be submerged by too many tools which will replace manpower and craft , in addition the globalization will lose cultural traditions of each country .
On the one hand I 'm for development on the other hand I would that the innovations will not destroy the old .
Often the evolution is return of origins however I hope that the man in the next years will be to do n't forget the past .
Apart from that I imagine the world with everything automatic , planes that took me from New York to Dubai in three hours and robot instead of the weiters in a restaurant .
To conclude I ca n't think which wonderful thing the man will do in spite I hope make the word even better !

I can not agree with the statment of " no future for public transport " provided that the premise is " travelling by car is more convenient " .
First of all , the public transport is more rather convenient than irvate car .
The subway reaches most part of the London , and people can travel many places .
The accessibility is not just improving underground , but also on the ground and bridging .
Therefore , public transport will have a brilliant future .
The environment is becoming a more and more burning issue , especially from many years to nowadays .
That 's because pollution has now reached critical levels and that 's why we must take it under control and solve it .
We already know that a great part of the pollution comes from the exhaust fumes of the transports that invade cities worldwide .
However , we can already fight this - waiting the developing of advanced technology which can better exploit renewable , sustainable energy . - for example taking advantage of public transports .
The best idea is still , obviously , valorizing the use of bicycles .
Apart from that , even greater is the pollution of seas and rivers .
Polluting them is like endangering the life of the whole world .
This is caused by the waste of factories , but also by the damages that tankers do not only to the sea , but to the mainland too .
In addition , what about domestic wastes , which are our reality ? We should all learn to manage our wastes , because each of us , in our own small , is a great damage for the environment .
In conclusion , I think it is never too late for saving our wonderful world .
Why not do it now ?
Hello Joe
It 's good to hear from you !
Well , in my hometown there is about a little more than half a million people .

But if you leave the city about 30 km , there are a lot of rivers and waterfalls .
My best regards !

My favourite restaurant is situated in Modugno .
It 's placed in a quiet street , so the restaurant is often very relaxing , especially between 8 and 9 pm .
The furniture consists in a set of chairs , tables and some sofas , covered with red clothes .
The restaurant appears very elegant and traditional .
Usually , there is no music in the restaurant .
The owner prefers to leave on only the TV , but often the dining room is silent .
In this way , customers can have the chance to have a conversation , without being annoyed by television or music .
I find it appreciable : I really love to talk to the people I 'm eating with .
Despite this , the resaturant is decorated with a full set of musical instruments , hanged up to the walls .
I really like it , because I love music and I enjoy trying to guess which instrument I 'm looking to .
You can eat different types of pizza , starters and pasta there .
Everything is delicious and very tasting , especially pizzas : they dress them in many different ways : I try a different meal every time I go there .
At last , it is not expensive at all .
she finally felt that she is wanted that she could do anything she wants , and that no one is more clever than another , they 're all the same .
The thoughts which people put in her mind was absolutely wrong she ca n't deny that those thoughts affected her badly , reached her to the point that made her hate herself .
The words they said to her was a killing ones , they colored her life in black , till it 's the only time to prove to them that she can do anything , she 's good at everything like them all , that she just did n't want to do like them all as she just hated the way .
that 's it , not for being non clever .
being unsuccessful in studying is a horrible thing , it affects man badly .
That was me , I never liked studying , I never found myself in those subjects , but it was n't the big deal to me , I hated is being seen as unsuccessful or a loser , as I was n't that , I knew that I 'm clever enough to study all these subjects and do well in exams so I can get high marks but they 're all did n't get that , they judged me for my marks but marks do n't form brains or thoughts , marks is n't the only way that makes you great now and then in the future .
whatever , In high school the senior year here in our country identify your future ; the college you 'll spend your life studying in and working by its knowledge , so I get that i should do all my best this year so my future could be better . and it happened I showed them all that I can do whatever I want even if the things I was n't like as they see me , and that all my previous marks was n't my best . I got high score and entered The faculty of Engineering which was the top college .
People thoughts have the power to make you feel the best feeling ever and literally the opposite , just do n't think about anyone 's thoughts but you , as you have the control of your life not anyone else .
your thoughts are the only ones that will make the differences , so take care of them only and believe in yourself so you could reach the prestige you 're looking for .
Do n't give anyone the opportunity to make you give up and continue in the successful life , Fight .

I 'm living in Taiwan , Taichung .
How is the area to take care of the environment ?
It build a lot of facilities for residents .
For example : Lots of Bicycles .
This provide people who want to go to a place that distance is not too long .
And it face another question : morality .
People probably destroy those bikes , and cause bikes become less and less .
But , fortunately , people living in this area all use these bikes carefully , so we do n't care so much that thing .
Second facility is public bus .
Large of bus all around the city .
When students finish their class , they take but to home .
Worker are off duty , taking bus to home , too .
And when the weekend is coming .
Family can take the bus to place to place , instead of driving .
It makes farther or mother more convenient !
Third , lots of green area .
Taichung have plenty of tree at the park .
So when children are playing around these tree , they can feel more healthy with pure air .
And that 's talk about the bigger area , Taiwan .
Taiwan has a complete traffic system .
Train , bus , Mass Rapid Transit , and air plant .
People living in Taiwan , no matter whether you are local people or not , you can use all of these facilities .
And lots of city government advocate protecting animals .

I am writing to tell you about the Spanish military academy .
This school located in Marin , where is in north Spain near Pontevedra .
The school is the Spanish institution in charge of training the Spanish navy officer class .
And it has been established in 1943.Moreover , there are not only the royal navy but also the royal marine crop .
Students have to study two parts which are engineering part and military part .
In engineering part , there are a lot of laboratories , which is help us to easy to understand about subject such as Physics , Chemistry or even Economics .
In military part , there are many obstacles and weapons for the marine corp .
And the are a lot of equipment for the navy cadets .
For example , the planetarium in a navigate room for learnt about the position of star , four small boats use for practiced the leadership and navigation in Pontevedra river , or even the simulation for maked the situations which are seldom happen .
To sum up , The Spanish military academy have a lot of equipment for teaching the future officers .
On the other hand , five years in school are not superficial because now there are not only the military subjects but also the engineering subjects .
But , I am really proud of my school .
There give me a lot of knowledge which I need to use in the future career .
A lot of people use public transport every day in this world , but some people prefer use your own car to go to the work , school , and whatever .
Some people have your own car , but prefer use public transport .
Today in the streets have a lot of cars , bus , motorcycle , other kind of transportation .
All the people should use your own car to go somewhere just when it 's necessary , because each car on the street is bad to our environment .
All the people should use public transport to reduce the number of the cars on the street

In 1960 , computers were very basic .
They were bigger and heavier than today and they were very expensive .
Its keyboard had a lot of buttons and its screen did n't have any colours .
Computers did n't have any programmes and resulted limited , boring and tedious .
In the present , computers are multifuncional .
For example , they have Internet access .
WiFi , port USB , among other things .
These computers are very popular .
They are faster and smaller than before and you need a mouse to use it .
Its screen has colours and HD

In my opinion , the public transport has future because this is cheaper than other transport , also its pollution is lower .
The car is a transport more comfortable than the public transport but is not sustainable , its cost is higuer and if all people move by car , The cities will be very pollutes .
Also , in the big cities , the public transport is more punctual than the car because this transport usually has its own lane , while if you use the car , you takes more because there are a lot traffic in your lane .
Other transport that can be very used in the future is the bike , this transport is cheap and ecological , also , more and more the cities are building a lot bike lane so is a good alternative .
For travelling other cities or town , in my opinion , the car will remain the transport most used , although the new transports could change this situation .
For the finish , I think that the transport most use in the cities in the future will be the bus , metro and bike and for travelling enter cities the car will remain the most used .
Dear James !
Thank you for inviting me there !
It was really enjoyable and funny .
I was especially delighted with national music and Latin American dances .
I would like to invite you to the celebration of my birthday in two weeks .
Bye !
Your dear , Vitaly
There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
Now a day , more and more people have their own car .
When they go out for work or other purposes , they choose to drive by themselves .
People do n't need to wait for public transport if they were driving their own cars .
It is not only convenient but also time saving .
With these benefits , it seems that there will be less and less people willing to take the public transport .

My favourite sport is football .
I play this sport since I was child , and today I still love it .
The dream of every person that play this sport , as well as a hobby , is to make it a profession , but very few people did it .
Nowadays I play football twice a week , Monday and Friday , because for me it is remained one hobby .
I like to play football cause for me , as well as one hobby , is one way to stand out of the world , of the problem that every day I have to face , and at the end it makes me calm and happy .
I recommend this sport to all people , because it could be , as me , one moment to distract from the world , one moment to spend without thinking about tmorrow .
The football could be one way to meet your friends , and to spend time with them .
Trust me , I 'll be right .
My undergraduate studies in Pharmacy at the University of Asia Pacific gave me a solid background in health care sector and chemistry , as well as strong theoretical framework , while allowing me to explore my personal interests in pharmaceutical technology .
This undergraduate work along with the diversified professional experience helped shape the specific research interests that now drive me to pursue graduate work in the field of Industrial pharmacy and gave me the opportunity to learn and work with the new medicines and delivery ensuring their safety and quality academic and research opportunities for my interest in pharmaceutics as a scientific career .

I Live in Egypt .
It has a lot of historical places .
The most historical place is the Pyramids , they were built since more than 7000 years ago .
If any tourist decide to visit the Pyramids , he / she shall enjoy riding Camel , horses or buggy .
Also having some pictures will be a great idea .
The pyramids are famous because of the way they are built , it was a great job by the Egyptians .
Many people think that for badly behaviour of young people are responsible their parents and they should be punished for that .
I agree with that only in part , because in my opinion there are some more reasons .
First of all , when children are small , they are polite and always listen parents , for example they are doing homework , going to sleep in regular hours and back home after school .
This is a time , when parents could create behaviour of their children , because when they grow up , they are beginning rebel and do things which are good in their opinion .
Secondly , for behaviour of older children like teenagers have an impact other factors , it are not only their parents but other people , whose surrond them .
It is a time when children must choose , which people are good or bad , which way they will go to difficult situation for example they will be drink alcohol or they will have fun without any suplements .
When they choose bad , they could began stopped do things which were important for them in previous period in their life .
In summary , I would like to point out that the most impact for young people have their own , because life is a time when people only choosing .
Parents are very important , because they can suggest some solutions , but final decision must undertake their children .
Great Wall is a great military construction in China , as known as a miracle in the history of ancient human construction .

This week was a little bit difficult because it was the beginning of classes , I got up early to be on time for my classes and to start with all the enthusiasm in the new semester .
The next day , on Tuesday was hard for me to get up , but the simple fact of seeing my classmates it was so much easier .
I arrived at the school with all the energy , and I decided that this semester will be better than the other .
Thus the classes have just begun with new teachers and others who have already taught me .
What heavy was that teachers have already given us all homework for the week .
Later , I went to my house with my mom and I helped her make the meal and did the clean up .
After that , I did my homework because I had a lot of and it was pretty hard .
So every day I kept awake .
My dad told me do your best and if this semester going well for me , my dad will give me a tablet because I really need it .
So this is my week .
However on Saturday I went to English classes in the evenings .
Later , my parents , my brother and I went to turn around to relax us from all the stress of the week .
Finally , on Sunday I rested at home with family .
Every second , every day , every week , every year , the life goes on and the human discovers a new thing .
The scientists try to make people 's life easier but that 's harmful for people 's health because that make people do n't move and more fat .
In future , The cars will fly and be faster .
we wo n't use oil as a fuel .
we will find a new resources for energy which will be clean and cheap .
The renewable and new energy is clean and so cheap , we can use the sun rays to generate electricity for houses and cars .
The computers will write what you think in , the mobiles will be smaller and less weight .
The tourists will travel to another plants , The people will live at moon and under seas or oceans .
Working as an ITC si very exciting because you need to program all , is like a challlenge , although you can do varied things . You can be in duty in your house and deal with your boss in the cellphone so do n't be alarmed if your son 's bother you .
Is a little streesfull when you have a lot of work .I hope when I have me job be in charge of security IT department .
It 's a very worthwhile job .
I agree with that opinion because I do n't like shopping at all .
I think it 's very silly when you go to the store and you have no money .
But you want to see all goods and maybe buy one of product .
It looks very stupid .
But if you have much money you can go and by something from the fact that you really need .
Everyone has an opinion on this statement .
There is no accounting for tastes and I can not answer for everyone .
i do n't know my name .i do n't know my age all i know about that i want to be a great woman , i want the world to hear my voice , to prove that i can do it i can do any thing i am not weak i have woman power

Once upon a time , a young boy called Michael , was walking opposite of a beautiful lake .
When , he saw into the water , he found a little ill frog .
After that , Michael decided to bring it up because the frog was very ill .
The frog got well while I was at home for two months .
However , Michael discovered that it was a bad wizard .
The wizard attacked him and he went away from home .
Michael closed the door and kew at that moment he had made a mistake because he lost his house .
It was a sunny and hot day , Peter decided to go to the waterfront promenade and have a walk .
He was feeling so free because of the fresh air .
Suddenly , he heard a high - pitched scream .
Then he saw a woman started to jump over the enclosure !
Peter thought that he must do something quickly to avoid her from committing suicide .
He shouted out loud for help but no one was around him .
So he contacted the police for help immediately .
In a flash of an eye , the police came .
At last , the life of the woman was saved by the police and the police thanked Peter for confirming them .
The one I most admire is called Ronaldinho , a football player that in my opinion is the best of all time .
He won only one gold ball , but he should have won more than that .
He mostly played with number 10 even thouhg he also played with numbers 80 , 45 .
He was born in Porto Alegre , in 1980 , and played in several teams like Barcelona or AC Milan .
The skills he make are wonderful , he know everything about football , his passes were fantastic , he passed the ball even with the back !
Even though most of people think that Messi or Ronaldo Nazario are even better than him , other people think same as me .
There are 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms .
The kitchen looks like small and simple .
The living room shares area with dining room .
We have a small garden .
My mom likes growing plants such as vegetables .
it all started when I found a book on the bus .
This book made me interesting and I begging reading more and more while I read the more I love it this time everything did not matter to me I want to finish the book as soon as possible I do not know the end but I want the end of the book was amazing but the same time I do not finish the book because the mystery to open up finished in .
In the end a lady interrupted me and I was angry about the situation .
that was the reason I do not finish the book
Nowadays our world is fighting everyday against diferrent problems , one day there is the problem of violence , one day the atmosphere conditions or many others .
Today we can try to imagine how our lives can change in the next 50 years , if it will be better or worse .
In my opinion everyone 's life will have a great improvement , from the economic point of view but also from the social and cultural one .
It is known that in the future will come the day in which any kind of unrenewable resource will finish .
But I imagine that in the next years we can begin to spread the use of alternative resources , as the eletricity given by the light of the sun rays .
Or in addition , we can use the energy given by the environment , as the wind or the inorgainc rest .
Maybe there will be also great new discoveries from the medicine that will make disappear any kind of diseases .
To sum up , I think that we have to expect a great future in which men will regain possession of his whole capability and thanks to it he will change everyone 's lives in best .

I 'm interested in sport;football .
Because it 's the most common sport all over the world as well as I 'm good at football , so I play football with my friends every weekend always play on Tuesday evening .
Also , it 's good for fit and health .
I 'd like giving you some advice about how to start playing sport .
I think it 's good idea if you buy some kits for football and training with your friend before match at home or playground for two or three days .
Next , you can play with anyone on confident and control match .
moreover , sometimes why do n't you run in the morning ?
In my opinion , it 's useful to play football .
THANKS
I understand what you mean because cars are so convenient as you said .
You can go anywhere , anytime you want .
You do n't need to care about time tables .
Also , during your journey , you might be able to stay night in your own car .
But nowadays , cars are one of the reasons to cause the earth warming and air pollution .
Car companies try to spread electric cars but it seemed to take a long time .
And some people have already switched to use public transport like trains or buses .
Moreover , it 's still popular to travel long journey with trains or ships because the scenery you can see from them are totally different from the one from cars .
According to these reasons , I do n't think there is no future for public transport .
" Annabelle " is a horror movie which i am going to watch this Saturday .
I am wondering if i will be scared after the movie .
The movie is about a doll called Annabelle which was closed in a museum from Conecticut where she is visited by a preist who blesses her twice a month .
John From finds the perfect gift for his pregnant wife : a beautifull colection doll dressed in a wedding dress .
Unfortunatelly , in a horribble night the couple"s house was invided by a satanist group who attack them and leave just blood behind them .
The satanists invoced an eavel entity that is capabale of the worst things ... Annabelle .
After Mia gives birth to her doughter Lilly , Annabelel wants to kill her .
Even the preist doesn 's know how to help the unhappy familly .
Everyone is terryfied and find out that a demon is attached by the doll .
Idon't know the end of the story but i don;t think that is a happy one ...
The aim of this report is to highlight how the citizens care of the environment , in order to give suggestions to keep this area clean .
In the matter of that , information concerning what people do , or could do , are going to be shown .
Few people who live in the suburban areas have the following routine :
1 Check if your dog or anyone else 's pet damages streets or gardens .
2 Divide wet rubbish from the products which can not be recycled .
3 Denounce those who leaves rubbish in the wrong spaces .
Disadvantages :
If the majority of citizens , including the ones who live in the city centre , had followed these ideas , this city would have been surely cleaner .
Unfortunately , deeper problems are linked to the difficulty that all the inhabitants respect those principles .
Some thought that volunteers should involve careless people in many project to keep their city attractive and marvelous .
It is proven that to be a part of a project always make people feel useful .
I would , therefore , recommend this idea .
Nowadays we can see that each time more public transport need to improve the quality of your services , the people daily need this kind of transport go to work , go to school and in general depend so much of the public transport .
The government can to improve the public transport making a great investmenting like changing the old vehicles for new and increase the number the bus , trains and build more bus station and trains station this kind the action will help a lot the quality of the public transport for population and will become the life of the people more easy .
Today many people prefer to travel by car than public transport because of the bad quality services , the bus , the trains are full and many times are until dirty and late .
However if this situation not change and if our government not take providence about this important subject will be the end of the transport public and will more convenient to use car .
I am writing this letter because we have to improve the gym of the school .
The gym has many problems that we are gouing to explain :
the first problem is that we do n't have enough aparatous for all of the students
the second problem is about that same aparatous are not working well because the school did n't the manteinace long time ago
For the first problem in my opinion , the school have to buy some others aparatus because there are not enough for all of the students
For the second problem the solution for me is to hire someone to do the maintenance and say to all of the students to take care of the machines of the school
I hope my proposal wiil be useful for you
I look forward to hearing from you soon

I work as freelancer journalist , prepare reports dealing with a whole situation in the city of Jerusalem , and publish my reports in many of the websites .
I am also committed to preparing monthly reports for newspaper supplement " The Voice of Women " which issued by the WATC " Women 's Affairs Technical Committee , and I have the cooperation with the Environment and Development the magazine which issued by Center for development work " Maan " , annd other web sites and news and media organizations .
the world is sadly lacking in an environmental mind in consequence , it caused the global warning which been the most important global problem it does n't mind to more than three quarters of the world population .
Currently we have got more than six different types of banks in our streets but as far as I know it is not sufficient to meet the needs of the environment because nowadays we do produce a lot of different materials , all of them overproduced and we do only learn this education in our home in our childhood , accordingly I am one of the few worried teenagers in the world about it so I really do help the environments as far as I can .
Frist of all at home we recycle plastics , glasses , papers and cartons , oils , clothes , batteries , organics in an especial composting bank where we avoid burning or burying in excess those scraps with other materials and finally all the other things are sends to an especial tip where we avoid to drop it anywhere . then when I have time and I see a senior citizen in the street introducing their scraps bag in an wrong bank I explain them who they have to recycle and who important it is for our environment carefully recycle it
A couple of years ago , I hardly could see any bins in supermarkets and houses .
Nowadays , I see everywhere bins and even a small kid of 3 years being teached to put unwanted materials in the bin .
It is truly an amazing experience and how much progress my small village has had done in 2 years of time .
Even though , there are not provided separate bins for different categories of dirt .
So , We can easily see people throwing everything in the same bin .
In spite of throwing dirt in a bin we also making some harm to environment unknowingly .
As there are different kinds of materials , dirt . some are renewable and some are not .
In my opinion , in the next 50 years , humanity will increase and there wo n't be resources enough for everybody .
There will be on another planets , for example the moon , many citadels inside an enormous domes .
Then , I suppose that in every country will be used much more renewable energies instead nuclear energies for reassure a secure future for the next generations , and maybe everybody will use electric car for decrease the atmospheric pollution .
The people 's live will change even by policy and the economy .
I hope that in the future there will not be any war by the economic crisis .
I think that public transport has a future , indeed travel in car is much more comfortable , because you do n't have to walk to take a bus or the underground .
But there 's a thing , no one have enough money to buy a car or maybe two ; that 's why there 's a lot of people who prefer the public transport .
Perhaps in a future public transport it can be more comfortable for the rest of the people who does n't have a car .
I think that there is n't for public transport because nowadays the people usually use your private car .
This is some adventeges such us it is more comfortable and fast .
when you travel by bus you must have a timetable and it is less comfortable than travelling by car .
However when you go by car you can take your car whenever you want .
Sometimes private transports is cheaper if you go is other people .
for example when you go by car you can go with other people so you pay less money for gasoil .
On the other hand , private transport are damaging for planet because we must take care of the planet . we can help to prevent the contamination of the enviroment , if we take travel public transport which do n't pollute .
At the moment , there are more one car to person , it is a problem for me because people do n't take cure envarioment .
they prefer to be comfortable .
in conclusion using public transport produce less damage to the environment and most people prefer .
I want to describe a famous actor from my country , he is Sergey Bezrukov .
He participates in many interesting movies and operas .
Some of them I saw , when was a young girl .
He has very important skills for the actor , these are charisma and charm .
What is more , he is a good husband and father for his children .
I think he deserved to be famous , because he is a very talented person .
Now he has opened his owned company .
I am plannning to visit his company .
One of his interesting film about musician , which was popular for 1980 - 2000 years .

Life is unpredictable and unforseen .
The immense possibilities of life give us opportunity to explore life but some times it lead to threat and dangers to our life .
We surely pray for the best life of our dear and near ones .
But insurance is also necessity and invetable for peace of mind .It gives us surety to live life securely .
It just not only to save our life but also secure assets like houses cars etc .
The insurance for non accidental death is known as general insurance and for life is known as life insurance .
But we still sold it not bought it .
Number of countries give attention and provide secure life to their citizens .but our country still under insurance .
Government should play key role by providing trustworthy organization surveyors loss assessors etc .
To aware people by run awareness campaign .
To provide insurance at nominal prices.and claim polocies should be easy .Give surety so that people can accept and trust the insurance companies .
Fdi can play important role in it .
It give competition to national companies .By virtue of which they work properly mannerly and give better option to policy holders.people can always buy nominal premium we should aware them about the types of insurance as well as benefits of the insurancce .
Soccer is one of the most games in the world and I like it very much .

In fact , I really enjoy it when I play soccer for many reasons .
First , soccer is very famous game in the world and a lot of people like to play soccer and I try to play like them .
for example , I can watch many matches a day and I enjoy it when I watch famous players such Cristiano Ronaldo with Real Madrid and Messy with Barcelona .
Second , soccer is very interesting game because when I play soccer I feel very happy .
Moreover , soccer help human body to be very healthy because when someone play soccer his organisms become strong .
Finally , I like playing soccer because most of my friends like me play soccer too much everyday that makes me love it too much .
I would like to say for anyone wants playing soccer to be very careful when he plays it because it may cause a lot of injures , but in the same time it is very nice game .
Hello John !
I read your e - mail , so let 's talk about books ! I usually read a book on my free time , because I prefer story than short articles .
Recently I read four great books about Shoah , they were very interesting , my favourite was : " The Book Thief",I read it for school , but I have already saw the film of this book .
It 's a very mooving book , but it is n't difficult , I think that 's for teenagers , but is also good for adults .
I love the thing , that in this book , there are a lot of German words , so I also could improve my German ( I go to the languages high school ) .
And what about your book ?
What are you reading ?
I hope you 'll answer me soon .
Bye Serena
Last Friday I 've visited Balla without any planning .
I usually wake up at 10 am at that day my father called me at 8:00 am and asked me to go Balla with them .
He usually avoids me in this kind situation .
Nowadays he treats me as botheration .
That is why I was very surprised .
The reason he told me to go Balla is Noman will feel alone there as Badhon and her mother is not going .
I was in a bit hesitation latter decide to go .
Actually I do n't have enough courage to say no to my father .
I got ready very quickly so I did n't do my morning exercises .
We have been told earlier that Abul kaka has got a very nice PAJERO Jeep from office nonetheless the performance of the vehicle was awful that day .
It shut down at the road for several times while we were on the way .
So I was feeling very anxious that if the car fail in Aricha highway .
Because I was so sure Abul kaka and Noman will prefer Aricha highway rather than the Singair road .
I do n't feel comfortable in hi - ways for many reasons .
Those are the most risky roads of the country . if there is an alternate way I always use that .
That 's why when I go to village I like to use the Singair Road than DHAKA - ARICHA highway .
My father also uses this road .
When I was a youngster , my father and I rode motorcycle to visit our place using this road .
As I was a kid I fall asleep sometimes .
May be for that I have a high regard for the road .
noman engaged the front seat .
Though he was unwilling to sit there as because abul kaka or my father should be seated there .
But they insist him .
So we four were occupying the back seat uncomfortably .
When the car stopped to take oil at a service station near Gilando , my father asked me to go the very back benches of the jeep .
I thought I should n't come as because those benches were disgraceful for me .
I feel like I 'm depriving by my family .
If I were in a better position it could not happen to me .
Peoples humiliate me in many ways because I do nothing for earnings .
I found it very painful when my parents do it to me .
I keep my brain cool and try to overcome the situation by thinking one day I will prove myself . I know who I am and what I 'm doing .
My thoughts are unquestionably better than others .
Hence I 'm waiting for good time .
We reached our home at 1:00 pm as well as planned to back Dhaka at 4:00 pm .
It gives the impression that only going and coming in a big car is the main purpose of the tour .
That was ridiculous .
That the I spent most of my time with Noman with his over talking habit .
My usual stance with this kind of person is to listen .
We visited nagar chak with much anticipation .
In this season I kike to see the sun shine .
The crystal clear and mild sun is very favorite of mine .
While I was listening noman I was discerning that I should question more .
When he talks he has done many mistakes because of his over talking habit .
at 4:00 pm we set for Dhaka was an early move because of faulty car .
I fall asleep as soon as we crossed jhitka bazar in addition when I wake up we had crossed Tora bridge .
We stopped our car to a road side tea stall to take tea .
Than we set for Dhaka .
We talked about a lot of things .
When we talked to our seniors I think I should control myself though they talked unreal things .
They prefer industrialization over nature .
At the same time they also keep saying that nature was more green and vigorous in our time .
A never ending argument took places and thus we reached Dhaka .
Travelling or moving from place to another by car is much more convenient for a man than public transport .
By car you can go whenever you want on time with no need to wait for hours at the stations for bus or subway .
It is faster and cleaner and much more comfortable .
For example , if you are in a hurry and want to catch the place you are heading to , you can drive as fast as possible .
You can have some other choices that you can stop to buy something : water , juice or snack if you get hungry your way or thirsty .
You even can take a rest for awhile pleasingly to sleep or to have a nap .
You would n't suffer anymore from the trouble or annoying stuff on bus most of the time like : no room for you to sit , bad smell people can make , or get bothering or bushing .
It 's convenient already .
But , on the other hand , because of recently traffic has been terrifically unbearable ; cars are so many ; very noisy , unclear air produced has become the public transport better to save earth .
In all over the world people always need advices to keep looking after their environments .First , the municipal should do workshops in schools and universities providing students by tips that should help us to make our environment clean .Second , they should make awareness campaigns about environment ; for example , telling people to put their rubbish in waste papre basket which helping workers to recycling it easily .Finally , to stay healthy we need a healthy environment .
I used to find a kung - fu sensei to teach me .
But at the region where I live I had not found .
Sundly , started krav maga class in a gym close to my house .
I did not think two times .
I went there and sang .
I discovered a new world .
It is a good self defence ... it is object , simple and fast .
Krav maga teaches how to control ourselves in hard situations .
Sometimes we are with people that we love .
When someone wants to hurt our relatives or friends , we must do something .
There are a lot of bad people in the street .
If it was not true , the life would be so better .
The most exciting day of my life was when I and my sister discovered that we would spend one week on a cruise with our friends ! that was a very beautiful Holiday !
We spent a lot of time together every day ; we visited some fantastic cities in Greece like Santorini , Athens and many others .
In Italy we also visited Bari and Venice too .
Every day we spent time on the beach and across the sea .
Every evening we went to the restaurant on the cruise .
Meals were very good and also in the morning I ate English breakfast or eggs and bread because I wanted to change my routine while I was on the cruise .
I think it 's the most exciting holiday I 've ever spent and my favourite too .
I and my classmates with our teachers and other classes went to the cinema to see the film " Fantastic Boccaccio " .
It was an interesting experience to go to the cinema to my class and see in a film what I have studied during the Italian lesson and understand better the stories of Boccaccio , one of the most important Italian writer .
Seeing the film we have had the possibility to watch the characteristics of the main characters of Boccaccio and the different places where the stories took place .
In my opinion the film was made in a very good way : the registers of the film ( they are two ) tell us five novels with only one main protagonist : the love in every situation .
The registers of the film said that they want to create a film without time , and they were able to create this .
The scenes of film , the costumes and the music are very beautiful and I suggest this film to all of my friends .
According to the past century , we have seen lots of change in the world .
It 's obvious that nowadays is really different from 50 years ago , so we can predict that the people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
When it comes to change , we can think of what way of our lives is still inconvenient that it can probably change .
Most of the labours will probably have been represented by machinery , the people who is lack of academic might be very hard to get a job , the knowledge might be demand if the people live in the future .
There are some issues that make worried , the environment is getting worse , we have to come up with the methods to solve this and save our Earth .
The relationship among the countries is also significant , as we can see discord is among the countries , hoping that it will not draw the war .
television entertains as well as it will educate the people .
These days are educating themselves by watching the television .
Televison not only provide entertainment it will give lots of information about the happenings around the globe .
Channels like national geographic and animal planet will tell us the animal behaviour and the origination of species .
Few programmes some intellectual programs will increase the creativity of the people
When Michael wake up that morning he feels , a strange smell in the air , he do not know what is the origin of that strange smell but , in his noose , he receive a kind of sign something bad happened .
Very quickly he went of and try to put of his head of that sensation , but ... the smell , the feelings , the sign ... but " what ?
what is that ? " he thing .
He star watch the kids there running , playing , laughing a lot , the same couple of yesterday talking about love , the sadness in the city .
With a great effort sate down on the grass , he feels tired , and has a little sensation of pain in his boson , site there with many sounds on air , he star recall ... his face is changing is dark , he has now a clear image of all , when opened the door of the house his girlfriend is there dying on the floor , Michael remember all , the fight , the lays , the screams , the knife ... the blood ; but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
The diabetes is the increasing of the glucosa in the blood , The have two types , first the Diabetes Type 1 that is predent in childrens , pacient needs insuline every day , also this diabetes is caused by the destruction of the insuline realized by the person 's immuny siste .
The Diabetes Type 2 is present in adults people , the insuline is generated but this not work in the body , so the amounts glucose is storage in the body .
This diabetes is caused by the bad alimentation of the people or because the people have a bad life .
So it is necessary to eat vegetabl and fruist and also to do ejercises .
My view is that public transport is good because it has prevent pollution which is good for the public .
May people can think travelling by car is more comfortable for them .
However , they must understand travelling by car is not any kind of exercise .
if planned to travel by public transport people will walk to bus station and get down from the bus and walk for necessary thing .
So my opinion is good for both parties

Hi readers of international sports monthly magazine .
I wrote to sponsorize my favourite sport , the most beautiful sport in the World ,
basketball .
basketball is a complete sport , aerobic and anaerobic .
it 's a team sport , the team it 's made of 5 people and you need a ball and a hoop .
I enjoy this sport because I love team sports and games with a ball .
Some people say that basket it 's only for tall guys
but it is n't true , in the A league in Italy we have different players not very tall
like 1 meter and 60 , so if you love this game you can play it no matter what
find only a ball and a hoop and play it .
If you want to start this sport , find a friend that can teach you the basic movements and how to pass and shot
than the practice makes the rest .
if you train and you have willpower nothing can stop you .
Nowadays basketball is spreading around the World .
I hope that the amount of players will increase and increase every day more .
so let 's play basketball .
Ryan Gordon loves all sports but he works hard at school too .
At the moment he is doing three A levels at camden college .
He is going to go to university next year .
At the weekend he usually plays football or basketball and this year he is learning how to roch climb .
He goes twice a week to the local climbing center .
School is finishing in two weeks and next summer he wants climbing in Scotland .
I have the best friend when I was a student at high school .
We studied hard together to prepare the university exam , shared about our problems and almost things has relatived with us .
It 's great time for me .
He made me happy and safe .
He seemed as my boyfriend .
The first year of the university , I showed my love to him .
Unfortunately , he refused me .
I had an affair love .
Day by day , I tried to forget my love in his quiet .
I did n't call , send message and met him .
Although I did well for a long time , one day , he contacted again with me , so I did n't ignore him .
He said that he wanted to be the best friend as before .
But no , what I can do it ? I still love him , even my love become bigger .
What I should do ?
Should I show my love again ?
Last week from September 11 to September 21 , we had a minivaction .
From September 11 to September 14 , I did nothing besides watching TV , taking care of my little sister Ellie and chat with my friends .
On the rest of the boring week , I solved a 1000 pieces puzzles .
On Sunday , my family and I went to Causeway Amador then to Albrook Mall .
After the examns finished , I went home and had nothing to do , so I thought that I needed to watch my dramas because it was a week I haven't watch them due to the exam week .
So after watching all my dramas , I had nothing to do .
From September 12 to September 14 , I was too lazy because I was tired of the exam so I was all day laying on the sofa doing nothing apart of watching the TV and chat with my friends .
Besides I needed to take care of my little sister Ellie , who is very cute and funny and right now she is always trying to get up and stand and walk .
On the rest of the boring week , I was watching TV and suddenly my cousin found some pieces of the puzzle inside the cabinet , so I decided to solve my Paris puzzles with my sister , which was less than a half solved for about one year but it had too much color in the sky so I did n't finished then a year ago .
We began to solve it again and took us the whole week to finish it .
While solving the puzzle , I decided to count how much pieces was left , after counting them I realized that five pieces were missing .
I was too angre because I was finishing the puzzles and five pieces were missing so I began to search the whole house for the five pieces but did n't find it .
On Saturday , I finished my puzzle but with five pieces missing but I was happy too .
I finished it .
On Sunday , my father planned to take my whole family to Causeway Amador .
Also my uncle , aunt , grandfather and cousins went with us .
After arriving to the Causeway , my brother and my cousins went to drive bicycle for one hour .
I was hoping that my father can teach me to drive the car but was not possibly because we went to Albrook Mall to eat and my father did n't want to return to Causeway Amador to teach me drive .
Mini vacation can be fun but sometimes boring because you haven't planned anything for the vacation .
The best thing I did was to solve my beautiful Paris puzzles and went to Amador with my family and have a good time with them .
Mini vacation are a break for us to have a fun and good moment with our adorable and lovely family and friends .
when I was child , I wore usually blue , grey and red colours .
My bedroom is blue and orange , the colours of my toys when I was child are different .
I chose always my clothes because only me know my favourite clothes and when I was child my toys .
Now I wear different colours for example black , blue , grey and other .
Maybe they will change
Pompei - the destroyed city
I 'm sure you 'll agree Pompei is the most important archeological site in the world .
It was destroyed by a vulcanic eruption in 75 BC .
Vesuvium - this is the vulcano 's name ! - covered it with a lot of cinder so that walls , houses , food , clothes , corps of citizens has been preserved as well they were .
You can walk through the same streets and enter in the same shops the romans entered some centuries ago !
It is n't incredible ?
Besides is possible to book special tours in which there are guides dressed like pompei 's citiziens .
I love the overnight tour , in which only fires light the ruins .
There is an unique athmosphere !
In my opinion anyone could n't come to Italy without visiting Pompei .
If you come , I promise you 'll never forget it !
I do n't think there is no future for public transport .
Especially in urban , for example , Taipei city in Taiwan .
People who lives there almost know the convenient public transport called MRT , it 's fast , cheaper and does n't have to find the parking lot .
Besides , it 's harmful and makes earth environment more worse for emission so much carbon dioxide .
That will cause the global warming .
So , it is better to use public transport .
But , if you live in the country , car may be essential , because it 's will spend so much money to buy the tickets if their family have many people .
So , I think the government should have to draw a proposal to solve the problems between the use for urban and counry .
And think deeply the problem about protecting the environment .
I love my small family .
My family members are very helpful and supportive .
My parents are very support .
My parents are my best friends and guides .
If any problems faced , i 'm went to my parents and say the problem , there are solve the problem .
My family is my world .
My parents are the good guides .
There are my role model.some times we were go to the tour programs , it 's very happy moments .
My mammy told the story in night .
Mom make the special foods in festivals .
my family is a nuclear family .
My family is great .
Steve Ramsay work in the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D and live in Washington D.C. after the Battle of New York .
Someday , an S.H.I.E.L.D. 's agent was attacked by the ghost .
After that Steve become an America captain to protect the world again .
But he does n't know he is involved in a conspiracy .
He meets a strong opponent who is winter soldier when he wants to find out the wirepuller .
Walking every day is what I enjoy .
Besides to be an excellent exercise , is also the more comfortable , because it allows me to concentrate , to be with myself , talking and praying to God in each step in the morning .
I woke up 5H00 o'clock in the morning ,
I consider this is the best time to do sport , taking into account that the pollution is down at that time .
There is not so much traffic , and my senses and lounges perceive and respire all the smell that flowers , land , the First , I walk slowly and then I begin to walk as soon as possible to improve my fitness and I end walking 5 turns in the park .
What I really enjoy it is to lie in the grass .
It is in this moment when I get to talk to God .
I feel that he is near to me that he listens to me every word that I pray .
Doing so , I begin my routine day , come back home , begin to do my breakfast , followed by the lunch , because I have to get to work at 9H00 o'clock .
It is an activity that goes according to the capacity of each one , that doing it each morning improvement our health and move away all the bad of our body .
The graph below gives information about seasonal sales for ice - cream of different places in ice cream van and indoor swimming pool in Jan to Dec .
Overall , average of 5000 dollars of year about ice cream van .
In addition , indoor swimming pool sales have a slightly declining from 2012 to 2014 .
First , the graph showed an upward trend to ice cream van , and in 2014,it has the largest percentage of sales nearly 5500 dollars in Jul - Sep .
No matter what year , its lowest level always in Jan - Mar .
May be because this paragraph of time the weather was cold , the purchaser greatly reduced .
We can be seen from the diagram , the highest peak in the has increased year by year , as the low as .
Second , for indoor swimming pool , it generally appear wavy falling , from 2500 dollars in 2012 to 2000 dollars in 2014 . We can infer , it will not rise sharply , and it is impossible to fall sharply .
Most people like to have their own car , because they think is more comfortable and flex .
You can go out from your house and take your car park and leave to your job and park very close .
But I think that the future is the public transport , we need preserve nature , this is an imperative for our world , then the solution have to take the point that the governments do more invest in public transport , so the people do n't need to get a car for being able to have a job and do n't need it for normal development of their lives .
As well , we have to promote that the people get jobs close their accommodation or get the accommodation close to the jobs , because we have too much pollution and we could reward the companies that hire staff close to the place of job , maybe in a circle of 4 kilometres , as well we could reward the people that turn their accommodation for live near to the job or for going there by a bicycle .
Maybe this sound a bit crazy , but whatever solution will be good , we only must make our minds up for able to look across .
What the fine weather today !
What a fine day !
It 's April now , and spring is finally .
The sun shines bright , snow has melted in the March .
Birds returned from warm countries .
They sing joyfully and build the nests .
People look happier .
They feel tired after long snowy winter .
In the March we set forward our watch an hour ago .
Summertime was first converted in 1900 year .
Days are getting longer but night are getting shorter and lighter .
We convert our watches an hour ago in October .
It 's pleased some people because they will be able to sleep an hour more .
I like spring and always wait for it and wait for summer holidays with impatience .
Summer is really little life .
As soon as I pass all exams I will travel .
As they say in English proverb < travel broadens the mind>. In summer you can switch off of daily routine , relax , have a talk with friends .
I did n't decide as yet where I will spend the summer .
It became a big problem now .
I always want to see the world , to swim in the Ocean .
However I am stopped last tragic developments in foreign countries .
I think , it 's better and safer to go to Black sea , to Crimea or to Kuakas .
My friends have bought ticket to Sochi yet .
It 's the best , the most beautiful and the most comfortable resort in the South .
It 's possible , I will join them , because I have never been in Sochi and everyone should visit this wonder city one time of their life .
What is my favorite sport ?
Well , I 've played martial arts .
I 've been doing that for around twenty years .
Some martial arts are not really sports .
They 're more for self - defense but for what I do , and my way to stay healthy , is martial arts and running .
As far as watching , that 's a good question .
I would suppose I would have to say , in Japan Sumo is my favorite sport for watching .
I 've never tried it myself .
I would have to probably be three times as big as I am to even begin to qualify for something like that but , yeah , I enjoy watching it a lot .
I have to start saying that I never imagine swimming like my favorite sport , because until my back 's injury , I practiced other sports , I most like extreme sports like downhill , skateboarding martial arts like Aikido , jiujitsu or ninjutsu , but for my injury I have to start swimming and now I love it .
The think because I enjoy these sport is I feel free when I am in the water , it is so relaxing and I red it is the most completely sport because you work the whole body .
If you want to start swimming I think you should looking for a swimming teacher because if ca n't swim , you must need it , and if you can swim but not well , if you are not on practice and know your swim style is not the best I recommend you a professional assistance .
More time that you do n't have that assistance is going to be more difficult improve your style and enjoy swimming more because if you really know how to swim are going to have more resistance in the water .
Last week was a hard week for my wife .
She works at a language school in local University .
It is just the beginning of winter vacation courses , so she has been struggled with a lot of work and students .
I think , that may the reason she had the Sleep Paralysis last night .
In Korea , we call it ' Ka - Wee - Nool - Rim ' which means being pressed by ' Ka - wee ' ghost .
Yes , she actually felt as if someone was pressing down on her chest by hands .
Even she was not able to lift single finger tip as if she was turned into a stone statue .
She opened her eyes .
Then , she realized that four indistinct strangers were staring at her as standing just beside bed .
She was so scared and frightened .
She tried screaming and calling me who was sleeping peacefully beside at her .
But she could n't .
She could n't open mouth , say anything at all .
Even worse , two of them started whispering on her ears , die … die ..
Well , actually it did n't happen .
She just dreamed a terrible nightmare because I was not sleeping .
I was watching a YouTube clip by my iPad .
She reproached me for not awaking her up despite she had been calling me so eagerly .
But it is not true .
She had n't called me at all .
It was just a dream , very real like .
Most of those dreamers claim that it is like real .
They think they really opened eyes and awaken since it is too vivid and detailed .
Often they explains and describe the scene in detail like a cup on table , friends who watching TV beside them , room light and so on .
But nothing is real . They realize that no cup is on table , no one is at room , and the light is off .
Commonly , the dreamers say that they ;
- experience when they are so tired physically and so stressed .
- feel drowning down when they are about falling in sleep(so they know it will happen )
- feel a lot of press on body and can not move in dream .
- see someone or some people as standing beside or riding on them .
- feel the dream is so vivid and real .
- repeatedly dream again if they rarely awake themselves .
Some experience so easily and often .
Most scary case I heard is that the ghost pulled hair into under bed as stabbing chest with a sharp gimlet .
Luckily , I have never dreamed it .

Peter looked at his watch and knew that he has to do something immediatele .
He had forggoten to go to his English classes .
It was half past seven and her class begun fifteen minutes ago .
Last week her mother told her that he had to go to his classes if he wanted to hang out with his friends .
He already knew that he was late but he could not go now , so he decided to cheat her mother .
He did homework from his books so his mother might believe it .
But he did not realise something , His little brother was watching him througt the window .
When her mother came back from work , her little son told her what his brother had done .
She was very angry and she could not believe that her son did that .
After that Peter did not hang out for three months , so he can learn the lesson , You must not lie or cheat to your mother .
I think that the public transport always going to be so important in our life because not all the people have the possibility to buy a car because the public transport is more expensive than a car , so for that reason the public transport in the future could be exist , because public transport is a necesity in all the world not only for the money but too for the facility to take a bus or any other public transport
Yesterday I went to the Ulster Museum in Botanic Gardens at 2 pm .
I went to nature section , which is interesting as it is about natural aspects on earth like elements , rocks and periods of life related to organisms .
The section was big and it had a lot of information in a scientific manner , some section had complete information part while other had not .
Beginning in one of the complete parts that I preferred and liked I 'm going to write about the Ice age .
It was a period of time in earth 's history when temperatures fell globally , causing ice sheets and glaciers to form far from the north and south pole .
¿ What did you learn about debates ?
Mel , who was a teacher for young people .

How be a good debaters .
He uses a rule for debates : preposition+ result = positive or negative ( Why )

Debates is a combat
Peter has just got out by school and he realized that he 's overdue for his weekly guitar lesson .
But before the lesson , he has to lunch with his family and leading the dog from the veterinary for his annual vaccine .
Peter gets a fast lunch in ten minutes , other two minutes for finding the bike and putting the dog on the basket ; at the office of the veterinary three people wait , so Peter is forced to wait .
After an hour the dog is vaccined and taken at home , but her mother needs a milk bottle .
Unfortunately Anne , her sister , has just taken the bike , so he 's forced to walk until the nearest supermarket .
Peter 's mother needs a special kind of milk without lactose , and the market behind home does n't have it .
So Peter had to make a choice : going at the lesson or waiting his father for getting to take the milk with the car ?
After an exhausting afternoon , Peter has a bit of luck , infact his father Jack has just came back from the work , so he could get to take the milk and giving him a passage .
With a little delay , but Peter did it !

An excessive amount of cars on the road is not an option as this could cause problems in most metropolitan areas .
There would be a tremendous amount of pollution and traffic jams .
As the population grows , you will an increasing problem .
Thereore , public transportation is the future and more and more people will be using the metro , publis buses etc .
Cars are not good .
They have pollution .
But they go fast .
Cars are red .

Sport is the activity that help the people at have an optimal physical .
I think that sport is important for discipline in life .
My favourite sport is football , it is a complete sport , there are aggression , mentality and fun .
my favourite football club is Napoli , it is the heart club , for this team I feel indescribable emotions ... when I see my team , I smile in moments of joy , I cry in moments of sadness and suffering and rejoice when they score and win the game .
i advice at all people that want start sport of they do begin , because this sport helps to grow and mature .
work in your own company is very challenging because you deal with a lot of areas , manage all departments and learn about busines , management , economics , sales , engineering , tecnical support and other skills .
you are responsible for your workers and the customer satisfaccion , However is very satisfying to see how your own company is grow up and your customers return again because they loved your job .
that work looks depressing , demanding and stressful but is very rewarding and if you like the challenges you never will bored
Dear Friend
hope you are fine , kindly be know that I miss you so much and I hope to see you soon .
I 'm very happy to know that you want to come to Egypt and work in it .
Here are some tips about the Egyptian people
they are so kind , friendly , stressed but have a lot of problems now days the level of poverty , standard of level , the fixed cost is increasing dramatically and the purchasing power is decreasing .
The salary or the income in Egypt does not match with this increase or this inflation .
So if you want to work in Egypt you must have a complete information about the job ( location , salary , incentives , Allowances , work environment , position titles , company type , policy , mission , vision )

Military service is people who is forced by the government be a part of the army to serve and protect the country .
There are many countries which should be complete the military service when people who reach 18 such as Taiwan , South Korea and Singapore .
The duration of the military service should be around 12 mouths to 20 mouths .
Also , there are different sections of training during the military service people generally do a lot of training to their obedience or how to use the weapons .
Thus , there is a cause of agreement and another cause of disagreement which is freedom of choice and mental maturity .
As this topic , the one of the reason of everyone should not have to complete the military service because the freedom of choice .
Some people may think it seem to be a human rights that let the people to choose if they want to join the military .
Otherwise , when the people are forced by the government , they probably feel the freedom of choice is restricted .
So some counties would not force the people to join military .
In contrast , it could be the benefit that improves their mental maturity .
If people join the military service when they just 18 , it may learn a lot of life skills as there are quite a high claim in the military and the chancellor who work in the military may request to the soldiers that everything frequently be regular .
For instance , they usually need them to fold up a quilt in a specified angle or there is specific time that you must wake up and get sleep .
People should not be complaining about anything even if they seem to be right .
But after a period of time , people could develop their obedience especially to the young people ; they will be likely to become a more independent person .
To conclude with both sides , there are reasons to effect by people should or should not have to complete military service .
However ; the effects may different which is base on how length of the duration .
Hi mum and dad
Today I had a trip to a museum and an art gallery with my school .
The museum and the art gallery located in the capital city .
The museum is huge and beautiful .
I really like antiques even though it is not much to look at .
The art gallery is nice too .
They have some paintings of Leonardo da Vinci which is really impress me .
My favourite part is listened to a guide introduce to panting art .
I ca n't wait to back home and tell you more about the trip .
Love from your son :) .
Thanh .
In my city , we have not a regular care for the environment .
There have been many projects to improve the caring of the environment .
But there is a big problem : the people 's culture .
In my country you can do a lot of efforts to take care of the environment , but the bad culture in our people is a great problem .
That is because we do n't demonstrate interest in the problems of others .
We think that our authorities are responsible for these themes .
Then , we do n't take positive actions , individually .
We just wait until others clean the streets .
The people put their rubbish in bags and threw it away near their houses .
They do n't spend money in a good container .
Then , the dogs can break the bags and eat the rubbish .
In this way the streets are always dirty .
In my case , I prefer to have a clean Street .
It does n't matter if I lose time putting the bags with rubbish in a good container .
If everyone 's demonstrate a better culture , it is possible to improve our environment .
Nowadays we grow up with the possibility of choosing a lot of sports .
This fact allows young people do exercise and enjoy at the same time .
Do team sports also help to meet other people and make new friends .
Favorite sport of many people is football , instead of my favorite is basketball .
I started to play it when I was twuelve years old and currently I still love this sport .
My main reason for love it is how you feel when play a match and finally your team win .
Also , I known great friends who play basketball .
Every sport focus on some parts of the body , however basketball is the most complete sport .
It is true that basketball require a lot of physical activity , but a good mental attitude is very important .
You ca n't be disappointed because you do n't get any point or have a bad day , due to the other players can sympathise with you .
If it happen , you will continue doing the best as you can .
To reach this , I recommend do exercise three times a week and follow a healthy diet .
Adolescent has always been the hardest part throughout anybody 's whole life ..
turning out in a fleeting glimpse into an adult , perceiving the other side of life , how tough and complicated it is , trying to deal with its different circumstances ..
at this point you merely have a brief look at your whole life , many questions spinning in your head , accusing yourself of being a lost cause , wishing if you could turn the clock back,,but it 's all no good ..
then you find yourself standing ahead clouds of reality , which sucks ..
life is stages , this stage of your life is timeless , no way out ..
at some point you wish if it was all illusio , you need a time machine makes it possible to go back in time when you could see the purity of life ..
However .. here you are completely different made of life lessons , preferring to make a stiff upper lip .. cowering in your own reality .
Yes , television entertains , but it can also educate .
Television can improve knowledge on current affairs .
Education does n't lie on current affairs or related concepts .
Television helps us to find the fields that interests us , like music , sports , movies or nature .
These days television allows us to see happenings all around the world .
However , there are quite a lot of disadvantages of television .
Especially , the fake news spreads faster without much effort .
It depends on the individual , how to make use of the opportunity .
Watching TV seems to be top on our list of things to do after a long hard days ' work with a hot cup of tea in dark winters .
TV were and are seen as entertainment channels , but have you ever questioned if they are more then just entertainment ?
Are we subconsciously educating ourselves ?
You ask how ?
Now that would be an interesting question , we can watch anything from news to cat fish the TV show , in the name of entertainment are actually learning .
The truth is we are always learning , but how we learn is another matter , there main type of learners are auditory , visual , and kinesthetic .
TV stimulates at two learning style which is visual and auditory .
Some may argue that TV just does not have sufficient content for us to be able to learn , other may argue that TV is an amazing source of learning . i.e we learn about new technology via a mobile phone advert air on TV .
We learn about social values , World news etc .
I have personally picked up information I would not have come accross other wise for example , I have be able to learn that new BMW seven series , has ambiance lighting , it can pull in and out of the garage at the touch of a button , it 's computerises system can read different road surfaces and adapt it 's drive .
so have you ever asked yourself Television entertains , but can it also educate .
The New Music
Blues , Rock n Roll , folk music were the basis for the new music .
1966 - 1967 the huge change takes place .
The 3 musics were even known in 1963 .
Every music express other feelings .
There were some people who started playing Rock songs .
And after this everybody started to change there type of music .
Electronic was born .
It made everything possible .
Than the music hanged to multi media .
And so changed the old music to the new music .
The circuit is characterised by long straights and chicanes which makes it possible to achieve high - speeds .
Drivers drive the cars with full throttle for over 75% of the lap , longer than the other circuits .
In my opinion riding at high - speed on the long straight can be cause overheating the cars engines and the can blow up .
The rugged kerbs can cause the suspension crack .
The falling leaves can be block driver 's view and block up the radiators .
I think cutting trees which around the circuit and undercutting kerbs can be reduce danger and technical problem on the track and we have to reduce long straights .
Global power and politics are now surprisingly centered to those , which have an apex maturity of science .
Addiction to authoritative nature over other makes a huge production of war weapons convert the blessing nature of science into critics .
Despite all of the assistance of science in daily life , it has not without criticism in different views .
Science replaces human labor into instrument , but what about happiness ?
There is no definition of happiness in scientism or how could it get through the scientific user manual .
Very often , it has criticized to change indigenous cultures into so - called luxurious development , contradictory to religious faith .
Science is concerned only with the information about the world whatever it is , and sometimes in unethical conclusion without considering the morality .
It occupies so pivotal a role in modern society and commands so much public money , should find itself subject to criticism from a variety of source .
But living 21st centaury , its difficult to blame science where we are benefited through its technological applications on everyday our life to an ever - great extent .
My country is pretty clean compared to the cities and countries that I know although there are a few pieces of paper or plastic on the streets , but residents have a great respect for nature .
In fact , they keep the woods clean and the owners sent the loggers to remove dead trees now or those that could lead to hazards , but every time you remove a tree , is immediately put a young plant so that the environment does not undergo changes that will lead out balance the system .
For waste management across the country , even in the countryside , they were placed the bins for recycling paper , plastic , glass and waste .
Three times a week garbage trucks pass to empty them , and once a week a garbage collector passes to clean up the streets .
Travelling by using any transport has become in one of our needs , in the past people used to take hours waiting for the public transport , now , we can afford any of those modern car at the agency .
The future of the public transport is fading away , you might ask why .
the main problem is the bad service , for example , the drivers are not careful enough to drive , that might be unsafe for the users .
another disadvantage is the unclean chairs in the transport .
Those are the main reasons that could make the public transport diseappear .
I consider the best option to buy a car so we can feel safe .
Firstly , it is a good idea for young children do physical activity that is the first step to do exercise , then to compete sports will make competitior to make an extra effort .
Also , just for young children that are in process of growth and development , physical exercise is essential to do it , because they can have a healthier life .
Young children try to effort , and wants to win at this age , and if they train results were better and encourages to keep training .
In psychic way , if you are adapated forms relations and create new friends .
In the future , adults that was able to obtain more achievements and make it more responsible , and you can have a good social life , if you competes doing sports .
In addition , stress is a clear disadvantage of compete because competitiors are trying to win and this can frustrates .
But , some people do not think this like this and take it more simply
Finally , I think that to compete in sports has some benefits and disadvantages , but when is controlated there are some benefits that help you to whole you life .
Dear sir / Madam ,
For upcoming enhancement , I would like to inform you that there was no longer the public transportation services since travel by car more convenient .
Therefore travel by car is ready by now .
Best regards ,

Even though the shops is not large , there are remarkable goods , for example , nice running shoes or valuable books .
Possibility of the shops
All in all , the shops have a variety of goods , which can attract many tourists .
If you have a small kid , you will visit toy shops , which offer many cars and helicopters .
On the other hand , you can visit book shops whether you are pensioner and you have a lot of free time .

Hi my name is Chai , i 'm from Thailand , I try to write an article to improve my writing skill and hope this program can help me .
My favorite way to travel is the Plane because I like to be fast and in my life , I hate a wait in my opinion the plane is the best for me for example when you want to go somewhere you need to reach there so quick , you do n't need to take time and The plane is the best travelling in the world that the best safer than other way , you can see on the pollution of people who got an accident , how often an accident happen by the plane so anyway if it 's happen , i ca n't imagine it , Eventually I wish everyone who like to travel is safe and sound and safe journey .
First of all Television has less viewers now days .
Most of the people turn to the Internet website or applications like Netflix or Youtube .
Now let 's go back to those days when young people still watch television for entertainment .
There were a lot of programs on television .
Most of the people watched news , movies , or tv shows on television .
Also there was a lot of different channel that we chose .
As I remember there were educational channel like Discovery and National Geography .
Those channel always content a lot of new technology .
For some people may think that only these kind of channel can provide educational knowledge and for some people they do n't consider watching these channel as entertainment .
For these kinds of channel are both entertainment and educational .
But I wo n't opine that these are the only channels that can provide knowledge .
All kinds of shows can give you all kinds of different knowledge even when you watch movies .
But of course there will be some channel that is not suitable for child under 18 or just for adult .
As I think there is no channel that you ca n't learn form it .
All kinds of programs have something that you can think about just depend on how you look at it .
So television entertains , but can it also educate ?
Yes of course but only when you look at it as a way you wanna learn something .
My studies in tecnologico de Monterrey are demanding and challenging because it has a very high educative score all worldwide , but also has to many good things , for example we have a lot of interchanges all around the world , when you have the opportunity to do an interchange you have to deal with the language and the culture with the other country , that means you have to be responsible for studying the basics things of that country , but all of this is worthwhile because when you are there you have so much fun .
I think that a complete sport is to swim for most of the people .
It 's good for health and wellness .
I really enjoy because give me a lot of relax and it help me to be tonic and satisfied myself .
Usually I go three times a week and during the weekend .
I advice peolpe to start this sport , because is completely and make you mind with the body feel very good .
When I was fourteen years old , I win the championchip because in that period I swam as agonistic atlet .
It had been a really satisfation and I had been happy .
Nowadays I 'm really grateful to my parents because they have spent money for me and I have to thanks them .
I think this sport is the most completely compared to the other sports .
Your muscles begin more efficient and tonic and you have a lot of benefits for the body .

Subject : Our green town
Introduction
The aim of the report is to write how are town take care of the environment .
I do a research and this are findings .
Rubbish
We have a lot of bins around the area , so now we can throw our litters whenever we are .
Also we have recycle bins for paper and glass .
Cleaners
Every Saturday our local cleaning team clean the park and now everyone can enjoy it !
Conclusion
We do everything to make our town more green , our citizens always have new ideas that make the difference of our daily life .
It is common that more and more people get overweight , caused by too much fastfood and unhealthy lifestyle .
Now some scientists have suggest to having warnings on some types of food and drink .
But is this idea a way to reduce the bad habit of consume noxious foodstuff ?
On the one hand I ca n't imagine that a little scine on the food people entrap to stop their shopping and read the warnings .
Life is fast moving and time is money .
Everything has to happen fast .
First of all , we need to make people aware of the current environmental situation in order to do activities that help the environment .
To begin with , we have to try to use as little as possible the car or the bus and try to get at any place walking or by bicycle .
This action would decrease the gas emitted to the environment .
In addition , the water issue is another big problem .
Nowadays , people is wasting water instead of saving it .
One basic solution for this point is try to not take a shower for so much time but taking it with a bucket and a few minutes .
Another solution is to not waste water while we are washing dishes .
We should use another bucket for this task .
Talking about rubbish , it is very important to separate it in the following types : metal , plastic , organic , glass and cardboard in order to make the collection task easy for the dustman .
However , we also have to try to not create more rubbish recycling most of them .
For example , the organic rubbish can be used as fertilizer , the metal scrap can be taken to the melting factory as well as the glass .
Therefore , the environment is not going to recover if we do not decide to take our part in this global problem .

Public transport is and always will be very important for society .
As we 've seen these days that the amount of cars is increasing so much every year .
As a consequence of an increasing in number of private cars .
Governments around the world have talking a lot about the measures should be taken to improve public transport quality .
No doubts travelling by car is pretty much better than go by public bus .
although Louis felt nervous , she realised this was the opportunity of a lifetime .
I was manager at retail store .
Everyday work stressed me and by the end of my shift I get so tired .
I decided to go back to school .
The program I start at school was very tough for me , because my slow English writing .
I do not have very good english writing skill .
My grammar and spellings are week .
I am struggling in school .
I am trying my best hope I will pass my course and get a good job .

I 'm really sorry , you ca n't come over because my father is at the hospital for 14 days .
But in 3 weeks I 'm free .

Write to me soon , please .
Mireia
The future transport is the public , because the traffic it will be less .
When the people travel by car is for work , holidays or for other motive .
We should use the less car , it is very pollutant .
I will start with old transport , if we did n't make any maintenance this type will be damaged and lose it .
In the future , every person will use his car and no need for public transport.this type of transport have a path and just take you for specific places and you ca n't use it to go to small streets .
But in some country , You can use underground ( metro ) , it is very advanced than old types like Bus or Taxi , The underground is faster and clean and arranged .
About pollution , it is a big issue in public transport , with time if you try to fix the machine of public transport that will be coste , because with time the live age of this machine will finish .

Michael though that it was time to do something .
He could not be at home all day doing such nothing so he started to look for another job that would be suitable for him .

There are soccer lessons .I have joined the lesson .

My father is 73 years old , his name is Brahim .
He is tall and smart he looks like a movie star .
My father has many hobbies , he plays foot ball , reads newspaper and listens to Radio .
In my opinion , family is more important than friends , but probably I spent more time with my friends than family . I know if I need something my family is always there .
The difficult is that you rarely know if your best friend is a true friend .
Unfortunately , my best friend deceived me , I do n't know how she managed but she hurts me .
My cousins are very reliable like my grandmother and my parents .
The family has a link blood therefore you have a natural empathy .
For all rules have exceptions .
I do n't trust in some members of my family and I have friends like brothers .
You need to discovered who is your best friends . Lifelong you will learn who is who .
For me , my best friends are in my family , except one .
She
grown up with me and now she is my sister too .
My city is Jaén it 's in the east of Andalucia and is an important cross ways between the south and center os Spain .
So an important historical place is the St. Katherine 's castle .
This is an old castle of 10th century and the style is Arabian .
It 's over a high hill with difficult slopes to arrive because the most important property is it impregnable .
In the reconquest age the stronghold never downfall with a direct assault , finally the Castellan 's army after a large siege force to the government surrender it .
Then in the 18th century the Napoleonic army lived in it until the end of independence Spanish war .
The French army before came back to France destroyed it .
Actually the castle has been restored and has a historic museum , also have a great hotel with four stars for tourists .
I like this place because I can enjoy a good views to my city .
I prepare class every day .
I try to do all the activities in class .
I do n't have enough time to practise and do activities at home .
I need to speak and participate more in class .
We speak most of the time , so it is good to develop our confidence and fluency to converse .
plane , train , and boat are the ways to travel .
I think the boat is the best way to travel and I have three reasons for my idea .
First of all , boat moves across the sea and the sea is very beautiful .
For instance , when we move on the sea , we can see many types of animals , such as birds , turtles , and fishes .
Next , the boat usually is very big , so we can do many activities on it , such as dancing , drinking .
Finally , It is the safest way for travel , because we do not have many dangers , such as crashing , falling any other kinds of danger in the sea .
Therefore , I prefer the boat to travel , instead of the train or the plane .
All in all , travel in the sea with a boat can be very interesting and comfortable , in addition , it is very safety .
I advise you to travel by boat if you have enough money for it .
Have you ever practised rafting?Do you know how amazing is to do this cool sport?If you do n't know nothing about it , it 's high time to do it !
I had n't never heard about doing rafting until my best friend , Carmen , told me whether I wanted to have a whale of a time with her and I accepted it .
Therefore , we went to join in a sports centre which take over organising this stunning outdoor activity .
Rafting get you burn all your adrenaline whereas you try to get down over the river in a mini - boat .
It 's extremely exciting !
In addition , you 'll enjoy a breathtaking landscapes around you and you 'll also see a vast range of wildlife in both sides of the river .
Nevertheless , I would recommend you to wear appropriate clothes and to bring protection cream with you .
In contrast , you could suffer some nasty cuts or , even though , being sunburnst .
Let 's go !
Do not hesitate taking up rafting !
You wo n't regret !
My life now
In my life I have had a big experiences that have made me change and mature .
One of the most important experience I think was coming to study to Tijuana .
It was a really challenge for me to live alone .
Before I came here I was so dependent of my parents and I had a lot of fear , but I learned to overcome all the things that stopped me .
When I was child I used to live in Tijuana .
I was born here .
When I had 4 years I went to live to Ensenada because my father worked there .
I was used to living with my whole family in Ensenada .
Since I was born to my 18 years old I was living whit them , but now I live in a small apartment .
I am studying Nutrition at the University , that is why I am living in Tijuana .
I used to live in assistent house it was my first place where I lived in Tijuana , then I changed to an aparment with two friends .
All weekends I used going to Ensenada for visiting my family , my boyfriend and my fiends .
Before I came to live to Tijuana , I was really nervous because I had to leave everything and because it would be a change in my life .
For summit , came to live to Tijuana was a really challenged for me .
I learned that you need to face your fears , to achieve your goals .
I do not regret what I did because I do what I like .
Now I am so independent and I learned how to live alone .
I live in a small village on countryside with few people .
Even if we are a country , we take care of the environment through the use of photovoltaic systems on roofs of many houses , such as the nursery school and other houses that have this systems to produce energy .
We separated paper from glass and also to plastic .
The garbage picks up paper once a week , plastic two times at month and undiferretiated three times a week to all people who live in my country .
My district makes clean my village and it usually tries to make attractive with new social initiatives for the community .
All people of the world have friends , I 'm not an exception .
When I was 10 years old I met my best friend .
We 're friends since we start to talk , but our friendship has change over the time .
When we were 12 we played in the garden with the balls and with the other boys and girls , but when we were 12 years everything changes we do n't want to play in the garden because we preferred cinema or watching TV .
Because of age changing we did n't see us , but in the moment that we grew up more , we met us the weekends and sometimes we 're upset about some problems that we had .
With the time we are more friends .
Now , we discuss sometimes but we love us because he always stay together in the good moments to take a coffee or talk about our lives , but he also stay in the bad moments , despite being friends since we were 10 years old .
For this reason I think that friendship is so important thing in the life .
I think the opposite , I believe that public transportation has a really huge future .
It is true that we are a lot of users that want to use the car but , and that amount is growing up ; as well there are a lot of people that do n't have the posibility to have a car and some use the public transportation because many reasons like the price , because it is easier to get to the place by public transportation rather than car , because the traffic , some times for people it is so exhausting to drive lots of hours an even some times the public transportation is faster .
The population is growing up so fast , we need public transportation , is important .
Public Transportation is convenient for some people and some people think is more convenient the car , finally we will need public transportation on the future .
In our opinion globalization is a good thing that happen to us , allow us to interact with all the world , so we can meet the cultures , monuments , etc .
It bring us a lot of opportunities to change and in some cases to get a better life in other countries like find a job with the highest salary .
Although we need to change some things in the world , more than these is to change a lot of things in the third world countries , because it is not acceptable that in the twenty - first century a person live with less than a dollar per day .
Dear Molly ,

First at all , this is a report that will explain how the village of Vancouver is handle their rubbish material .

Finally , every city hall is improving the care of the environment because there is an incentive programmes from the goverment like if they cut the spends of every house by 50 % city halls get more money from the central government .
I strongly believe that grammar is not the most important element to speak English , if you know grammar you only know certain rules to write , but I think that speaking is most important than writing , because when you go to anyplace in the world , you have to be prepared to talk and understand whatever they say to you ; in this part you may notice that if you do n't know vocabulary , you would n't unsderstand anything ; but here is another topic , whether you understand or not , you have to notice the way that people talk to you , and try to realize what the person is trying to say .
According to your e - mail , we discovered the price should be USD 122 instead of 222 .
Please be advised that the right amount on the settlement date .
Awaiting for your amendment as soon as possible .
Ride bicycle is my favourite sport .
It helps me healthy .
It leep me positive mood .
I can seen much scenery in short times . I can buy goods along the road .
Buy a good bike is the first when you start to ride .
Once or twice on a week to ride .
It can Avoid catch cold .
It is clear that technology has provided us with several options in communication .
Perhaps the clearest example of this is that unlike the past , it is not necessary to buy envelops and stamps to send the letter .
Instead , people prefer to email or text to send messages .
Another way this change is evident is that social networking or applications such as Skype , FaceTime and Facebook are widely used to stay in touch with their family , friends and relatives
My favourite sport is basketball .
This sport is very easy to play .
You need to play it on team .
You need to have ability to play it .
This sport is about you catch the ball and score .
You do exercise to be strong and have ability in your legs and your hands .
I enojoy this because I like it .
I love this sport .
In some cases you could have an accidents , but that 's not probably .
When I 'm playing this sport I have a great moments and I learn more and I will have more experience in a future .
It does n't difficult and you can start to play .
All the people can do this sport .
Basketball is recognize to people in the world .

The members of my family are my best friends .
Because we spend a lot of time together .
And there is a good communication between us .
In my opinion , every family must have a good communication . Because I think , communication is one of the most important things in our life .
We use communication every time .
Because people have to use many communication techniques to communicate with other people .
However , the families that haven't a good communication haven't a good life .
If we want to have a good life , we must make good communication in our families
Hi !
My name is Anton .
I live in the one of the most beautiful countries - Ukrane .
When I was at school my friends and I attended unior swimming school .
I was 30 years before .
I used to have training twice a week .
I liked that time a lot .
My friend and I always had ice creame and fun after training .
Now I 'm a business analyst .
I work at office and have no ideas where are my friends .
This year I decided to star visiting pool and swim up to three times a week .
Now , when I swim at the open pool , I am overfilled by positive emotions .
I like swimming a lot .
Nowadays the obtion of broaden the ming traveling is very commun .
In my opinion I think that it is not the only way but it is the best way .
Apart from that you see new places and you have fun , you also lern others cultures , historicals facts , you also lern to respect others peoples and thirs costums .
In addition you do n't think in yours problems and the only thnig that you do is have fun and do what you whant to do .
Besides you see new world and thirs form of lives and that helps to open you mind , see the world in other way .
In conclussion I think that it is the best way to opemn your mindn not the only way but yes the best way .
many countries are truly started to concern no environment and worried about the globe warming , In schools teachers are doing their best to educate children how to take care of their schools and keep them tidy , also they train them how to plant trees in public gardens of their towns ,
Although government strict so many laws and taxes in the people how do not pay their taxes to the council for cleaning of the rubbish from towns and villages , in the biggest polluted city in the world people started to use bicycles and cycling instead of driving their cars to reduce the pollution of their city , also they invented different ways to plant even every little area which can be planted to keep their city clean and attractive .
First of all , I disagree with that statement , because of these reasons I am about to give .
Once we stop using Public transport , it is going to causes problems .
For example , if we completely relaying to use cars it is going to increase the gasoline uses .
Apparently it is going to make more pollution more global warming issue .
How ever , using cars makes the life easier but when everyone or every house they will own at least three cars it is too much .
Although the traffic jams the accidents etc .. .
public transport it is really important and it has a lot of advantages for helping humanity .
In my opinion every country they should have different kind of public transport
buses , subways , and trains .
For instance San Francisco it is a great example for incredible city , the variety of choices in the public transport it is remarkable .
In spite of the cost of these facilities it is going be expensive but it is necessary .
In conclusion , The governments should work on that because the people need the public transport and the world for the environment , life expanses it is much cheaper than having a car .
I hope to see it around the world , public trans port something we can not avoid or replace with another thing .
In the future , public transport will disappear .
Everyone will have his own car .
Cars will be safer and speeder than now .
Traveling by car will be the best suitable
way to move from place to another .
Recommend to friends what country we have to go .
I would like to recoomand friends to visit Italy .
first of all , nowadays wherever we go we can find Italian restaurant easily .
There are a lot of food all over the world .
but I think Italian restaurant is getting famous .
Second , beautiful tourist places like a Venice .
I have been to Italy when I was 20 .
It was awesome .
There is no word to explain .
Venice is city that is based on water .
There are no car , no metro in Venice .
On the other hand it could be complicated . but nobody complaint .
I think that 's why this city can maintain the safe environment .
Third , Italy is famous for fashion .
It brings many fashionable people .
if you are person who love fashion you will enjoy going there .
The last thing is history .
This country has a lot of history .
so it makes me exciting .
so if you want to visit any country i 'm going to recoomend to Italy .
The biggest anecdote , that I have with my friend , was our trip to Disney world .
Where we could visit all the parks of Disney , like Animal Kingdom , Hollywood studios and Magic kingdom .
In adittion we could visit others parks , like Universal and Bush Garden .
But this is not the end of our trip , we went on a voyage in a Royal Caribean cruise , where all the food and drink was free , because it was also paid .
During the voyage , we disembarked in the Bahamas and CoCo kay , which is a private island of the cruise , we went to the beach and played so many games .
To sum up , this trip was the best experience we have in our lives , because we make friends , visit a new country and we have a lot of fun .

Dear Sir ,
I 'm writing on behalf of Mrs Renata Barczak .
30th October works for Renata to meet in Berlin .
I checked connection between Warsaw and Berlin and she might be at 11.10 at Berlin Ostbf station .
Is it possible to arrange a meeting near this station ?
I think in future is n't necessary to use the public transport and why ?
Simple , the new generation decided do take your driving licence and I saw this around me , my colleagues , my friends , my family .
It 's just a question of time when everybody will have a car .
This afirmation : travelling by car is so much more convenient say everything , for example if we think a lot of time we spent on wait bus to arrive our destiny , the traffic is a lot of things that everyone prefer buy car it more practical and fast .
Do n't forget the cust .
In my opinion the price of the ticket on bus is expensive .
Every year the price of public transport turn it up .
We can stop and do a mental arithmetic and we can see a lot of many we spend one year .
If we have a car I believe we do n't spend much money .
It 's just my opinion because this is my life so I now what I am talking about .
Every months a buy my pass for use on the bus .
I am part of the new generation where in future use car and the public transport are disappear .
Hi Isabel ,
How are you ?
Where are you from ?
I 'm from Italy , I live in Varese a beautiful town not far from Milan in Lombardia .
Varese has many attractions between which the lake , where I like to stay .
My favourite place in the town is Estensi gardens , where I go to walk with my friends during the afternoon .
Michael is a nice boy but one day he met Julia .
Julia is a pretty girl .
They spent time together and were very happy .
But Michael sometimes has problem .
He is proud , it 's not a good way .
On Saturday they fighted and Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
public transport is important for anyone .
The people should walk more than before .
That makes them healthy .
Nowadays , many accident happened when they were driving their car .
They are going to travel around all over the world by plane .
the young people feel happy more .
In the argument , the author asserted that the city should prohibit skateboarding in Central Plaza .
The author claimed that the business dropping causes by the increasing number of skateboarded users .
Likewise , the skateboarded users brought numerous garbage that affects the stores in the plaza .
Based on author 's two concern , the statement that drew a conclusion to prohibit skateboarding in Central Plaza is not a thoughtful and wise decision .
First of all , it is a contradiction in the argument .
If more skateboarded users are willing to go to Central Plaza , there are more customers to help the growth of business .
It is against author 's assertion .
From this point view , the decreasing of business should cause by other factors , but not skateboarded users .
However , there are many reasons can cause the business dropping .
Probably , the stores are too old in Central Plaza which could not attract customers walk into , and have to renovate .
Furthermore , the produce sales in the stores that could n't fit customers ' need .
Those above reasons could influence the business in Central Plaza directly .
Second , author claimed that the sanitation problem caused by skateboarded users is not only happen by specific person , whenever more customers should bring more waste and wrongdoing .
Those problems appeal that there are not sufficient securities in Central Plaza .
Moreover , the problem would case by skateboarding immediately is the skateboarded users take over pedestrian walking space .
To solve this problem , the city should set up more space and facilities for skateboarding , and divide the different space for walking and skateboarding .
To sum it up , the author 's prediction wo n't happen if the city prohibits skateboarding .
In contact author 's concerns , the increasing skateboarded users would bring more potential to improve the business in Central Plaza .
On the other hand , the author should provide profound discussion why people come to Central Plaza do n't shop there .
The condition of the stores and safety are two crucial factors to affect the business in the plaza .
To strengthen author 's conclusion , the author should put the factors above in the argument .
I have big family consists of three sisters and one brother .
but when comparing my family with my father 's family .
I do n't feel that . because he has five sisters and three brother .
when my sisters are married they have one or tow children at most .I think the Egyption family became simller with the passage of time
The cocaine it 's the most dangerous addiction .
Firstly , cocaine damage your senses and your mind , if you consume cocaine , you wo n't sleep this day .
Secondly , it 's so addictive , because the body need more and more , so if you consumed cocaine , you would leave because you 'll an addict .
Finally , the consecuense of cocaine are the dead , if you sniff all the time cocaine or a lot , you die early .
In conclusion , cocaine it 's the most dangerous addiction , because you die early and your body it 's destroyed with the cocaine .
Oh , cool ! I haven't watched BH6 yet u.u

There is an increasing trend of personal transport so that public transport will be reduced in the future .
ultimately public transport would be negligible in future .
there are so many reasons that could be affected to public transport system .
the main one is , nowadays people are dead busy with their day to day life so that they do n't like to spend their valuable time for waiting on the way for the regular transport . also public transport is experienced lots of pollution which is harmful for human being .
for example , lunch time travelling is very dangerous for pregnant women due to emission of carbon mono oxide which is effected to red blood cells and irritate to breathing system . as a result , they prefer personal transport system for prevent from such hazards .
finally public transport system is not safe as always .
to illustrate , If teenage girls travel by public transport every day who will interact with society beyond the limitation.so it is a big challenge to them .
To who ever it goes ,
I am writing this e - mail because we want to hire your company to do the accounting of our company .

I am expecting your answer .

The graph shows the seasonal sales of ice - cream in two places - one is from an ice - cream while the other is in an indoor public swimming pool , from 2012 to 2014 .
The line which represent the indoor swimming pool remain fairly steady , from approximately 1800 to 2500,the period of every year from April to June and October to December own the highest outstanding achievement , whilst the sale is downwards overall .
However , compared to the line of indoor swimming pool , the difference of seasonal achievement of ice cream van is considerably large .
Overall , the achievement of ice cream van is better than the indoor swimming pool , from about 1100 to 5500 .
The best season to sale the ice cream from the van is autumn , while that is one of the worst season for indoor swimming pool .
The discrepancy of these two place is large .
The best sale achievement of the van is 4500,5000,5500respectively .
One day many years ago in something place that a do n't remember the name I woke up one morning more earlier than usual then I went to the kitchen and shout the name of my mother ... but no one answered , and the first thing that I imagine is that they come to the town , quickly I went out to find they ...
But there was no one , absolutely no one , I 'm scary , I yell and scream , look and look but I had no result
Suddenly I felt a warm hand that touched my shoulder and very slowly turn but the only thing I saw was a shadow that was holding a knife
I woke up and realised it had all been a bad dream
Recently when I was in youtube I saw a movie trailer , the film appeared so good and days later my friends told me if I wanted to go them to the cinema , so I decided to go and luckily they had decided to see the film that days before I had seen .
The film is a romantic movie , It is talking about one man , Noa , who lives in a small shore town when he felt in love with a rich girl , but like always the girl 's parents did not like Noa 's life because the girl 's father thinks that Noa is not enough good for their daughter .
And at the end of the summer the girl went out but next year she comes again , but this time she has boyfriend and this break Noa 's heart .
What Noa does not knows is that she was in love with him since the first time that she saw him .
The first of all I should say that I like a lot of kinds of sports .

With the rising prices for the public transport in London , commuters are choosing using their cars more and more .
Public transport was create to release the traffic in big town centres and also to facilitate workers commute .
Nowadays trains and buses are usually packed and the ticket fares are very expensive .
I particularly decided to drive to do my day to day tasks such as , shopping , visiting friends , church and so on .
To whom may it concern :
I came upon your ad on the newspaper and I wish to apply for the job .
I 'm a great people person and have a great knowledge on computers , organising activities for children and also I 'm a Jr. chef .
I hope you can grant me the opportunity to have a meeting .
Sincerely yours .

Hi my name is Robert .
My favourite sport is basketball .
I really like this sport .
I was 7 years old when I played first time .
My first match was when I have been in school .
Our team won this match .
We were happy with this .
My advice for someone who want to play this game , you do n't have to be tall or fast , when you play you have to think a lot .
I enjoy this game because the most important thing is team work , you have to understand each other .
It 's really important to be tall because you will score point faster and better .
My favourite player is Marcin Gortat .
He is Polish basketball player .
He is really tall hi have 202 centimeters .
My story with basketball were very short .
I ca n't give you to many advice but one thing I know , a team work the most important thing in this game .
To begin , all is very difficult here .
First place , my country 's politics is bad , and people have not work .
In second place , there are very important people , and they want to have a lot of money .
Young people want to find a good job here , but they are working in mc donal 's or burguer king for a low salary .
If you want to work here , you must know languages , for example : English , French or German .
You must be a person in charge and worker , and you be able to find a good work .
My family have a company , and if you want , you going to work with them .
I wish as lot of luck you , here .
If you have problems , you can call me ! !
I wait for your call .
Television is an essential part in our life , we turn it on nearly everyday , since it can make life more interseting .
Television entertains us , it can also educate .
There are two pionts to approve it .
For one , the show played on television may enlight us and give us some enlightenment .
Teleplay are not just for fun , it can have a deep meaning , short story tells big deal , just like a useful book .
So , why not television can not educate us ?
For another , there are many different types of programs , which can broaden our eyes , they give details of education , plus other meaningful information , such as documentaries , talk show and so on .
These programs are not just for killing the time , but for educating .
Television is just like a kaleidoscope , there are various materials provided for us .
To sum up , television entertains , it ca also educate .
Syria has a lot of good restaurants .
The Damascus restaurant at the centre of the city is quite a nice place to have a meal .
It has all kinds of food even the really fancy ones .
You can enjoy having your breakfast there with your family because they have too many types of food .
This restaurant also has games for children which they can spend their time playing it .
It also includes a huge parking so you can park your own car freely .
At Friday they serve special food for those who do n't have enough money to pay .
It 's a very nice restaurant which I prefer the most
Invention of car has made people 's lives easier .
No more they have to solely depend on public transport .
Though public transport are cheaper and one could get to know many companions , increase network .
But public transport has fixed schedule and on a rushing day not many can really enjoy their journey .
Public transport ca n't help when one has to travel suddenly or to go somewhere where it does n't pass through .
Those times car is convenient to use .
Ever increasing crowd in cities and thereby traffic problems are increasing .
The home of the future .
In present times the houses is very different , but in the future houses will be
perhaps the same .
The future houses will be different not from architecture , but the functionality .
Different people will be needed different functions , options and functionality of the future house .
This will be like in ancient times , but in the past the houses was the same all round .
Progress of the technique is very fast .
From : horses , steam vehicle , first petrol and gas car to future cars when the drive will be electricty .
The last film I saw was " The Enormous Island " so I am going to review it for the students film club .

This Saturday I start a new book by Francine River , the book could The Warior I haven't finish the first chapter but I find the book very good .

The public transport in the near future
Nowadays there are many ways to public transportation such as underground , buses , and etc . but is a reality that the people prefer to move by car .
Currently traveling by car is useful than public that transport , you can move around the city and reduce enough time sometimes you can share your car with friends or family and this way of transportation will be cheaper .
Teacher , I know to travel by car is the most convenient .
However , I think your mind is similar to what forebear thought , because for them , society are never going to get the transport we have nowadays .
It is difficult for us to imagine a world in which there are not cars like we are used to see .
Nevertheless , I trust in that technologies can suffer a progress in the future .
Moreover , we have still a lot of things which we can and must improve like travelling security , comfort and economic sources .
On the other hand , we should know that every means of transportation can be changed by 50 years later .
Maybe , we could find with flying cars or electric bikes .
For all that , I think that we should be prudent when we assess means of transportation .
According to Wordsworth a poet is not a common man , he has a greater sensibility and knowledge .
The power of imagination makes him become a teacher : he has to show men how to understand their feelings and the nature that surround them .
The poet is seen as a prophet , he has to improve people 's moral life and drive them to the truth .
He is the only one who can produce poetry in a simple language , thanks to imagination and memory .
I live in a big city and I have the opportunity to see a lot of tourists during the year .
Sometimes I give some information about where the name of streets or where the main monuments are .
I have any particular problem to help them , but I have often some doubt to suggest the place to go for a shopping .
The reason is that in my city there are a lot of shopping facilities good for tourists .
An example could be to have a free entrance in the Campidoglio museum if you buy a local newspaper .
Also , there are some well - known brand ready to give a special prize if you but a souvenir after 8 pm .
As you see there are a lot of opportunities for the tourists to spend their own money in my city .
You have only choose what is the best for you .
You will not regret .

Football is my favourite sport and I enjoy it because it is an aggressive game and fun .
The game starts with a ball at the centre of the field and them one of the two teams kicks it .
The goal is to get the ball inside the opponents net with your foot only .

wasting time is a huge issue in our life . a lot of knowledges related to time such as : history , education and healthy .
We discuss special topic about how we come faster than a time.this famous quote explains my previous idea " time is a sword if you did not cut it , it will cut you " .
Many people do n't care about wasting their time even when they busy .
Actually , in my life I consider it as a king of my system who controls whole of my day .
there is some people treat time As something of my own , they have the right to wast it and the right to look after it .
In the oposit side , some people let the time control their life .
However we should be balance from the both types .
she wasted it she can not get it back .
There is a time to love and a time to hate .
Also , there is a time to break down and a time to build up .
Imagine how you will live if you do n't have knowledge called ' time ' .
I will tell you my negative attitude about time before I take a lesson from my brother .
I did not care to time I usually said this is my life and my time .
But this is change after my brother arranges with me to organize our time .
He will leave me at home or pay for him two riyals for every minute if I late to him .
When I ask him to get me someplace . I can not count how many times I stay at home because I am late .
On time , penictual
I think that there is future for public transport , because there are still exist people who can not afford to buy a car , even travelling by car is much more convenient .
We have to consider people need to earn sufficient money to support their families and be able to buy a car .

my favourite sport is football , I like it so much it means for me a lot , It means partnership , teamwork , entertainment , exercise .
the whole world get together to support there favourite teams & the boys played it in the streets together .
I enjoyed it when I watch it on TV or when I attend it in the stade & supporte my team by my flag & supported phrases .
I advise any one dream to be one of the most famous teams that works on hisself a lot & and play football a lot to be profectional in this sport & show a lot of matches & followed by captain supervised on him
This issue is not clear - cut on both money and job satisfaction are important in deciding career in our life .
I think that on balance it is more important to try to get satisfaction .
First , happiness comes from inside our mind .
We work eight hours a day so if we submerge in a bloody pond in a long time could definitely turn ourselves frustrated .
I would choose a job with satisfaction .
In my own case , I am working as a co - cook in a diner .
Cooking has been my favorite in my life .
Costumers ' satisfaction brings me happiness .
Although the heat in the kitchen could burn us , the smile on the customers gives the best courage .
Also , the satisfaction from the customers pushes me to work harder and be better on my job .
Job satisfaction could make us to purchase perfection .
The more I can perform the much I can gain .
As a result , job satisfaction is a good way to get better paid .
I believe I could someday become a chef in my own restaurant and serve my customer a fabulous dish .
On the whole , therefore , I feel that it is best to go for a career that we will enjoy if this is possible .
Dear Paul ,
What 's up ?

I will talk about passion in a life .
passion is the best thing you have to achieve your goals .
passion is something makes you happy in your life .
when you have desire to do something , somehing you always dream to achieve it , something is touch you inside when not only do it but also when think about .
you should calm down and be away from the fast lifestyle and decide to do something or apply for a job which makes you great man , and then you will find your passion
The Home of the Future .
At the moment we have a nice house with the garden .
But what will be in the future ?
Possible we will in a space or underground .
In the future everything can change .
It can be painted with new colour .
It can be with the flowers .
But I think that not many change .
Probably houses will be smaller or bigger .
They do not look like big white ball .
Variety of negative impacts appears under rapid urbanization .
Urban flood is one of them .
Not only the growing impervious surfaces , but also the " false " green infrastructure contributes to it .
Mountains of studies demonstrated that green infrastructure is an economical , beautiful and effective strategy to control storm water .
However , urban flood keeps raging even when the amount of green infrastructure full fills the storm water control needs in some areas .
What is the obstacle that stopped these green infrastructures from providing the ecosystem service of mitigating and eliminating urban flood ?
each of person has a favourite sport and so do i.i really like soccer because it is exciting , i can learn many thing when i play it .
As you know that , soccer is a sport which has many people in a group , so it requires us unite and assistance together .
most of girl does nt like this , i think that it takes us energy , we need to do exercise , reasonable diet ... and so on .
i hope that you will try on it someday and realize it is correct
Our Mistakes mistake made us better than before if in life we had't got any mistake we would n't succeed that 's why the mistakes are very important in life and I believe our mistake improve us so
but in another way there just one mistake and you could not come back or arranged your mistake
This article is about how I think about the efficiency of public transport .
As I lived more than 12 years on the countryside I was dependent on busses and trains .
In the morning , I needed to get to school and in the evenings public transport helped me to get home .
I hold the opinion that a more frequent and more regular transport is needed .
Spontaneous activities were impossible as you always had to plan to advance .
I was hardly waiting for my 18th birthday .
I do agree television advertising direct toward young children should not bet allowed for several reasons .
First , this kind of advertisement should be forbiden reasoning the fact young children are still strongly vulnerable .
Kids around these age ( 2 to 5 years old ) do not have a maturated critical sense and anything can easyly persuade them .
For instance , when I was three years old I used to be captivated for all the toys which were presented on tv commercials just because the way they were exposed .
One of them was " the ultimate max steel " which was about a hundred dollars .
Secondly , I am also opposed the allowance of this advertisement because the severely consequence it causes into the parents and child 's relationships .
It is common we see parents having issues with their kids in reason to this kind of commercial .
Many parents have an unhealthy relationship , or even a wrecked relationship , with their kids .
One example is what happened with / to my cousin Patricia when she had her first child called Sophia .
One day sophia got really excited with an advertisement about barbie doll and she could not think about anything else than having this toy .
Unfortunately , my cousin did not have enough money to buy it , but her daughter - a three years old kid- did not understand it and got angry with Patricia , do not speaking well with her for three weeks !
In conclusion , I am strongly favourable to this statement . Advertisement for young kids , not only until 5 but until 8 years old should be forbiden reasoning the kid 's vulnerability and the risk to their parents ' relationships with them .
In last case , if the advertisements were still exposed , It would be essential some educational politics come with them , valorizing and teaching kids on understanding their parents .
Dear Mrs Kate Ashby ,
I read your advertisement in my newspaper last week .
You have asked about a server in your cafe .
I think , it 's a great job for me .
I 'm very talented to work with people .
In my education at school , i learned to cook and to wait a table .
Also I can work long hours .
In another job before , I worked per day for 8 ours .
So I think , it 's no problem for me , to stay and run the whole day .
I made one week a internship in a restaurant in my village .
There I saw , how a venture like this work and you must not to show me the whole work again .
I 'm really interested in that job .
By the way I live near to the cafe , so I have a short duty stroke and come every time punctual .
Yours sincerely
Niklas Lakatos
Dear Mrs Kate Ashby ,

My town is very beautiful and I like it very much because it is not any dirty streets in it
The governor of my city seek to develop it and he said it will be the capital of delta actually after 30 years ago
the people in my town deal with rubbish by healthy method , the citizens collecting the rubbish and threw it in big boxes far away the city .
Tanta will be attractive city and it will be important tourism point in the future .
If you are looking for a movie to see , I recommend you " Nemo " , it 's the most beautiful Disney 's movie .
The story is about a couple of clownfish who are attacked by a shark , only the dad and one baby egg survived .
The baby name was nemo .
When Nemo grows up , he goes to his first school day , there he is going to be captured by a man .
The only thing they found was a pair of googles that said the direccion of the man .
Nemo 's father knowns a fish called Doris that wanted to helped him , they cross all the ocean to go to Nemo 's location to save him , while Nemo tries to survive in a dentist house .
They finally meet and get happy again with a lot of good friends .
I think you would love it .
With love , Santiago .
This question is awkward for me because I do not like sport .
When I was young I tried Badminton , Squash and Teakwondo .
I do n't do sport now ,
I try to keep fit , and I walk one hour every day .
It is a fact that pollution is the one of the biggest concernment of advanced world .
The reason can be attributed to increased consumeristic nature and unware about waste management .
In the following paragraphs , am going to analyze these issuses in a detailed way to provide solution .
Dear Tom
I 've fully understand why is so difficult finding which activity is more important for You .
I think I would have the same perpelxity .
However sometimes we need to sacrifice something when we do n't have enough time for everything .
As you know I am a person who likes sport and music , but if I have to decide which of those activity are more important then I would prefer sport .
I think the physical activity can give us more profit in our life .
For example if You are active every day , you can keep your health in good condition .
Sport activity also make us feel more flexible and ready to force every day .
In conclusion I think you should give up your music classes .
Regards

Truly , there is no future for public transport .
Nowadays cars are more affordable than ever .
Almost every single household has more than one car .
With the development of the technologies , people will use other means of transport .
Having in mind that the society is also changing , people will tend to choose their place of work , which is near their home and wo n't need to spend time travelling .
We are witnessing a great development of the work from home these days , which will also lead to fewer people using public transport .
Three Suggestions to be Doctor
Do want to be doctor?.Many people around the world want to help people , so they choose to study medical .
If you want to be a doctor , you should do this three things .
First , you have to study hard every single day at the high school .
When study hard at the high school you will be
By looking at current situation of people 's lives , we can imagine the changes that can occur in future .
People are not interested in physical exercise & healthy food instead they are very much interested in earning money .
With no physical exercise & Healthy food people are damaging their health and family relations .
Now a days nobody has enough time to spend with family , Rather they prefer to make more money by working extra hours
If people live the same way as now , in future people will be considered as working robots instead of human beings .
When I was a junior high school student , I enjoyed playing basketball with my classmates .
For some reasons , I really liked to play basketball , first , playing basketball can train my muscle and make the body more healthier ; the second , my classmates and I all know how to win a game through the basketball game because the basketball game is a teamwork .
If you play the basketball and enjoy the game , you just go to the basketball gym with a basketball , trying to throw the ball into the basket again and again .
Do n't forget to play with your friends .
Three paradigms result from the attempt to characterizing epistemologically Spanish tourism research through the study of the AECIT Conference proceedings .
They are distinguished mainly by the disciplines from which they come : marketing and management , economics and geography .
Not everyone has car , so public transport is needed for every country .
Public transport is helping people to get work on time and help to reduce pollution .
Also , for low income families , they could n't afford to buy new cars , then transposition will help them to survive .
Public transport is also reduce the daily traffic .
it helps people to keep track their schedule .

Hi Michael ,
How are you ? I just want to say hello .
Currently , I stand at Syntagma square in Athens and it 's tremendously hot weather ! The sun is literally burning ! I 'm going to have a meeting with other international volunteers here in an hour .
I am looking forward to it as a small kid ! :)
I had the pleasure to visit Hotel Sparta at Omonia square on my first day in Greece .
I spent last night in this hotel .
I watched a Greek TV show .

We can really confirm that there is no future for public transport , if so , we will have to drive a car instead of buying a ticket for public transport and go to office , city , home and so on using private transport , however we can also think that in the centre has no parking car or it is not enough for the whole private car , thereby , if we use a public transport , we can simplify our lives and spend less simply because we are able to save money and time .
A comparison between people who like to use a public transport and private transport shows that first one can save money and time but also they are in relax much more than people who use private transport .
Finally , I do n't think that private transport is much better than public transport .
I hope that those people who wrote this article can change their thought and can likely to write a very useful article .
i like volei because it was part of my life and of life of my mother , is my favorite sport , but i like over sports too , same i do n't play volei because I 'm bad , and my friends that know , do n't like of peoples bad of volei .
I'm watching they playing , they 're really very good , but when play over school , they 're very bad
In modern growing world , The basic needs of general public are increasing day by day and their expectations on quality of life took a new dimensions .
When we were in our childhood , we used to deal with public transport for going one place to another because that was only a cheaper option available .
But today , Things are getting change and technology marked a significant role in our life , Automobile segment increased its vertical and having a car becomes a need from luxory .
We can see nowadays , more and more people would prefer to use their own car instead of buses or taxis because they feel comfortable and mobile in it .
A car can help him to go anywhere and anytime in much less time as compared to public transport .
I believe , as soon as Automobile sector develop new technology in cars people will more keen to use their own vehicle instead or public transport .
There are many reasons responsible for a better understanding between parents and child .
The first reason is no other than generation gap .
What is more , parents always consider their child best .
Parents often compare child to others also plays a role in this case .
As far as I know how to better understanding between parent and child .
According to the present situation it is a pity that their relative influence happiness family .
Therefore it is an important that we should cerebrate this problem .
The sum up the above argument , we should take some measures and have positive attitude .
On the one hand , we may take a communication forum , it can share everyone 's cerebration .
On the other hand , we should stand in other point and think their reasons .
Only by talking your points with your parents can prove all the problem .
Furthermore talking with parents can provide argued with them .
All in all , if you were to do this , your parents will not blame for you .
the wellness depend on three important factors : sport , nutrition and sleep .
the factor that we talk about is sport .
the sport is very important for the health .
the sport increase our physical performance .
the are a lot type of sports but one of them is the most practice in the world : the football .
football is a simple sport , where the player must kick the ball in the opponent goal . in this sport , you improve principally the leg muscles but all your body move .
homever the football is so competitive .
all the states in the world have an own league .
the best three team in the national league can take part at champions league ( in Europe ) or Asian league ( in Asia ) and so on .
lately a lot of child wish to be a professional player and they practice this sport every time and everywhere to improve the techinique .
homewer a lot of him ca n't reach this scope for a lot of reasons : no money , the height ( all team require a tall player ) and so on .
the football is very funny and you can play it everywhere with someone .
the football is a sport that group and fun a lot of nation .
For us ( Mainque and Lucia ) computers does n't have to replace the humans . because they do n't have brain and ca n't feel anything .
Computers do things that humans could n't , or it 's very difficult or it take so much time .
Computers have to obey orders of humans .
Computers depend on humans for their existence .
And it is going to be for all the eternity .
Humans is the best ! ! ! !

" The Exorcist " , the film .
" The Exorcist " , is one of the most exciting and astonishing thriller that I have seen in my life .
Actor 's interpretativos are sublime , and they make you feel afraid all film .
Especial effects are amazing .
Even though is destacable the fidelity with the text of the novel .
On thing that I find interesting , is that this film is atemporal ; I mean that you can watch in any decade of your life , and ever seems a nowadays film .
This confirm " The Exorcist " is a great film .
Nowadays , with the development of society , a large number of forests and lands are replaced by blocks and transport networks .
This will cause three problems to we humans and animals .
First and foremost , it can make contaminations to the environment , which can affect our health
Through this comparison the author wants to mark that the pagan spring festival may look like celebration of christian beliefs , but it is not .
On Easter time the important thing is to consecrate Christian tradition on the contrary , the pagan spring festival does n't focous on consecration but rather on celebration
My town takes care of the environment because the people of my town try to plant how many trees and plants they can .
The people of my town try to plant plants in the centre or somewhere is too smoke , so they try to keep the air at recommended levels.on the morning a lot of people go on footto the work or to the school or ride a bike or they take the bus .
The people try to move the local factories out of country where is less air polluted , less smoke , less cars and more forests and plants .
travelling by is convenient but for mass poeple public transport is very important and much need .
no of all people could afford to make conveyenc by car .car is easy and cozy also but public transprt is fair is much affordable to all clasess of poeple
public transport means mainly pubic bus.people used to travell long disistance by publis bus .it is possible to carry large number of people of different places to carry in bus .

Why does culture differences sometimes cause a division of a country ?
Recently Scotland really has ' Hit the world ' for some of the Scotch have tried their best for the Scotland referendum .
Although I knew that there is some conflication between England and Scotland , but the vote has really shocked me .
However , just as I thought , more than 50 percent Scots voted ' no ! ' , so Scotland did n't separated from the United Kingdom .
Public transport is here to stay .
- This goes without saying cars are much more convenient than late trains , but I can not agree with the overall statement although I do abhor using public transport .
I have been travelling with both for yeras , and I reckon each and everyone ends up needing public transport one day or another .
I would be a tad oblivious thinking vehicle ownership is granted beforehand when younger .
As a grown - up now , I know full well how more affordable public transport is albeit less than before .

The connectivity derived from Internet provides the invaluable business tool for online banking .
It influenced the consumers behavior on banking services .

Compared with the past when we use horse for transportation .
Did the people have the same opinion that there is no future for transport , and we only can use horse ?
The reason for why we have such improvement is that the technology and innovation have changed our life .
Cars replaced the horse , and even plane have replaced the cars for long distance transportation .
So I think there will be future for public transportation , and this may because of the updated technologies .
My favourite sport is a football soccer because it is the most popular on the worl .
After school my friends and I go to a park to play soccer , we play for two hours .
when they were in the hospital because Fernanda foodbone , they gave her some chicken soup with a ladle , so she could drinker easily , she started feeling much better so they decided her mom and Daniela to leave Fernanda on their house so she could get some rest and so she could ate more chicken soup , because they want Fernanda to feel better .
Daniela 's mom and her returned to the park , to continued piking the trash from the grass .
Later they went to see a grotesque stroke , after Fernanda crying called Daniela 's mom because she also felt bad with the chicken soup , and she wanted to know in how much time they 'll returned to their house .
So Daniela 's mom and Daniela arrived at home at 11:00pm it was obscure and they would n't me able to see Fernanda , on that time the light turned off , and they try to put them on but the lights did n't turn on .
They slept , at the next morning they light turned on , and they saw Fernanda standing in front of them very tired of waiting them , so she get angry with them and went to her room and she did n't come out from her room .
Her mom tried to tell Fernanda that they arrived very late because they had a very perplexed problem , so her mom told her that they came out from the park at 9:00pm it was still late but not too late , so they were on the street and the police arrived because they police thought that she had a globe with wine , and her mother told the police that she does n't have alcohol or wine on her car , and they police did n't believed her and they took them to the police station so they could check his car , and about 10 minutes approximately they told her that she did n't have nothing so they , went from there to their house and it was late , so that 's the reason .
She had allude the police before that she did n't have anything on the car .
When Fernanda came out from her room , she started prying on her mom wallet if she did n't have anything about the police or something and she did n't have anything so she forgave her .
But Fernanda summoned up the courage to ask her if she was n't telling any lies to her , and her mom told her that she vow that is n't any lie .

If I told you that , Travelling with a car or by bus , which one you will pick .
a lot of people nowadays will take their own car , it 's easier and flexible .
But why public transport have no future to stand and keep going ? , that 's because of the people that changing their mind , they start like having their own way to travel , Privacy also an important reason , people need to have a private means of transportation .
that 's why there is no future for public transport

My favourite sport is football , the principal reason why I like it is because when I was younger , I played with my friends and we got together to play every day .
I remember those years and I would like that my children will practise it when they will be oldest , an interesting sport .
My favourite team in Spain is Real Madrid , the best team .
If I were football player , I would like played in this team , but I think that it is very difficult because , only the best players gets it .
Nowadays I like others sports to practise : tennis , Basketball , ... but I prefer playing football with my mates on weekends , and then we drink some beers in the pub to celebrate the victory or the defeat .
These moments are very special and I hope to be able to enjoy for many years .
Finally I recommend this sport for the child in order to get a healthy life , get together with their friends and forget for much time alcohol and drugs .
I love sports and I believe to practise it is the best to get a good life .
I am here to write about a composition about public transportation in Somalia specially the capital city Mogadishu where there is a little public transport comparing to our neighboring countries . there is a scarcity of public transport and there is one type and model which Van as well as very distracted roads which may cause collateral damage .
Sometimes passengers and drivers face risks and road blocks which usually happen when the Somali government leaders are travelling across the city and even abroad .
So having good infrastructure helps a lot and constant peace and the people of Somalia will not suffer any more .
Thanks .
Hello friends , you 're welcome to Puerto , here we have a lot of shops .
What would you like to buy ?
We have a commercial center very nice .
If you want you can buy a lot of things there .
1 . Is it possible to go without compression machine ?
Will we can to compress ducts manually ?
2 . I 've noticed that the machine cost is higher than it 's been anteriorly .
Please , send to us actual strip material price .
3 .
If we want to produce spiro ducts and other articles in future .
Do we have to buy one new special machine ?
As for as public Transport you can save fuel as well as pollution but it take more time to reach the destination .
while if you have your own conveyance you can save time and moreover it is safe .
the most important thing is there would be huge traffic on the roads and traffic movement will be very slow .
but keeping in view of environment we should prefer to use public transport

The last film I saw was not new , in fact it was " The Others "
The others is a film that is based on a family that lives in a house and in this where many strangers things happen .
The principal character is Grace that is the mother of her two children Nicholas and Anne .
The hudsband of Grace is called Charles .
In the film there were servants , they were Bertha Mills , Mr Tuttle and Lydia .
This film is about a family that lives in a very big house .
Charles has to go to the war and Grace and her sons stayed in that house but not they were not alone they were with Bertha Mills , Mr Tuttle and Lydia .
The problem is that the mother started to listen many wear sounds and her sons were not doing them , so who was the responsible .
Her sons have a problem they ca nt see the natural light and one they Grace got up because her children were shouting and crying so she went to their bedroom and the courtins was not there so she go to the other room and the courtins also were not there so she stars getting nervous and more nervous so she go and talk to the servants , so she got very angry and she told them go out of my house and they did not care so she pick up a gun and the old lady returned her keys .
Then many things happened , and then they discover that the ghost were not the servants .
Of course I recommend this movie , because it is very interesting and in some parts is funny too , and Nicole is the principal character so I love it !
In my opinion I do not agree with what journalists do , or to me if I were a movie star , a famous man who has done many performances I do not like every hour of the day to be pursued by journalists .
In addition , everyone wants to have a moment of privacy and because journalists papparazzi can not have a moment to relax , tutoring for children or dependent on what else you want to do it and you can not because journalists .
And another reason why I have so right in what I had to say in the ranks above you feel if you were in game then people are always these people and destroy families because they declare false Intrigue sometimes .
Sometimes abuse the right to be a journalist with all sorts of questions with no response or have a partial response to these famous people can say that journalists have a stressful job for some people .
And finally I would like to say yes are against these people , or still might change their style and everything would be ok !

Nowdays , the number of endangered species has increased .
Aactivist of animals rights claimed that the reason is the keeping animals in zoo .
But lot of peoples saying that , the zoo can protected endagered spices against illegal poachers .
So what should we do with that problem ?
To sum up , there are lot of cleary strong arguments for against keeping animals in zoo .
In my opinion people should bulid some kind of wildlife parks . This solution will allow
people to watch animals in their natural environment , and most importantly , will allow
animals to safely reproduce .
It 's really expensive sollution , but we must do that for
our next generations .

My town is called Assuit . the People here , have no knowledge about how to use their rubbish.people throw their rubbish everywhere . on the other hand , we haven't any kind of law , that can limit that action ; I mean rubbish throwing .
So if we still doing nothing new , out country will still unattractive .
Humans prefer luxurious life .
Public transport is a bit uncomfortable .
With the coming of cars , people are using public transport rarely .
Everyone prefer to have his / her own car.so the future of public transport is very dark .
This is an alarming issue that needs to be addressed at earliest .
Because if everyone uses his / her car pollution will increase and that will eventually affect every living being .

Why I enjoy my favouite sport ?
So I think my favorite sport is go walking through the nature .
I love it , when the temperatur is a little bit cold , but not too much .
I can relaxing , when i walk alone and hear the noise of the birds in the trees .
I live in a little village near a forest , so I can go everyday walking through it .
There are so much animals and when you are quite , you can see a deer or a fox .
And sometimes I take my camera with me , because I love photography and there are so much great motifs .
Rest ... aurant .
There 's nothing like eating !
We all agree on that , eating food is one of the best moments on our day , it 's like word stops for a few minutes in which you are just enjoying your food .
But there 's a differenc between eating a good meal , and eating by the way .
In this opportunity i 'm going to talk about different cool restaurants we could choose at the moment of going out as the close of classes .
Michael decided to open the door and back for her , he thought better the things he do not want to leave her again , he like her , he knows himself and he wants to know her , he have kept all his feelings for a long time .
Which was the reason ?
The reason is the next , three days ago , he was working when a girl of his job asked him whether he had girlfriend and he told , I had one , come on you know my ex - girlfriend then she only walked without tell nothing .
it was strange for Michael .
He remembered , two years ago when he had been working and he decided to back home early while he had been backing to home he saw his girlfriend with other guy they were hugging .
he arrived the home and he only thought and thought all night it was the second time that she has been unfaithful since then he is alone .
Today in the morning he have not gone to work and he was staying in a pub to drink beer , then a girl went to him , he knew her , she is Abigail .
This girl is an acquantance him .
They were talking about their lives and he remembered like he knew her on the bus , maybe she have always been the woman of his live he looked at eyes and smile he wants to ask her whether now is not late to satart to know her but he decided leave the pub he walked to exit .
Finally Michael closed the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake .
I had a terrible experience in this Chinese New Year!Because Norovirus infected me!At first , I had a high fever but I thought if I take some medicine I will be fine .
Therefore , my condition took a sharp turn for the worse .
I can not eat anything even in New Year 's Eve and I was so tired that I can not play poker with my cousins .
Though everythings were depressing , I still have a wonderful winner vacation with my family : we went to Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village(九族)to visited its blooming cherry blossom.(I do n't know its variety~Is it from Japan??XD)Cherry blossom is very beautiful but there are so many people .
When we went to Sun Moon Lake by cable car , wind is so strong!I felt a little nervous though the scenery amazing .

We are approving an incentive amount of Rs .
1000 per month for K Murli and Rs .
1500 per month for K Sivakumar for working as an Acting Territory In - charge .
We will review their performance in a period of 6 months and accordingly will decide on any upward / downward revision in their salary .
Company also reserves it 's right to discontinue the incentive amount if their performance is not found as per the job description .
My living room is the best room in my house because it is big , comfortable and beautiful .
There are some images for my family on the wall .
There is a coffee table made of wood with a clear glass .
Also on the sofas there are many colorful Pillows
There is a bookcase next to the rocking chair and when I have a free time I sitting on it and reading a book .
There are three sofas around a coffee table and it is so comfortable .
When I want studying for exams going to the living room and sitting front of TV
In addition , there is a small blackboard for my littel brother because my mother wants my prother learn Arabic and English letters .
There is a small gray carpet under the coffee table and it protects the things from breakage .
For this reason I spend most of my time there
On the other hand , the economic situation plays an important role .
It is very common that the bad economy of some countries force their people to emigrate to another country .
When this phenomenon occur most of the migrants need to learn the new language to adapt to the new environment .
As a consequence , they forgot their first language .
Another important point is the necessity of approval by some some indigenous groups or people that emigrate from the countryside to the city in order to get a better lifestyle .
It is not a surprise that this situation is something more frequent every day .
We are facing a crucial moment due to the extinction of most of the indigenous languages .
Public transport will be worse in the future than travelling by car because it is uncomfortable and slowly .
In Spain many people will travel in their car or by car with their colleague or friends , this transport is quick , but it is much more expensive .
If you travel with other people it is the same expens than public transport .
In my opinion sharing a car we will arrive at work on time and when we will finish work we can go directly home .
I think public transport is n't the future because many people today live outside the big cities in the suburbs .
The apartments in the cities are much more expensive and the people prefer to travel in their car .
I think there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
But it 's better to travel by car pooling .
People who needs to go in the same direction , meet each other and use only one car .
This is convenient for the cost of travelling , because every cost is divided for the participants and is an experience to meet other people .
Hi Jo ,
My country very interesting place , we have more ancient and mistyc places .

First of all , thank you professor to teach in the meantime , the entire course of the learn really benefited , especially in the first meeting , for British English , I still did not really understand , it makes me frustrated , but gradually after I found the beautiful of the language in British English , I think it 's all because of the usual problem of American English , and so I really appreciate that you choose simple textbooks and it 's easy to learn , and you really very carefully and very humorous , you 're always careful in curriculum pronunciation correction for each student , using a variety of reading skills let us immerse them read .
I love to listen to British English , but it 's really hard to study , all because we are all learning American English in Taiwan , so when I have the opportunity to contact British English , it 's full of tone cadence , always feel particularly charming , and British culture exudes noble temperament , so British accent sounds like there is always an indescribable elegance qualities .
And the strengths and weaknesses in both of segmental and suprasegmental , I think it 's maybe the learning habit , when I heard a sentences , I would use many varieties of tone and manner to say the sentences again , therefore , I can easily be interpreted illustrations instructions the emotions and feelings .
Only possible in segmental pronunciation , the occasional missed a few notes , such as -d , I did not noticed this because when I deliberately stressed -d , I found the tone and mood more likely to become very weird , this is the biggest problem I 've encountered in pronunciation teaching .
I 'm not teaching English in my new school , but in the future if there is the chance I will definitely give it a try , especially in the curriculum learned some teaching tips , the biggest gain this course is to read picture books to read and record , because that and English proficiency is not just training , but will note that strengthen their pronunciation and intonation , and then each time peer feedback also completed the listening exercises .
If I have an opportunity to back on English teaching , I think I will try this skill to get my students to do the recordings heard training , then make their English better and better .
My village is in the north of the region of the Extremadura .
The population of my village is about sixteen hundred people .
It is situated on the inland .
The first stop for most visitors is the church because the neighbors clean and cared .
The town hall put in the streets containers for trash and the workers of tomw hall clean the streets .
Besides this , everybody cleans their doors to keep it tidies up .
What 's more , all people once a year , plant trees in all village for it is more beautiful .
To begin with , nowadays more and more people prefer trevelling by car rather than by bus or train .
Certainly , it is more comfortable to travel by your own transport with your family or your friends . You can stop and have a rest wherever you want .
You can change your plans and choose another direction .
For differentiate between old computers and computers today , would first have to describe each type of machine .
I start describing old computers which we saw in the video were few simple machines ( at the time they were created ) and covering an enormous room .
On top of that these machines only worked when it is wrote an order to the computer .
These were experiential models .
Visually colors ranging on the screen were the black and green .
Currently in the 21st century , computers have had a very long technology advance which range from the software and the size internal memory ( bigger than the old computers ) , the size of the computer ( which is varied but more smaller than the previously computers ) and its shape , the weight of it ( they are more lightweight ) and variations in the colors of the screen ( visually ) .
Finalize can tell that with the passage of time people we change the way we see the world , comes into play evolution , not only of technology but also of society , religion , etc .
essential in the life of people , but sow will be factors that humans will not be able to modify and it is better to continue as they are .
Sometimes famous people want to be alone without any journalist .
In my opinion , staying alone means that you have something to think about , for example to think about our deeds .
Journalists follow you and they do n't give you to live such as normal pupil .
To tell you the truth , I like being alone very often .
To be on my own and watch the other people live .
I always wear a mask , I can be myself only with my close people .
In the end , I want to tell you that we are not robots , everyone deservs that they want .
My opinion it 's opposite of them of this composition .
I did n't have a car .
Every day I used to taking public transport .
I live in a city , and for many people live like me , the most convenient transport is the public transport .
With a car in the city , we have some problems .
there is a heavy traffic , and the difficulty in finding a parking place .
Every day , the population spends a lot of time in the traffic congestion .
It 's a very good method to travel in the city .
A car problem is the expensive price of the fuel .
I like public transport and I love my planet . I think the best method for reduce the polucion .
It 's used to public transport .
but it 's only my personal opinion .

An Unforgettable Lesson
There are various kinds of different things that happened in peoele 's life , some may be normal and nothings special , while others may be meaningful and unforgettable that you will remerber it for a long time .
Have you ever have this experience ?
When I am in elementary school , I joined a speaking contest , but I failed , and I had broken - hearted .
Becase I seldom practiced it .
But soon I made up my mind , thinking that I ca n't be so decadent forever I want some change , hoping I will be better in the next year .
So I practiced it day and night .
No matter it is sun or rain , wind or warm . And also asked teacher for help .
Eventually , I got number three in the comtest .
Through this time , I learn that win and lose is not the most significant thing .
The most important is that you can learn a valueabe lesson from failure .
Practice can make perfect .
And never give up .
Resolve/ dertermine / insistence
My country witnessed a tremendous change in the last ten years .
10 years ago , I was a child , and I can seldom eat meat in dinner .
But now , I feel uncomfortable without food everyday .
People 's health
Nowadays young people 's health is n't as healthy as for example twenty years ago .
One reason for the change may be due to the style of life that people have .
Currently we do usually less exercise than before because we use our car to go anywhere .
Whereas our style of food has changed very much .
We do n't eat at home and it 's very common eating junk food every week .
On the other hand , children are used to eat only what they want because in general they do n't like legumes , vegetables , fruits , fish ...
They like eating junk food , hamburgers , French fries and sweets and what 's more they do n't do any exercise .
All these reasons could be very bad for their health in the future .
So it 's very important to give them a healthy education .
To sum up , it is very important to be conscious about how food affect our health .
That 's the reason for we have to do more exercise , eat less fat and more vegetables and teach our children to eat better and healthier than they are used to do .
My opinion ofselfemployment
I never ever wanted to be selfemployed .
My dad and my grandfather had run their own business for more than 20 years .
My mother always told me that my dad had never time for her and my siblings .
When I was born my dad decided to quit his company to get more time for his family .
Nowadays , the car owners have been increasing in many countries , especially in developed countries , due to the convenience of travelling by car .
Thus , some people claim that the social trend tends to decline the popularity of travelling by public transport .
As a result , this development is highly controversial in positive and negative ways .
Today personal vehicle become pride of the life , mean if a person is on there personal vehicle they are look as higher status in the society .
so it become a fashion of using personal vehicle which create a lot of problem big one traffic problem .....
now traffic problem is the biggest problem . only solution to this use of public transport system as much as possible .
but now using public transport is looked as person of low status , so there is no future for public transport .
to tackle this problem we have to deliberately think about it .
thank you very much
Our life is keep changing everyday and we notice that huge range of the changing in each decades .
The lifestyle , technological material and the design of cars and houses keep changing annually .
We can admit that our life will be quite different from now to the fifty years later .
Changing is a natural habitat that makes the life more enjoyable to us .
It 's bringing the happiness to and the beauty to us .
For example , we can know the type of a car model by the changes that are made on it which it makes you idiotif the small new details in every model .
Even the kind of house panting can be changed by the time .
Now it is more colorful and designed in different ways Than it was at the past time .
We can not stop changing but we can guide it to the a special benefit which it makes the life easier and more comfortable .
Using the changing method would improve the education system in many aspects especially for people with obstruction .
It is bring the hope to their live and makes them taste the life in way that they had dreamed about it .
In conclusion , the changing of our life can help us to explore different benefits for the changing every decade .
It service the education and entertainment aspects in our life .
My town is very , very big with a lot of people .
More than 12 million people live in our town .
I ca n't say my town is the best place in the world .
The ecological problems are very important for the last years .
First of all - the air .
An enormous quantity of cars and the traffic jams provokes a pollution of air and smog .
The urban authorities can not change the situation cardinally .
But there is an active construction of new roads , road junctions and an improving of roads .
We do n't separate our rubbish .
All rubbish is taken away without separation .
But people are interested in it and this year I saw announcements about days of receiving of separate rubbish .
Our lawns also are the problem .
Several years ago we had wonderful lawns with a lot of local plants and grass .
But the last time the street - cleaners mow all the young grass .
Now our lawns are dirty and without grass .
But I hope our town will be better with our help .
I enjoy watching Tennis in my couch , is weird that I haven't played Tennis because where I live we do n't have that kind of sport , so I just can watch in my TV .
But I hope one day go to a tournament , travel to Spain and watch my favourite player who is Rafael Nadal from Spain .
Since the first time I watched him play , eight years ago was the same year that I started watch Tennis .
I like how the players moved through the court and how the audience applaused them every time they won a point , although I 'm not in the court I could feel the feeling of the game , it 's really awesome .
Once in awhile I enjoyed watch Tennis when there was a competition or tournament , besides I watched and enjoyed it , also could learn how real the game was , which were its rules or what happened when they yelled at the jumpire for a no - reason , all these details you could learn and wait for a coming day to put them in practice or help to the players , is one of the things that I want to make real .
My advice would be that I you want to play Tennis just go ahead play it , not expect till others do it , because you can do that too .
At the beginning it could be a little harsh , but is the same with many others sports when they start , so just keep in mind that you can play Tennis with the most talented players from the world overall .
Travelling by car is much more convenient .
In fact , I agree .
Btu , What about sharing a ride ?
Riding a horse is and old faschion way but still interesting .

Nowadays , Easter is associated more with the spring 's arrival than religious rituals .

My mouth is dry and have an awful metal taste , head aches , still slightly spinning and there is a terrible ringing in my ears .

My best friend .
My best friend had always been like a sister to me .
Our mums had been to high school together , although they 'd never talked a lot .
The first time I met her , she insulted me , but I just did n't pay attention in what she had told me .
It was in school , when we were three years old only !
Even that , we start to talk more and more , until we were what we are nowadays .
She always helps me in whatever I need , and she 's amazing .
She 's always happy and laughing , and never gets angry when I get nervous !
She 's incredible , is like the sister I 'd never had .
In the other hand , she had never been a talktive girl , so it 's usually me who is always talking a lot .
Even so , now she starts to talk more often , and when we started high school we met lots of new friends !
In the future , I 'd like to continue being with her , and talking and having fun as we do together now .
I would n't imagine a life without her , she 's the best person I ever met .

They often notify all the town 's civil that spending a free day on clearing all rubbish on the beach and on the roads of town .
Then , they will gather all rubbish to one place and burn or bury them .
Finally , state usually encourage on the radio , television etc .
It means that tourists and the people of town must have a crucial duty to protect the beach , the roads etc .

Right now , I am wearing jeans , black flats , a gray shirt and a purple and turquoise hoodie .

In modern life , we rely on traffic to work or travel to everywhere .
It is conveninet to travel by private cars .The price of private cars which every one can afford it , so that everyone has the private car nowadays .Some people point out private cars are going to replace the public transport .
I could n't agree with the point of view for some reasons below .
Firstly , the growing number of private cars cause the big problem with traffic jam .People spend extra time on normal travel because of traffic jam .
That wastes people 's time and make people feel exhausted .
Not mention to say , it 's definitely hard to enjoy travelling in holidays .
Secondly , private cars are the main reason for the air pollution . We should consider the protection of environment for human future , not only care about the convenience we can see for now .
In the other hand , public transport system can reduce the amount of private cars in the busy area , like bus and tram .
People can travel through the city easily and safely .
For instance Melbourn , the secondary city in Australia where are trams via through the whole city area .
Therefore people do n't need to drive cars for travelling in the city .
The last point is people go for long journey by public transport .
Public transport bring relaxing holiday and efficient business trip to people without weary long drive .
For these reasons , it is unlikly there is no future for public transport .
On the contrary , We need more public traffice to improve our traffic system and find the better way to maintain the environment .
Alison read the note and it say 's " i 'll be back at 8 pm " .
It was 11 pm and her boyfriend was n't in their house , she started getting confused and temerously .
After waiting for 20 minutes , she decided to call the police ; they said " wait for the morning , maybe he went somewhere , now we ca n't help you " .
After that answer , she was n't satisfied so she decided to start calling all the hospitals of the area .
it was 4 am and she had none answer .
Alison felt desesparate , she notice that her husband 's car were in her house , so he was walking or someone pick up to him , she takes the phone and she call all him group of friends , nobody now anything and now they were scaried .
She was terrified , she starts thinking about the possibility of the death .
She got into her car and look for her husband for all their small city , Pentonville , after half an hour she saw him sleeping in a square .
George had lost her memory , and he could n't went back .
Nowadays , they are living a happy life and everyday Alison has to make him remember their life .
No future for public transport , it is one of problem if that fact .
now days , there are many type of transport in the world , bus taxi , train but train more conform then else , I always used bus in city .
if you to travel from city to city , public transport is cheaper than others .
my favorite sport is playing footboll .
I think that this sport is very happy .
Also , you could learn to be more friendly .
In my opinión , if you want to start to do this sport you could write a team . moreover , I think that it is good because you could help to lose wight .
The statement " public transport is our future " has been an interesting political discuss during years .
On one hand the public transport is good because it does n't pollute so much and you can muve around all the city .
Young people use it a lot .
We do n't use so much petroll like if we each of the passenger to use it own private transport .
In fact you ca n't use it if you have to carry a lot of things or when you have hurry .
In conclusion the public transport is very good and if it desapear it will be a big problem , is right that some times you need a private transport but apart from that the public transport is very use by people of all ages .
Transportation is very important in cities , villages as well as in sub - lines .
Many people has no vehicles , they only depends on public transport due to some reasons .
Any way in some cases , car is very useful to reach the destination very fast .
Public transport provide all the information about routes of the way which we are follow and give a idea to the passengers about the place .
Some times it may be very expensive due their taxes

I await your response , Thank You .
First I would like to intoduce myself , my name is Joaquín Gutiérrez and I tell you why my favourite sport is football which is a sport than I have practiced since I was six years old .
I like very much this sport because it must be play with a gruop of people and is funnier than others sports which you play alone with other opponent , like tennis .
I have confessed that in the first time I did n't like it very much because I was a bit shy boy and I cost a lot of effort to integrate with the other players of the team but with the passage of the time I liked more and more .
Actually I play in the first divission of the club River PLate from Argentina .
I would like to advice for the children who give yours first steps in this sport that is which perseverance and effort you can achieve great treasures .
In the past , I did some exercises .
I have swum in the swimming pool and also I have cycle in my bicycle .
I have run upstairs so many times .
They 're healthy activities .
I went also , to the mountains with my family .
I ate a lot of fruit last year .
I loved the apples !
I always went to my school on foot .
But in summer I went by car .
Last year I gave some dolls of my sister to a charity .
I visited some friends of my parents and I wrote some letters to a friend .
Now , this year , I 'll do more exercises , I'll go with my family to the beach and swim in the sea .
I 'll eat better , I'll walk more , I'll walk more , do good things and speak more with my friends
Do you hear about Islam
What are your sources media or what ?
Can you ask yourself why we are here on earth to entertain or for what ?
Be honest with yourself
At first I would like to tell you that I do not agree with this statement . I could even tell that this opinion is opposite of the present and future situation .
As for me , even if travelling by car is so much more convenient , most people will always travel by a train , railway , bus and other types of public transport .
In my opinion people will travel by public transport more frenquely , because this type of transport is less expensive , more trustworthy and even more ecological than travelling by car .
In the other hand , we can say that it is really uncomfortable to travel by public transport , but even this we can improve in future .
We can discover new ways of travelling , take more care of our public transport and modernise them , so people would be motivated to travel by .
My trust in futuric technology is so enormous that I hope there are going to be a new ecological and cheaper ways to travelling around our world .
If this will happen , people are going to be more social and empatic , not even for peoples emotions , but also for our environment and they will treasure it .
To begin with , there are two ways of cutting down on pollution . which leads to global warming , that became a real threat of our life day by day .
Firstly , start to use renewable energy .
to illustrate , when we use the renewable energy we reduce emissions so , our natural resources will be conserved for our future furthermore sons future .
for example , using wind Energy or Solar Energy for electricity generation we will be used less fuel what is affected in emissions .
Secondly , we should improve our regulations that rules impose people lowering using things make a lot of pollution illustrate , using big vehicles or about building big facilities such as big factories .
As a result , ways to cut down on pollution . for instance , when one person uses a car for 6 people and many people do the same that make a lot of pollution for that we need to improve our regulations to make people use small cars for cutting down on pollution for a better future .
All in all , using renewable energy and improve our regulation is two ways to cutting down pollution for a better future .
Another thing we can do to a better future is avoiding war .
Because , war destroys mankind and countries .
Many wars start because , people do n't know or respect the other beliefs very well thus , we need to learn about belief other people we are live with them .
for example , the fight between Muslim and Hindus in India or in Lebanese civil war .
Secondly , do more cooperation between countries .
To illustrate , people should cooperation To intervene to bring peace to the world to stop the war in many areas like what United Nations doing .
For example , United Nations has taken the decision to ban mandatory weapons against South Africa because of racial persecution policy . in brief , knowing each other and do more cooperation between countries it is to ways to avoid war for a better future .
for that we need to improve our regulations to make people use small cars for cutting down on pollution for a better future .
All in all , using renewable energy and improve our regulation is two ways to cutting down pollution for a better future .
My most terrifying day was January 23rd , last year .
It was a normal Thursday .
I was at school : while I 'm listening to the English lesson I felt a strong headache .
After ten minutes I asked the teacher of called my parents for returned home .
At home , my dad and I had lunch , but my headache did n't finish .
At 2 p.m. my mum decided to go to the hospital because I ca n't undestood nothing and I ca n't talked .
On the hospital the doctor did me a drip and after some hours I felt better .
I do n't ever forget that day !
currently a very significant problem for its social and economic impact is the chaotic public transport in Lima .
To solve this problem Lima has been making long term strategies .
Lima is one of the cities with less road culture in the world .
we do not respect traffic rules to drive only with the intention to go fast as possible to our destination , this often causes traffict accidente and congestion .
For this reason people is becoming acure of the terrible problem and is learning and teaching vial culture to new generations .
Besides public institucions are promoting this and also private companies make advertising for awereness .
Lima is among the top ten cities have the messiest public transport in the world .
This is due to Lima in the beginning has not had a pant to desing its public road s and highways , and it only has been improvising to build their way without any criteria to transport its population .
Currently this issue is so important that governments are investing and working to create solutions such a metropolitan .
I think we have really become aware of the chaos of public transport and we have begun to design and implement strategies that in 20 years our reality improve our reality
In my opinion I believe the public transport will have future , because this transport is very necessary for the people .
In all cities of the world , the people will need the public transport to move around the city .
The people think that the public transport is only the bus , but the public transport is the bus , the taxis , train and subway .
Maybe travelling by car is so much more convenient , but there are a lot of cars and this car produce a lot of smoke and the nature is dying , if we do nothing , the nature will disappear .
I would like the people to take the public transport for travelling , so we will be able rescue the countryside .
I usually take the public transport for going to the University , because the public trasnport is cheaper than the car .
I used my car every day however few a few I started to take public transport for I can to save up money

One day , a little Egyptian boy read a book about Umrah .
He read about rites of pilgrimage and Kabaa .
After he finished the book , he wanted to go to the Kabaa and do rites of pilgrimage .
He closed his eyes .
He imagined he could fly like adragon .
Luckily , he remembered he had the dragon costume and he wore it .
As he pumped down the stairs , wings flapping cross Cairo .
He flied to Saudi Arabia .
Eventually he saw the Kabaa .
As he got closer , he saw alot of people around tha Kabaa .
They drank Zamzam water and wore Umrah clothes .
They was doing rites of pilgrimage .
One there , a man raised his hands and called to the God .
It 's amazing .
He had never seen anything so fantastic , but all too soon , it was time to leave .
He jumped and flapped and waved goodbye .
It had been fun day out but unfortunately he had to be home in the time for bed .
After he had arrived to home , he fell asleep and he started to think of his next adventure ..........
his new book was all about Paris .
My neighbourhood is a very pleasant area , it is big enough and it is so green .
The populations estimated around ten thousand person .
My neighbourhood surround by the large sequences of mountains which they have scenery view .

All amenities that is necessary for your daily life such as fantastic school with perfect teachers and modern building is found .
Transportation does not make a matter because it has got many bus lanes and bus stations .
It is not quiet and it is active city in a different ways .
If you like active city with enormous activity , I guess it is excellent place .
My favourite sport is badminton and I always get up early to play it every day . I like it becasue it is the best way to loss weight and get your health better than medicine .
I think someone should get exercise by starting play some favourite sport instead of watching TV or playing game .
The purpose of this propossal is to provide details abouts shopping facilities in my hometown , Vung Tau , and give some recommendations for tourists .
+ Local shops :
They had a long tradition dating back to the 18 century when Vungtau was a a small commercial port .
Not only are they well - known for its long tradition but it also famous for the hospitality of inhabitants living here which attract domestics and foreign tourists come here to see the famous sights as well as shopping for souvenirs .
They are closely located the local art gallery which take about 15 minutes to go by foot .
They offer a wide range of choice from souvenir items such as pictures , jewellries to local specialities with a reasonble price to suit different interests of people .
You can buy them as a small present to your family members or friends .
I assure that high - quality and various products there should be satisying your needs .
+ Shopping mall
It is conveniently situated in the town centre which takes 5 minutes to walk in a crow flies .
A lot of products such as consumer electronics , foods , souvenirs are sold here .
Compared with local shops , products ' price in shoping mall is considerably higher than that in local shops but it offers more varieties of products .
I highly recommend local shops to our tuorists for its cheap price and the hospitable manners of residents here .
Dear Mrs. Weber and Mrs. Schnappauf ,
good morning firstonce .
Now I 'll introduce myself .
My name is Yusuf Hamid I am 17 years old and I visit the state secondary school in Scheßlitz ,
tob e more precise , I am in the graduating class .
I come from Hallstadt , in close vicinity of Bamberg .
I have 1 older sister and 1 younger brother .
My hobbies are meet Friends and hangout with them or play baskteball in my spare time .
I 'm easily excited and nervous because this oral examination will determine wether i can do my A -level on the college of further education in Bamberg what i really want .
My favourite sport is play soccer .
It 's played by eleven players who try to score a goal during ninety minutes .
There is a grass floor , but it 's also played on artificial grass .
I really enjoy playing it because it 's very exciting because everything could happens .
I usually playing it with my partners and my friends which do the game even more fun .
I hardly recommend whoever to play soccer , because i 'm sure that they 're going to enjoy it very much .
It 's also a full sport because people will improve their health condition .
First I want to say is that people use the car like luxury objet , not as transport machine .
People spend their first salary to buy a car .
So , normally the use of the car is for pleasure .
Peolple do n't use the five seats of the car to go to travel .
From the point of view of the invaironment this is a bad idea because spend a lot of gas by person .
The cities are crowded and there are a lot of pollution with noises and smoke .
A new problem is being in the small cities , because they are not disigned to harbor a lot of cars .
I think that the main problem of the piblic transport is the infrastructure between villages and small cities , because they only exit between the great cities .
Some countries have a good net of intrastruture and people use then mainly , because the public transport is cheaper than the car and more quickly .
It is a problem of mentality , if we had born in a society that used the public pranspor I thought that is the better and we would use then normally .
In my own town , people do n't use public transport , some months ago the council gave a public sercice bike and three months later they had to close it .
It is a pity .

The television can entertain , and also educate the people .
Have so many educacionals programs , like Animal Planet , and so many others .
Sometimes , some tv shows are so great that helps you in determinate class , for example , Animal Plante can help you in biology , The History can help in history , etc ... In my opinion the television can be good as books , and can also be a form of learning as good as only reads books , because TV is something fun , so you can learn and have fun at the same time .
Series also can help you to study , for me it helped me a lot because I love series and some q I watch helped me in school , such as breaking bad , which helped me in chemistry , and so many others .
last year I saw a movie called ' ' side by side '' , and talked a little of life in old history , and coincidence I was having this matter in school , then it helped me a lot .
in my opinion the television can entertain as can educate people on different ways .

Everyone says that our lifes are going to change in the future but that is what everyone says .
Right ?
In the future I really want my grandchildren to be happy that is all I ask for . I may be young but I think I do n't see myself living on earth in the next 50 years i mean dream does not hurt .
I question myself everyday how can i survive in this madness world ?
I do not know how to answer this question honestly but i guess i will never know .
I think that public transport has a great future because every time there are more people who use it .
However , I think it is very expensive but with a decrease in the cost there would be more people .
Nowadays have a car is very expensive because you have to pay a lot of thinks .
Public transport would have more future if it were better distributed .
Personally , I use more public transport but I hardly ever use private transport
Baja California is bigger than Aguascalientes for the beaches and tourist cities .
The transportation is practical because not all places are search , use more the car , truck and sometimes boat .
The tourist will never be able bored and will have much time to visit the city .
Baja California weather is not as cold as Chihuahua .
When you go to the beach you have across a large avenue to get there walking .
I 'm very tiring day , when I go and went straight to bed .
The last few days that I was in Baja California I 've got very little time for shopping and go to the beach .
Dear Jo ,
How 's it going ?
Well I think you have chosen the best idea , because there are
more places to visit in Italy .
First I believe you can travel from north of Italy to the south , in
order to see all the best places that we have , like Milan , Rome and
Lecce .
Find a job in Italy is n't as easy as you think , because the
economic system is in crisis , so it 's hard just for Italian , thinking for
foreign people .
But it 's not all , since you know two languages , maybe you can find
a summer work in a travel agency , because they need someone to
reception who can speak another language over Italian .
I will find out someone who know the agency 's manager , and you will
have sent me your curriculum after the weekend , because he will surely want it .
I 'm very glad to read you again ,
Ettore .

I think the car is more convenient for public transport .
In the car you do not have a timetable to be respected , you 're free to leave , to go home when you want ... not sit still to snow , rain , cold .
And without getting stuck in a city for delays for drivers . on public transport there is the possibility that you 're standing on the whole trip , there is always a lot of people , is cold in the winter and in the summer it 's too hot .
trips are longer on public transport or by car .
although I do not know if this would always choose the machine .
By reading the history , we can know that some disasters happened every the year of Jaiwu .
And there is no exception this year .
There happened several serious natural or man - made disasters in this year .
In Taiwan , a serious air crash caused by the bad weather happened first .
A terrible explosion resulting from carelessness followed .
A storm of food problems broke out next .
In the global , up to three air crashes which result from being hijacked or shot happened .
There were also conflicts between western countries and the ISIS .
In my opinions , all of us are supposed to be careful about all the details when we deal with everything to prevent disasters .
Additionally , all human beings should stop fighting and devote ourselves to pursuing a peaceful world .
Last but not least , we should do everything with our conscience .
Hope that the next year will be better .
Frankly it seems that the town that I have been living have not taken care about the environment .
It is easy to see when we walking around or when we go to some walk .
In general we do n't take care about nothing , water , recyclable things even our air conditioning .
This is such a chronic problem in all my country .
Here in Brazil is very difficult take care about it because it demands serious behaviour and skills from our gorvernants which unfortunatuly wo n't happens in a short time .
Although Brazil passed through several changes since last 40 years , the main one haven't started yet and I am talking about Education .
Our government prefer keep our population without information , because it is easier to manipulate their mind .
And why am I talk about it ? I am talk about it because the foundation of environment care is our minset , just with knowledge and information we will be able to manage actions to save , protect and improve the environment , and reverse we have the current result .
So if we believe it is a kind of important subject to take care , we need to move fast and our first step should be our election process .
A house is made of walls and beams ; a home is built with love and dreams .
this aphirism is famous and truth .
People try to build big and laxuries house but they forgot about the main .
it is warm which is needful for us .
we can have really good house where are many furniture , space and ornaments .
we can choice expencive things for interior .
but these things are not important if there is not comfortable atmosphere .
we have to invest our love , dreams , patient . and as a result we can create the best house ever .
building our house we make the most important place for us .
so we have to follow our dreams and create a warm and cosy place
In this report I am going to talk about how in my town take care of the environment .
First at all , I ask the council for this great problem which is the pollution and the way to solve it .
He is aware that the growth of the pollution is a big problem and that must be taken mesuares for trying to solve it .
It is not easy way but it is necessary to do it .
n the town he tries that the people have to aware about the sitiations and they take care the environment
On the other hand , the ask is if this solution could be enough or no .
The " green " organisations want to believe the problem is serious and that radical political solutions are needed .
In my opinion we should take conciencious and stop it , if we don , t stop it , after it will be later .
Me and my family .
I love my family , we argue hardly ever !
I do lots of activities with them ..
For example : we go to the restaurant , we go to see my brother 's football match , we eat or stay at home all together .
We sometimes do presents at the party like the Birthday ...
The best present that I receive was ... I do n't remebmer !
Another thing , at my home there are some rules : I and my brother tidy our room , we clean the bathroom when we use it , we ca n't eat in the sofà ..
I always try to follow rules but I sometimes break them because I 'm lazy !
I do n't argue with only one of my family .. I sometimes argue with my brother for television channels but we make up immediately .
With my parents I argue about school , how I use my mobile phone , how I speak with them ..
My last argue with my family was yesterday
I 'll talk about Kingdom Of Saudi Arabia , Riyadh City specialty .
First , you should know is the weather , we have a very cold winter and a hot summer compared with the other countries in the middle east .
If you want a city with sea you should choose any city in the west or east of Saudi Arabia .
Riyadh is the capital City it 's in the center of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia .
All the stores and malls are closed at mid night include the five prays breaks because we need to go for pray for work you need to know what the major you want to work in so I can help you to search for a good job matching you abilities .
after what I told you about my country I hope you like it .
I will write about my village .
My village has around 700 residents
My village is between a river and a mountain .
It has a lot of beautiful things how an old church of century XV but this church is in ruins but the new church also is very beautiful and comfortable .
My village has a wall of the stone , this wall was built by resident of the village in 1715 .
Other interesting place in my village is the square with his source
Also there the same supermarket , bar and restaurants .
For many years , people use public transport to go to work to study and to travel .
So , we use trains , buses and bikes to transport from place to place .
let us discover the aventadges and disavandges the
I think that a public transport will have future by the many reasons .
The car could be broken .
Man could have some problems with his health .
For example , if man had broke a leg , it might be hard to drive a car .
Also , for somebody it could be cheaper to travel by a bus , especially for a tourist from a foreign country .
Sometimes are better to travel by the bus because of thorny road .
Bus is one of the democracy transport , which is used by the students , kids , adults , rich and poor people .
When you are travelling with a big company , it is a best decision to travel by the bus .
Because everyone has a place in the bus .
And it 's funny and exciting to travel with the group by the bus .
Nowadays , people has a stressfull live so we ca n't spend time waiting for public transport .
We can think that there is no future for public transport because most of people use their own car .
Using your own car you can take the decision of what timetable is more convenient and what way your are go to use .
It 's more confortable go anyway with your own car , the problem is the pollution that this life bring us , and also the park problem .
If everybody go with their own car , their have to park and maybe the place is full .
Also , travelling by car is so much more convenient because you do n't have to go stopping in each town , so using your own town saves time .
Nowadays , people are really worried for their jobs due to the big financial crisis in which some people are lost their jobs and other are working in rubbish jobs for little money .
For all this , the question is too difficult to answer .
In my opinion , the most important is enjoy your work because we spent an average of nine hours in the office or in whatever work that we will do , as a result if you do n't feel comfortable , your life could be a hell .
The truth is , that the perfection would be that all people could work in their dream jobs and of course , making a lot of money , like for example Hollywood actors or football players but this is almost impossible .
In summary , for me , it is better enjoy at work every day , although you have not a big salary .
The most important is wake up each day with a big smile and work hard .
The scorch trials is one of the best films and thriller that I have ever seen , it is so exited all the thing that they do to survive in the outside world with all those people that are infected with a virus and the reason why they put them in the glade for them to be inmune if some sick person bite them .
one of the most amazing parts of the film is when Teresa calls Cruel for go for them and take them again to the Cruel building and like all of them does n't wanna go with them they start a war and they take Mihno with them and at the end Thomas decide to go after them and he give a super great speech for all the persons go with them and help him to get back Mihno , and what i really want to see in the next film is that if Thomas is mad at Teresa ( i never like her ) and if they get free and the world comes back to the normal world .

Usually her dog had a blue color but at that moment it was Red
Recently , I have seen the Tarantino 's new film , Django Unchained , and I have to recognize that I am looking forward to watch the next one .
He took down every mistake he made last films .
Firstly , Django Unchained remembered us the hard life suffered by black people in the past , due to a great introduction without dialogues , where black people were unchained while they came back to be selling to an owner farm , it being matching with an amanzing soundtrack as identity Tarantino 's films .
Nowadays , In many country the youth looking for doing sports to be fitness and very active there are many sports to join it .
On the other hand , there are some arguments for sport specially volleyball .
When I play volleyball I totally forget all my problems and focus on nothing but volleyball and the intensity of the game .this game i like to play .
The kind of stress that pushes me to work harder in order to get good at what I love .
In addition to this It pushes me to keep on trying so that I can get everything right .
It 's all about will power and the absolute want to get better .
On the one hand , there are alot of famous player on volleyball who had Knee ligament injuries , The most frequent mechanism of injury was landing from a jump in the attack zone .
In addition to this , Injuries were more frequent during games than training .
In my opinion , Volleyball must then be considered among high - risk sports according to the frequency and gravity of our surgical findings.my advice for who starts this sport you will get fresh after you play this game and makes you doing your work in relaxetion way .
I believe there are numerous possibilities on public transport because cars and public transport play completely different roles in our society .
First of all , public transport probably meets the demands of people who hardly or do n't use their cars to travel .
In Japan , which has one of the largest population over 60s , many senior people prefer to use buses to cars .
In addition , a new generation appear and they do n't own their cars because of a few opportunities to travel and high cost of having a car on their own .
Second , public transport provides a quick and easy way to visit unfamiliar places with us .
It is not necessary for us to know in advance how to get to the destination before the departure by using public transport .
So it prevents us to open maps to confirm every single route .
Lastly , we can use less resources by using public transport .
When it comes to our environment , the use of transport could be a solution for reducing the emission of CO2 .
Because of these reasons , I see a blight future for public transport .
it is out of the question the take care of the environment is regarded as turning point in our life .
it is upstearm that irrigates our economic life . and no doubt that Negligence has the ability to destroy many good sides in our life .and our government is doing her best to put end to negligence .
but we also must coparation to save our town . on the other hand we must Presentation awareness program for all people .
and we must throw rubbish in the street to keep the area clean and we must Maintain clean trees to keep the area attractive thus we can improve National income by attracting many people from other town . and we must lern children that clean is necessary for their health and on their school they should throw rubbish on Waste basket and who throw it on the ground Will be punished . to top it all we ca n't go without Cleanliness of our town .
Natural environment destroyed that is a people focus on frequently problem .
Many countries build more and more buildings affect people quality of life .
Setting up more large building can destroyed people and animals live environment and some animals maybecan extinction .
Governments should do some measures to deal with build more buildings will destroy the ecological environment .
There is no future for public transport , becasue travelling by car is so much more convenient .
I 'm not agree abaout this statement becasue in a big cities there are a lot of cars , if all people in a city use his own car at the same time , there will be a huge traffic , so travelling by car is n't much more convenient in this situation .
There are more problems in big cities , one of them is parking , there are a lot of areas in a city that is very difficult to park , and you only have 2 options , you can park in a private parking and pay a lot of money or you can waste you time searching for a place of parking .

the party is the next week on Julias house , it is going to start at 5:00 pm
My favorite sport is swimming .
I engaged in swimming in nine years old .
I had gotten first prize in a match .
As a result , I think that I have some intellent on swimming .
Since then , I meet my teacher in the pool .
She teach me a lot of things , and be the most important figure in my life .
She is a doctor , she told me that swimming will let my body more better .
From then on , I fell my disease in decreasind and fell relax .
Consequently , I need to swim usually .
First of all , swim can help your health .
The research declined that swim can decrease disease .
Second , swim can relax yourself .
When you in the water , you will feel relax .
Third , swim can get more friend .
You can go to the swimming club , that is a way to meet people with interesting of same .
You can try this sport from now on .
Running
I am fond of running !
Many people think running is a wasting time or it 's very difficult but I do n't agree .
Firstly , you will be stronger , enduring .
I started with three kilometers for one jog .
Now my average jogging is 8 - 10 kilometers and going on 40 - 50 minutes .
My best result is 15 km , but I guess awhile .
Secondly , you will be healthier .
I am less having a cold .
Even if I have a cold , I will get out and will run 4 - 5 km .
After that on the next day , I feel myself better .
Four years ago I had often cold and recovery long period .
Now I have more energy and health to become happier .
Thirdly , you will be more confident .
I started running four years ago .
Cause of this was hurt my leg .
After rehabilitation I continued feel hurt in my foot and I still limped .
I decided to stop this and one gorgeous morning I starting running !
As result , I know the men can be harder than can be seem .
After these moments , you starting doing things that many people think impossible or even unbelievable .
My recommendations for beginners .
1 ) Improve yourself in a gradual way .
I advise start from one km .
2 ) Work systematically .
Two - three jogging in a week is norm for beginners .
3 ) Grow up .
First week one km , second one km and 300 meters etc .
4 ) Think about your initial physical conditions .

Is Physical Education necessary at schools ?
First of all , It is true that not all the people like do sports because they are heavy and a bit stressful too .
We can also say that there are other subjects more important than Physical Education , like Biology or History .
However , Physical Education is necessary because makes people less lazy .
Despite the fact that sports are heavies , doctors are always saying that sports improves our health .
Schools have Physical Educations for teach this good habit since our childhood .
In conclusion , Physical Education are necessary at schools because sports improve our health and make us feel good and healthy .
I would like to make a reservation for the next month , from 24th may till 28th ( 4 nights , Double room ) but I have doubts about booking policy .
I mean , after reading the terms and deposit policy , I understand I must pay the first night at the booking time and the rest of the stay it would be paid upon arrival to the front desk .
Plus , in case I cancelled the reservation 48 hrs before arrival it would charged the 5% of the full stay .
I understand this part , but in case I have to cancel the reservation , how should I do it ?
By phone , by mail or on your website .
To begin with I would like to say that doing a sport is very important to keep us thin and healthy .
My favourite sport is swimming because it is the one I have been practising for a long time ago since I was a kid .
I like swimming because it is a sport that makes me work all my body and it is also a really complete sport .
Nowadays it is really important to know how to swim because when we are in holidays we spend most of our time in the water at the swimming pool or even at the sea .
I like other sports such as football and volleyball too .
I would give the advice that this sport makes people healthy but it also help us to make new friends because while we are training we have mates in our team which we can talk to and make them our friends .
Otherwise it is a sport where you do not have contact with your friends what helps not to make injuries .
To conclude , I think this is a really good sport to start with when we are a little child to gain experience and year after year becoming better and improving .
No wonder if we say that sport is so important .
It keeps our bodies in good condition .
Actually there are two kinds of sports .
First one is individual sports and in this kind you practice your game alone and you are the only player on your team .
Second kind is team sports .
In this kind , you are one of the team and all the team play as a one person .
A lthough some people prefer individuIal games , but I prefer team games .
Because it teach as the meaning of cooperation and leadership .
Team sports are very important and they include a lot of kinds .
My favourite team sport is football .
I play football every day with my friends at club .
I found football interesting because it teach us a lot of morals such as cooperation and onest .
I also can get fun with my friends when I play it .
I think it is the most interesting sport
Famous people definitely deserved to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
I think everyone should have their private lives .
In our world lives many personalities , more or less known , such a film - stars , music - stars and so on , but why they ca n't have normal lives ?
They also have families , they also sleeps , have friends , and that 's normal . We can look at them like aliens .
Honestly , if I were in their shoes I would n't stand it .
I would feel like a prisoner , who ca n't do anything , because someone will make a photo of it , and I wo n't have peace .
Actually I have to admit , that , film stars , politicians and other famous people have to count on fame .
They must know , people will identifie them , walking through the street .
They ca n't complain , because it 's the way of life they choose .
In my opinion , everyone deserves for calmness .
Dear Sir ,
With reference to your advertisement in the current issue of the summer camp job , I am writing to you to apply for it .
In the advertisement you state that you need a person who has skills for job with children .
I would like to tell you that I have done a course in which I have learnt to organise all kinds of activities with children since canoeing from swimming competitions , also , I worked in a summer camp last yaer where y could put all the things that I have learnt in practise and it was a very pleasant experience which I would like to do it again .
Because of that , if you want , I will send you a recommendation letter from my boss in that camp .
In addition to that , I am well organised at the kitchen and I can cook a lot of different dishes .
I would be very grateful if you would consider my application .
I look forward to heraing from you as soon as possible .
Yours sincerely .
Hi Paul ,
it 's great to hear from you .
Everything 's ok .
The concert was just flubbergasted .
What a pity , that you haven't been there .
If I knew about the thing before I would invite all my mates .
It really was amazing , I think , it was a breakthrough in my perception of music .
What 's more , I did n't have to pay for the ticket , because it was a volunteer work - closing the door after people that were coming out of the concert hall .
The good thing about it was the fact , that the band(actually I even do n't remember it 's name)was playing with so much passion , that no one probably even think about leaving the place .
In a word , doing nothing was the big advantage of this kind of work .
There were many things that just stunned me in one moment , when the band started to play ...
First of all , Balkan music turned out to be one of the most irresistible kinds I have ever heard .
In my opinion music like this should be diplayed more often in the radio and other mass media .
The bad thing about it is that the band is not popular , and not many people have ever heard about it .
Mass media do not want to introduce this kind of music , probably because it would displace the mainstream - pop music .
See you soon !
Take care ,
Jim

Many people all around the world love football .
Football is such a beauty sport because it is really a fun in a lot of many ways .
Football is my favourite sport and I think it is never going away in my life .
I love football because there 's a lot of enjoyment in it .
I play football for Waitakere college school first eleven as a deffender and I enjoy playing that position because it is easy for me to play .
I used to dream of playing for barcelona and because barcelona has good players I like I , for example Lionel Messi .
Because where I was born there was n't any chance for me to practise football so I can become really good like other players .
But even though I will never get a chance of playing for my dream team I still enjoy playing football . I can play with people who are good and I still have fun .
I advise young kids to train hard and play football because there 's a lot of fun .
Once you start playing football , on a young age you get really better at football .
The last hotel I went was one the best one of my holidays .
" The heaven " , this was its name , was a nice small hotel near the seaside in the south of Italy , near Paestum exactly .
When we arrived there , last summer in July , the owners welcame us with a magnificent basket of fresh fruits in the room and a variety of drinks in the fridge all included in the room 's fee .
Any room in the hotel has a balcony which overlooks on the sea so every morning , when you wake up , you hear the sound of the waves breaking on the beach .
During our stay all the staff was friendly and always available .
Even if all meals were delicious and plentiful , you could also drink or eat special snacks while you were on the sunny beach .
I would recommend this hotel to anyone because there you will completely relax and really it will seem to you I you were in heaven !
My Favourite Sport - Football .
There is perhaps notthing more pleasant than when your favourite sport is as healthy as enjoyable .
I believe that many people would agree with me , as football is the most faurite sport in the world .
Since I was five I have enjoyed playing football with my friends in front of our block of flats .
It all started very naturally .
The ball was object which provided us with lots of fun while we kicked to it and had friendly matches .
As time went by , football remains my favourite sport .
It still gives me great fun within incredible company of my friends and it keeps me fit as well .
The best time for football is a sunny day after recent rain when ground is nice and soft and air is fresh .
Football is great sport for everyone men , women , children , adults , even elderly people enjoy it .
As someone who has played this sport for ages , my advice to people starting this sport is : get right equipment , find friendly team , and enjoy the game .
Soon you will also enjoy your improved condition and better health .
I definitely recommend this sport to everyone who wants to keep fit , have fun amongst their friends , and live happy life .

Tom and I have been training for a long time .
We knew we had a competition and that it was a really hard one .
The other team was profesional , they had won many competitions , they were really good but Tom and I knew that we could won .
Our competition was on Monday , we had one day left .
We made a schedule with all our training days and hours .
Another day was starting , another day of training , our last one .
We had to make the last effort to reach the point we wanted .
Winning , we knew it had a cost but one that we could achieve .
On that last day of training , we started with a light run .
Tom was really tired and it was really weird because it was not a hard run , I knew it was because of the nerves .
After the run we continued with our daily routine .
After three hours of training , Tom and I were extremely exhausted .
I told tom I wanted to talk about our achievements before we went home .
Tom said he was really happy and proud of us .
He also thanked me and told me that if it was n't for me he would n't even think about playing tennis in a professional way .
It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .

Sport is an important for all of us because it helps us avoiding disease , and becoming healthier .My favuorit sport is swimming .So practising this kind of sport is the best because it helps me feeling fresh and relax .
Moreover , daily excrsise is very good idea which helps us to avoid overweight and to keep your body healthier .So I always want to advise people to practise this sport or other kind of sports to avoid diseases .
Two movies .
During the last months , we could see a huge number of new movies issued by many famous European and American majors .
The two I have enjoyed the most are " The wolf of Wall Street " and " The Secret life of Walter Mitty " , or more simply " Walter Mitty " .
The first one is basically based on a true story of the main character , a financial broker , who is acted by the famous Hollywood actor Leonardo di Caprio and on how he become rich by breaking the rules and speculating on the stock exchange market .
I would define it an action movie .
Walter Mitty instead deals with the fantastic story of the main character , an archivist , whose life will been changed completely when the company he works for is taken over by one of its competitors .
Walter Mitty is acted by an excellent Ben Stiller , now arrived at the top of his career as actor .
Far from the noisy and reality of The Wolf of Wall Street , Walter Mitty offers to the audience a delicious portrayal of the main character 's life and adventures , through which he will discover his true self and will restart a new life .
Although presenting a more vivacious plot , The Wolf of Street is not able to keep the attention of the audience like Walter Mitty does .
I must say that The secret dream of Walter Mitty is a well - constructed movie that I strongly recommend to anyone who would spend a great evening watching an entertaining movie .

It is undoubtedly true that in today 's modern world people commute to work mostly by their private vehicles .
It seems more convenient to them to move on their own rather than tied to a public transport .
It can be argued that public transport system has been loosing its popularity in many ways .
People feel that they can get to their destinations on time if they drive their own car .
It is true in many cases as public transport like buses , trains and trams have their own specific routes and stops .
This may cause people in getting late to their particular destination .
Secondly , public transport seems to be going expensive day by day which has reduced its popularity .
People therefore find cars more affordable for them .
In modern society cars have become more cheaper to buy , which in turn has helped people to have them .
Moreover , many car finance companies have made it easy for every individual to purchase the car .
In conclusion , i would say that due to recent advancements in society , there has been a considerable increase in the car ownership .
It can therefore be predicted easily that there will be no role of public transport in the future .
I think that when you want to get famous because of something that you do ( for example : writing musical ) you have to accept what comes with it .
It 's true that sometimes paparazzi cross the line and invade their private properties which I find awful .
However , there are also those kinds of people that get famous for doing nothing or just being rich as it 's the case of Paris Hilton .
That makes me wonder who really deserves fame and who does n't , but fame is not the same as being remembered .
We can see that people get famous when they die , so , journalists are basic to create a negative or positive point of view of that person .
They are just people , but not like you or me , or at least I do n't have a fabulous ferrari to comfort me when I 'm sad .
" Nowadays , older people are disadvantaged because they lack the ability to use technology confidently . " Do you agree or disagree ?
The difficult to learn something .
In our word it 's impossible to live without using technology .
Some people said that the world could be better if it 'll return to the past where the life was more simply .
But this is an anachronism .
It 's impossible to stop the science .
The question is whether the older people are disadvantage in using technology in confidential way .
One can not ignore that it 's more easy for young people to improve their knowledge than the older .
It depends on the capacity of children to learn more fast than the old adults .
There are not doubts : young people use technology much more easily than old people .
By the way , in my opinion , if someone , for example explain well and calm the use of new technology to an old man or woman , at the end , also these people are in conditions to use it .
New technology consists , for instance , in smart phone , tablet , pc .
There are some old people who are interested to know how work technology , but others who are not interested at all .
For these last one , it 's not necessary to use technology , because they can continue to live without using it .
To conclude , if it 's true that not all people use technology confidently , who is interested can be involved in using new technology even if the final results could be lower than their expectations .
Dear Sir/ Madame ( director the film department )
I am writing this letter , because the last week I read a notice in your STUDENT FILM CLUB magazine about a movie or thriller that I like it and I can advise you .
Well , last Sunday , I went to the cinema and I watched THE TITANIC , perhaps the movie counts us , the typical story the rich girl falls in love with the poor boy .
But the best of all for me is the sinking of the ship , when it fell down to bottom of the ocean .
the film explains us how happened the fact of the same way that in the near XIX century .
The director has wanted to make the story the best real possible .
He explains us the building of the ship , why it sank , how it stood in the bottom ocean and how the people helped them one to others .
I really like the beginning of the movie , because we can see the ship when it was really new , with their chair , table and another furniture .
In my opinion I think that the love story is enclosed to explain better the sinking .
I look forward to hearing from you .

Its location is in the western part of Bucharest .
Regarding the actual shopping , it has more than 30 shops with a variety of things , from fashionable clothes to delicious food and even squaint books .
Moreover , it is a source of entertainment starting with children to elders .
In fact .
it has 2 different cinemas , one with Imax option .
Another part of Bucharest for shopping is Unirea Shopping Centre .
Called in a malicious way , there are 6 floors for jewerly , clothes , accessorises , gadgets , books etc .
On the last floor is the food court , closed aired which is by far too populated and full of smoke .
Being in the centre of Bucharest , you can go outside , in downtown to consider visiting new cultural things while shopping in boutiques and relaxing on a terasse with a cool lemonade .
Most of the time , clothes are handmade and original .
In addition to that , cheap is the best word describing the costs .
To sum up , it would seem that Downtown is a preferable place , with better value for money .
Although using your own car is betten for moving around the city , public transport has shown to be a good way for travelling lost distances with a low cost and , depending on its quality , also low budget .
There is not probably a bright future for public transport if it does n't develop as it should in the world we are living today ; that is , if enterprises continue with their current already old - fashioned business model , for sure they will lose customers , and so , benefits and weight in the transportation world .
In conclusion , this kind of transport will have to enhance if the companies in charge want citizens to use their buses , trains and other public vehicles in the future .
Those improvements may include lowering the price , reducing the times or offering new destinations and more resources .
Working holidays abroad
Introduction
The aim of this report is to share the experience of different students who had been working abroad during the summer .
In order to do so , I conducted interviews with 30 university students .
Pros
Every single one of them said that if you work abroad , you will improve your English a lot since you will be listening and speaking it all day .
In addition , another advantage is that by working all summer you can earn some money for your personal expenses .
Cons
However , almost every student confessed having felt homesick despite the fact that they made a large amount of friends there .
Another drawback is that unless you are really motivated , it will be difficult for you to adapt to a new city .
Conclusion
Even if there are some disadvantages , most students agreed that this is an amazing experience not to be missed .
All in all , I suggest encouraging students to find a job abroad during the summer .
there are few things which I am very keen and passionate of , in the whole world .
one of these it 's surely my sport .
I have been practicing swimming pool since I was six years old , now I am twenty one . this should not let you stay without a clue of how much I care about my hobby .
This is not just a sport but an extraordinary thing I do in the ordinary life , in the everyday life .
When I am tired , stressed , depressed , frustrating , sick of the passing fancies or fake friends , there is just one thing that is able to make me feel better and snap out of it : this is , of course , swimming .
So I let myself drop in the water of the pool , and as soon as I am completely submerged , all the problems , sadness and heaviness of life suddenly disappear , and that 's the most amazing emotion i could ever try .
If I had to suggest a sport to do for children , I would recommend it because whether it makes everyone be in shape , it is healthy and guarantee an upper level of wealth .
I advise the parents to let the children begin swimming as soon as they can , provided they are interested in it .
It is not worth saying each one should follow their passions .
I 'll finish saying that even when I was young if my father had asked me if I would have rather go to a swimming race or to a candy fair , I would have surely chosen the first one .
I find it difficult to have a healthy way of life currently .
First of all the environment is contaminated and these substances get to us by water , air , food ... also the clothes .
We ca n't avoid electromagnetic waves around , although we were living in the country or far from the industries .
If you want to live with health , you must understand it and try to choose between the few real options you have in your hands .
The main advice it would be to have a balanced diet : a lot of fruits and vegetables , few fats , to drink more water , etc .
Then it is very important to exercise because your body and your mind need movement .
If you do not have enough time for exercise every day you can make little efforts : do not use the lift , use the stairs or walk every time you can .
But the most important thing for having a healthy life is to be quiet , not feel stress .
Nowadays we have a hurries lives but we must stop and live our lives too .
Your health needs calm , friendship , happiness ... You must keep in contact with your friends and to spend time with yourself ( do not forget your hobbies and learn new things ) and your familiy .
I think it would be the best advice .
It is known that Internet makes things easier than ever and can be used for everything .
Some people believe that we ca n't even live without it .
One of the advantages of the Internet is that we can meet new people around the world and make friends without talking face to face .
There are plenty of webs that can search people , meet them and chat with the same interests and commons you like .
I have very good friends thanks on the Internet .
However , there are a lot of malicious software around the Internet and you must be aware .
You do n't have to do the silly or illegal things , because you will be exposed to this malicious software .
In addition , that software is created by nasty people that creates this virus to damage other people computers .
In my opinion I must express the facilities given by the Internet .
It 's all so easy with it and useful , for example you can order a pizza to take to your home
To sum up , I 'm totally agree with making friends through the Internet .
Did you know that your brain is exercised when you read any books ? You should read the topic that you prefer like news , sports , novels , economics , health , fitness , food , cooking and you can choose the material that it 's easy and enjoyable to read like novels , magazines , newspaper , technical books and something like that .
Why do I recommend it ?
When you have finished your studies and you have gotten a job where every day you do the same activities , the brain does n't work hard and you might have some problems like forget words , dates , information that you had learned a few years ago because your memory wo n't work in the same way .
I think that your brain is like your body , they both need exercise to be active and the way to get it is reading something .
I 'm sure if you read or listen to audio book just 1 hour every day , you are going to feel a change quickly . I know that getting reading habits is difficult , but you start to do it , you wo n't be able to get enough of them and you will read for pleasure .
Finally , if you get Reading habit you 're going to organize better your ideas and you may feel more energetic , if you do n't believe me , just try it .
Dear Sir or Madame
I wish to apply for the post of worker in an USA summer camp that was advertised in the newspaper this Monday .
This occupation is of great interest to me as it reflects my determination in life and requires my education , skills and experience .
With majors in linguistics ( to be more precise , the English and Chinese languages ) , I have recently garnered second higher education in psychology .
This follows that on the one hand I have extensive knowledge in how to be on good terms with different people and on the other hand I have a perfect coomand of English .
Two years ago I worked as an interpreter and an organizer of Waterski World Championship in Moscow .
In addition , as I was determined to build my career as a teacher since my very childhood and , moreover , I definetely have a way with children of any age , after graduation I gained experience at University and local school .
I have been teaching English for 5 years already and I would dare to say that this job was made for me .
In terms of my personality , I am very hardworking , enthusiastic to wide range of activities , open and friendly .
My opinion is rooted in my experience so I really enjoy interacting with people , especially children , and to tell you the truth I like cooking and experience new things in general .
I feel these skills would allow me to perform effectively in this posistion .
My enclosed resume outlines my experience in greater detail .
I welcome the opportunity to meet with you and look forward to hearing from you .
Sincerely ,
Mary J.
Badminton for every Age
It 's fast and it needs a lot of athletic skills .
A wise man in the past said once , " If you want to be a good badminton player you need the nerves of a climer , the strength of a shot putter , the condition of a marathon runner and the elegance and cleverness of a fencer . "
Badminton is my favourite sport art .
I feel happy after every game .
It 's exhausing and you have to move fast to get every birdy .
You have to be competitiv !
You can play it in every age .
I started when I was seven years old in my first class .
My coatch was very nice and mostly we played in teams .
I had a lot of fun at the sommer sport camps and I met a lot of friends .
With the badminton club in our city we traveled to different city 's and countries .
If you want to start playing badminton you should look for a badminton club near by and should sign up for a training class .
If you do n't know what racket you should buy , you will get all information at the club .
Mostly the Badminton Clubs sell all kinds of Badminton equipment for beginners and professionals . Do n't be lazy !
When you start playing you should practice minium twice a week , better three times a week .
Envide your friends from school or work .
Practice together with people in your age is a lot of fun und you will get better soon .
I play usually three times a week and I had a tournament last weekend .
It was very exciting , because there were many people from all over the region .
I lost a few games , but that 's okay .
Every lost game gives me more motivation to practice harder and every won games makes me proude and smile for all the hard work that I have done in the last few mounth .
In our Badminton Club we have a lot of members over the age of sixty years old .
I hope I can still play when I get to that age .
The sport keeps you healthy and fit .
It has been a long time since I watched a thriller , but I do remember that I watched The Hunger Games part 1 , and I recommend all the Hunger Games films .
Those films are really good , you have drama , romance , and thriller , those films are very entertaining .
I think you are going to like them because you like that kind of movies and also they are worth the while and you are not going to regret it .
Another thriller that is really good is the cabin in the woods , that movie is really entertaining , and scary .
if you like scary thrillers this movie is the one for you to watch , i do n't remember it very well , but it is also mysterious so you are going to like that one
This place does n't appear in History books , however it symbolises better than others a change in our country .
This building is situated in Barcelona , although it 's only a short walk from the magnificent Gaudi 's artwork it is n't as famous as them .
When the Civil War ended , the country was completely destroyed and people had nothing to eat .
Particularly in Barcelona , the trouble was that they could fish on the sea but there was n't an aproppiate place to keep it so they could n't eat one or two days later .
That situation must have been terrible for the population but fortunately , there is always a possible solution .
A group of fishers began to walk around the city looking for a good place where they would have brought their fish .
Finally , they found an old destroyed palace and they decided to build there their own " fish 's shopping centre " .
Neighbours helped them to make the building and after a few months , they began to use it .
This is a great example of how Spanish population could go on with their lives working together without government 's help .
Nowadays , the building has been become a luxury mall with the most expensive brand clothes .
However , the structure has been kept in order to visitors can enjoy this popular architecture 's jewel .
As the story continued people kept thinking that fish were polluted .
The homeless man noticed it too , although he did n't care because he will always obtain free food .
As always after having fish for dinner he had a strange dream .
He was dreaming it was his time to go fishing ; he went so far that he saw a kind of battle between sharks and whales .
He looked down and noticed that there was a city of marine life and the battle was n't really a battle it was a revolution , were the fish where the citizens .
Which meant some of fish were damaged thanks to the revolution , which also meant that while they were reproducing , the genes of the baby were changed .
And the new fish will not be the same conventional fish , they will taste different or simply change its form .
If there were a revolution in the city , obviously the fish would try to escape .
The fish where going to the beach were , the people fished .
That was his entire dream , he was now scared to know if that was real or not .
But it was too illogical to be true ; the good thing was that he was n't the one that would go and fish , which will be the leader .
After a few days of waking and only eating fish , they continued having the same allergic reaction to the fish thanks to their nutrition .
The homeless man had another dream where there was a pest around the forest that was contaminating all types of food .
They will notice quickly because fish will smell worse than it already did .
When he woke up from his dream kind of having a skeptic attitude , but he was diminishing it .
After walking for a lot of days , the ' survivors ' were worried , and thinking of how much they would still need to walk to find a city , also they were thinking that maybe they were going forward one day and backwards the next day .
Which meant they were in the same place , and that was the reason why they would always watch the sea ...
Nowadays , it is more and more popular to take a year off between school and university .
In fact , it is an important decision .
You start live on your own , make your own decisios and plan your future .
It has many advantages and disadvantages as well .
On the one hand , there are a large amount of teenagers who have no idea for their future .
They do n't know which university and field of studying choose .
During a gap year you have the chance to consider all the issues connected with your future .
You have enough time to try to use your capabilities and at the same time discover your own calling .
Besides , there are a great number of people who graduated school but do n't have enough money to continue their education .
The year off gives the apportunities to get a job .
In the beginning it would be a simply and without high wages job but you would get some experience .
What 's more , you can use this time to travel and relax .
You can get to know other countires and new individuals .
On the other hand , I can see also negative aspects of taking a year off .
You start your study later comparatively with your friends .
It would be more difficult to start your own life by oneself .
It is also a point that when you do n't execute what you wanted to during a gap year , you are in the same place when you were graduating school .
To sum up , I think that taking a year off is an important decision you should give it a thought before you finally decide .

Nowadays , television is very important in our lives because there are a lot of benefits and advantages of watching TV .
There are lots of interesting programs suitable for people of every age .
In my opinion TV is useful because we can learn many interesting things and also reduce stress watching TV .
We can choose entertainment programs which are full of fun .
Everyone can choose something suitable for themselves .
We can find music programs which are wonderful for people who love listening to music and dancing .
When we watch and listen to music we can learn foreign languages as well .
The men usually choose sports programs , which are really popular on the TV nowadays .
It is a cheaper way to watch their favourite team than spending money for an expensive ticket .
Who does not like watching movies ?
Everybody loves watching movies !
I work at a gas station .
Today I opened the gas station at 9:30 in the morning .
I went late to the gas station today because I left my keys in the bathroom and I locked myself in the bathroom .
Someone came and opened the bathroom and I got my keys and started to work .
Today I had 2 hours driving session .
Driving instructor picked me at the gas station and from there we went to a parking lot near AMC and practised parallel parking and k - turn .
After that I practiced turns and driving on the road .
The instructor dropped me back to the gas station and from there I took a bus to Princeton and from there I transferred to another bus to my home .
Dear Madam and Sir

My name is Mike , I 'm 23 years old and I want to learn more English because I love this language and because I need it for my next job in the summer .
At the moment I am living in Germany , but if I could come to your English course , then I will find an other location to stay , that 's no problem !
I want to ask some questions about the course .
How much are the costs and how often will we have the course ?
I hope it will be every day because , I wrote that , I 'm looking forward to learn English !
I would be glad , if you could respond to my questions so fast if you can .
If you have any questions , please do n't hesitate to cantact me .
Thank you very much .

Micheal is a clever Shy guy decided to find out new opportunities out of his small town after the tragedy of losing his father , he felt the need of moving forward with his life and discover his real needs , no one in Micheal 's school was able to understand this weird isolated guy , therefore he never accepted having new Friendships out of his class that ends when the class ends , then there was that girl a popular beautiful Blondie that was in the cheer leaders every boy dream , one day after physics exam she just stumbled with his bag and dropped his books out of it , sorry she said with a sad sexy look ! ,
that look who occupied Micheal 's mind then after and lead him dropping his dream of being that creative engineer and abbreviated it all on his muscles and girls hoping that he might be noticed from her , Arika the girl who was using any one can make her reach or cross a step towards her success and popularity , Michael felt that he was pathetic deceived when he saw her with the new class 's clever guy , he could n't understand that giving up man 's dream is the worst decision that will lead to failure , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
We would like to discuss with you the duration of each course unit .
To study 1 unit per week was difficult for us , because of translation .
We were faced with the real problem of lack of time for translating , especially closer to the end when our translators have worked with very large texts .
Whether it would be possible for you to increase the period of one topic studying ? for example 2 weeks for each unit ?
Or 10 days ?
It makes the studying more effective and comfortable for us .
Let me know please .
We 're also waiting for information about you fee , order of payments and other terms of working .
Yours Anna .
I have been playing tennis since I was 5 ! I think it 's a great way to relax and also to do physical exercise .
You can play tennis either in a closed space or outdoor , so you can also play it if it is raining outside .
I do n't like doing a sport in a closed space , such as gyms , in fact , I always do whatever I can to play tennis outdoor though it 's not a beautiful day .
As I said before , I sometimes play tennis in order to relax .
Each time I have a written test at school , I play it the day before .
I find it helps me a lot because it takes my mind off .
If you want to play this sport , I have to make a really big effort and try to train as much as possible .
I reckon it 's a quite expensive sport , but if your parents give you a pocket - money , you will not have any problems .
So , definitely , if you want to try this beautiful experience , I sincerely recommend it to you .

- It 's so hard for me to wake up at 6 o'clock .
Every day I wake up in a very bad mood .
I 'm trying to drink a cup of strong coffee but it does n't help .
Why are you so cheerful in the mornings ?
- I thought that it was your normal condition .
As for me I 've got some rules
- I 'm just late riser person .
That half of my day I always sleepy and angry .
- So it 's not so difficult to be an early riser .
Just follow the day regimen .
And always do some morning exercises .
- Can you show me some of them ?
- I 'm afraid I ca n't .
But you can switch on some special morning tv - shows .
I will send you list of them .
They are very helpful .
- Ok .
And what about your breakfast ?
- I 'm absolutely sure that you need n't drink coffee every morning .
Just a glass of still water and some fruits .
I think you should to consult with a doctor about it .
- Sure . thank you for your advice .
2 . -
Hello , Jane , can I talk to you for a minute ?
- Yes , of course .
What happened ?
Something wrong with you ?
- No , I 'm just want to know your opinion as expert .
I 've got some problems with waking up in the morning
- just follow the day regiment .
Try to not to eat a very substantial meal in evening and in the morning
- What about the coffee ?
- Some experts think that it is good thing .
But I think you must take away it from your ration .
- ok …
- And I forget to add that you must do some morning exercises .
And in a week you will see that it 's not so hard to wake up .
- Thanks a lot for your advice .
Yes , I believe that television entertains and also educates .
Watching quiz programs are a main way to educate oneself .
We get to know about so many facts on a quiz show .
Watching history channel gives us great information about the history of earth .
Watching national geographical or discovery channels takes us into a world of animals where we get to see numerous wild animals and their characteristics which are really interesting .
Daily watching news on television enlightens us on what 's happening around the world .
Being aware of current affairs are important in our life .
There are also many disadvantages of television .
There are plenty of entertainment programs which just consume our time with no other benefits .
It 's really depressing to see kids being engrossed in soap operas or some useless reality shows or cartoons .
Entertainments are a must , everyone should take time off from their busy or hectic schedule .
But it should be in a moderate level .
If everyone uses television wisely , it can do more good than bad .
Estimated USA SUMMER CAMPS department of human resources ,
I am wrtitting this letter as an answer to the job advertisement for working in a summer camp in which I am quite interested . .
I am actually studying a marketing and market research degree at Malaga 's University , in September I will start my last year of course , which I hope to finish next year .
although I am still studying , I also work at weekends as a football referee in the province of Málaga , I consider myself as a person with a high control when I work with big groups and also a person who likes to lead groups and with a good ability to work under pressure .
I am used to work with children who are under 12 years old , because I usually do kids matches when I referee .
the only idea of working in the kitchens it really excites me , because I would like to provide my experience cooking , I started it as an obligation because my parents where always working but finally I liked it , and now I do all sorts of deserts and meals .
Finally , I want to thank you for your attention and I hope to have a future contact soon .
Best regards ,
Dear Mary ,
Thanks for your letter .
I 'm looking forward to your arrival !
I know this is going to be your first visit to Russia and it 's really great ! I 'll give you information about two ways of getting to my place without significant expenses .
The first one is to catch an express bus from the airport to the metro station " Yuzhnaya " and then to change a bus for another one going to my town where I can meet you at the bus station .
The second way is more convenient and comfortable .
I might pick you up from the airport by car .
That would be splendid and fun for both of us because we could have a good long talk and pop into a café for a snack .
As for the weather , it 's quite nice at the moment but I suggest taking something warm just in case as the weather is very changeable here .
Ca n't wait to see you !
Lots of love ,
Svetlana
Dear Mr. Green ,
I have just received your letter and I 'm glad that you have found my film the most interesting .
Thank you !
I 'm really satisfied as there were about 200 competitors and so I would have never thought to be the winner .
I 'd rather go to London and spend a day filming with the film director because I 'm going to take my brother with me and he has never been there .
I think he will be enthusiastic when I tell him the news .
I 'm really sorry , but on May 15th I have an important exam at school , so it would be impossible for me to meet her .
If the film director was available on May 18th , it would be perfect !
Mr. Green , I 'm really keen to know who is the professional film director .
Waiting for your answer .
Best regards
Antonio
The perfect hotel I would love to work should be located in my country .
Particularly , in the south of the country .
Since many European tourists attempt to have their holidays on the beach enjoying the sun shine and also discover the historical remanings from the past , Antalya ( Turkey ) is the best city to work .
So I could take the advantage of my foreign language knowledge .
The hotel should provide variety of cousins from the world , therefore the clients could eat whatever they wish .
There should be both indoor and outdoor pools .
For disable people there should be expanded services to give them easy mobility .
For couples who have babies there should be baby care services .
There should be a bar which is 24 hours opened .
The hotel should have all inclusive concept so before people go for holiday , they could calculate their costs .
In the case of workers , I would like to have accommodation given by the company .
Also the food should be provided from the company .
The most important aspect that the hotel should have , it should be opened whole year , not only in the summer .
So that I do not waste all the money in the winter that I have saved in the summer .
Cyberschool have been attempting to present their new project called cyberschool .
Cyberschool is when students receive
lessons to their computers by their teachers .
This new way of teaching pupils has received a mix response .
Firstly , being at schools with lots of other children in a class develops your social skills , but learning at home , makes you lose contact with others .
When you do the lessons , you have nobody to chat to it about .
Also , staying regularly on the computer is a way to get glasses .
Electronics are bad for our eye .
Some individuals might even become computer addicts due to the time they spend on their PC .
Let 's see .... 6 and a quarter hours of school plus an extra 30 minutes for homework ..... that is 6 and three quarters hours on the computer .
That is more than a quarter of the time in a day !
It 'll be even more if the student plays games or does something else on the PC .
Penultimate , there has been a sudden rise in obesity because of this new project .
Travelling to school at least includes 1 meter of walking , nevertheless staying at home doing work on your PC makes you less active and health .
Schools provide you with healthy food despite the fact we 'll just eat anything we want at home .
Finally , I personally disagree with cyberschol .
It 's unhealthy and dangerous .
Cyberschol are n't interested in health and safety issues !
Now that they are back home , Paulina found out that her mom was in town , so by instinct she decided to go and visit her , as well his brother that has been evading her because she taunted him by being in love with his best friend , they are n't together anymore , but that was such a devastating thing .
Genuinely she knew , that begging him was n't enough , so by going to their old house as a surprise would be at least would give her the chance to confront instead of making a chaos about it , despite this insignificant fraud she knew her mom would be really happy to see her daughter .
She called Jimmy and told him where she was going , but Jimmy did n't answer since he was at work , so she left a voice message .
The condition of the public transport is getting worse day by day .
There are only limited numbers of government buses on the road and their frequency are not good so they get overcrowded .
People board these buses out of compulsion as they have to reach office on time .
On the other hand , metro service is a good medium of transportation , it goes over the road so you do n't get traffic .
The waiting time is minimum , you get a train in every 3 to 5 minutes .
The fare of the metro train is almost equal to the other transport means .
The only flaw of metro service is its unavailability in remote areas .
After a few kilometer , you will find a bus stop but Metro stations are built only in major areas .
So even if you travel through metro , you have to take a bus or auto to reach your destination unless it is located near a metro station .
People who are rich prefer to travel by their own cars as they can take any route and drive as per their convenience .
In public transport many people do n't get a seat and have to stand throughout the journey , it is very exhausting especially in a long journey .
While in a private vehicle you can sit comfortably and enjoy your journey .
If we take out the cost factor , there is not a single reason for anyone to travel through public transport .
Many crimes such as pickpocketing , eve teasing , violence , etc take place in public transport .
It has been an easy target of terrorists to plant bombs , so if you are traveling through a bus , you accept the risk .
Everyone can not afford a car so public transport would be there but in future as well but fewer people will use it .
Recent graduate vs. experienced worker
Our company is a small and based company which works within the same field for almost 50 years .
One of our seniors workers will retire in a month and therefore As I 'm in charge of the Human Resources department has to start the search of a new employee .
Hiring a new employee is not an easy job .
It is a commonly held view that an experienced worker will facilitate the search of .
However , I would like to review another options such hiring a recent graduate from a renowned university .
Any experienced worker would bring a sense of calm , steadiness , wisdom , commitment and experience of course .
He will contribute with his life experience , and he will request for better working conditions as salary , family times , and health insurance .
However , a recent graduate will be avid to accumulate knowledge and fearless of trying a different approach .
In my opinion , recent graduates are ambitious , without prejudices and most of them are not family people as of yet .
Their lifes are focused on their careers .
In conclusion , I would say that a recent graduate would be a great asset for our company as they accomplished our targets .
Nowadays , many young people use more and more social networks to speak to each other .
However , it can have a bad effect on their lives .
What disadvantages does it have ?
Firstly , it is true that they have similar relationships that we could have many years ago .
The only difference is that they use different resources to keep in touch , such as emails and messages , instead of writing letters , which took much time to arrive .
In fact , it ccan help them to speak with their friends more easily .
There is a strong argument for believing these resources can prejudice their writing skills .
While it is true that social networks help shy people to make new friends , it is also true that young people write their messages with abbreviations .
After doing this regularly , they tend to have problems at school because they start to write incorrectly .
There is another problem relates to safety .
Generally , young people do n't have any problem in posting their personal photos on the Internet .
They also publish their conversations on the internet .
But when do this , they expose a lot of details about themselves , details that everyone can see , especially strange people .
In conclusion , I think that social networks can constitute a big problem , especially for people who are not aware of what dangerous there are on the internet .
Dear Ann ,
I 'm so happy to hear you 'll come to visit me !
Now I explain to you , how to reach my home from the airport .
After leaving the airport , you have to take the bus number 14 and you have to get off at the third bus stop .
After you can take the bus , which drives you to Chiari .
In Chiari you have to get off at the train station .
You surely remember that place because the last time you came , you told me that it was the worst train station where you 've never been .
There you 'll find me waiting for you .
In May the weather is usually sunny , but in the evening could be colder than during the day .
If you do n't want to catch a cold , you should bring a jacket and some trousers .
Let me know the exact date of your arrival .
I look forward to seeing you to spend together this month .
Best wishes ,
Emma
Dear Maria ,
I am glad to hear that you are interested in visiting Brazil next summer .
I suggest that you visit a village in the south of Bahia called " Taipus de Fora " .
It is a little village where you can experience a different culture , find local handicrafts , eat good food and enjoy beautiful beaches .
It is a good place to spend your holiday and a perfect place to rest .
Near " Taipus " , you could visit " Barra Grande " , where you can see the sunset at " Ponta do Mutá " and eat seafood overlooking the bay .
Television currently occupies a very important role in entertainment , however , one of the problems that society has faced since television became popular is that it is a distractor in education .
It is believed , there are ways to make TV can help educate .
There are educational programs and channels which transmit good documentaries , but most people prefer other types of programs , such as cartoons , soap operas and soccer matches .
In addition , many of the educational programs are not transmitted by broadcast television and people without cable system , have no access to these .
So the TV could become a useful tool in the educational process if more effort is put into this , from the television programming to the preference of society-
It is argued that whether the government or teachers have the right to determine what subjects should be taught in schools .
In my opinion , although there are some advantages if teachers were responsible for this task , I believe that the government is more suitable to lead this mission .
There are two main advantages of teachers deciding what subjects taught in schools .
Firstly , each teacher would be able to teach courses according to their own expertise , which leading to a more advanced and high - quality teaching .
Secondly , teacher can select subjects that are more useful for local culture .
However , what students learned might be biased to certain aspects .
And it will be difficult for examining students ' ability in a national scale .
Moreover , not all teachers have the ability to design a high - quality course map .
If the decision is made by central authorities , the most obvious advantage is that the estimation for students ' grades could be standardized in the whole country .
For example , a fair grade judging system is essential in an Joint College Entrance Examination .
Although some drawbacks may exist when this task determined by the central authorities , a committee comprising experts in different disciplines can minimize these drawbacks .
In conclusion , while there are advantages and disadvantages for both central authorities and teachers leading this task , I prefer the government to do so .
Nowadays , a lot of people say that friends are the family that you choose .
In my opinion it 's true , however , family is a very important part in your life and you have to take care of it .
On the one hand , friends is like a family because you live together a lot of experiences and adventures .
They are essentials to share secrets or any thing .
It is very important that you choose genuine friends .
It is better to be alone than badly company .
On the other hand , family is very important .
Not only because they than taken at world but also they are always say the truth .
Not only what you want to hear .
They to want better for you , and always they will be by your side .
In conclusion , so family and friends are very necessaris in your life .
It is important to take care every moment at his side .
If you feel love , share it!Every day may be the last .
Both texts contribute different approaches to music industry .
Accordingly , the first one considers if the activity has been affected by file sharing whereas the second analyses the live performance success in the present technological era .
The first text asserts that file sharing benefits new artists and offers listeners a wide choice of styles , despite the fact it is believed that file sharing is detrimental for the music industry .
Additionally , the writer suggests that it has some potential which can be used by CD industry .
The second text assesses the attraction of concerts despite the present high quality of recorded music , and suggests that the reasons to succeed may be the communal experience and its offer of different songs and performances that make the live performance an unforgettable experience .
As a matter of fact , I agree 100% with both texts .
Regarding file sharing , in my view , music industry should adapt to new technologies and habits of users .
On the other hand , personally speaking , I 've always felt amazed by the attraction of concerts over large audiences , thereby in my opinion , the second text offers a good reasons to explain this phenomenon .

My favourite sport
I think my favourite sport is cycling and swimming in summer or spring and skiing in winter .
Why these sports ?
Because I can cycling and swimming almost whenever . I might say in every season .
That 's the main reason I love it .
When it 's cold I always go to a cover swimming pool and when the weather is warm or hot and the sun is shining I always go to a reservoar .
Instead of cycling in winter . I would n't do it because according to my opinion it is quite dangerous .
The roads can be frozen .
And the skiing .
That 's the one of the possibilities which and I can do in winter when I want to be out . Instead of a walk or snowboarding .
But I like it because I go to the mountains with my friends every year and we always have a lot of fun and that 's a great time for each other of us .
I think it has more positives than negatives . I do something for myself because I 'm on the fresh air and I do some activity for my body .
And more , I have an opportunity to meet new people .
Maybe one of my best friends in the future .
On the other hand , I can have a cold and temperature or something like that .
But I can manage it .

2º ADE - TURISMO
Owing a car certainly makes trips faster and easier .
Many drivers regard travelling by car as a future means to travel which helps people save much time .
However , others believe that public transport is better due to the fact that public transport is environmentally friendly .
To my belief , there does exist a promising future for public transport .
It is a known fact that travelling by cars is less green than by public transport .
In the present - day society , sustanable development is of paramount important as our environment is being destroyed on a fast pace .
Using public transport helps save up resources such as fuel and electricity .
If ones insist on travelling by cars , they are , in fact , producing greenhouse gases which are given out by their cars .
It is surely not envirnmentally friendly .
To preserve our environment , taking public transport is a must and a global trend in the future .
All in all , public transport should be an indispensable part of our future plan because we have to protect our beautiful environment . Travelling by cars , although much more convenient , is never a clever choice for the betterment of our future society with the severe environmental issues .
Public transport is still vital part of society and should remain as it is .
If everyone start using car for traveling ; the road wo n't be enough to everyone as there are seven billion people in the world ; and even for environment it is better to use as less as possible .
On top of that , fuel consumption would be too high as we have limited availability of fuel resources .
The government and public body should start thinking about it and to save the society public transport is the best .
Certain age people wo n't be able to drive a car so that they definitely need the public transport .
I can understand the use of public transport is decreasing now a day , but there is still future for it .
Everyone should think about it which is really vital for the society ; and specially the international body should do something about it to motivate people to use public transport as much as possible .
So in summary to save the environment , to make the road accessible to everyone public transport should have been used and we all should try to educate people about the importance of public transport .
Michael was a 25 years boy .
He was very beautiful and many girls wished him to become their boyfriend .
But he did n't want any girls because he loved only Jessica .
Jessica was 21 years old .
She was his neighbour and they love each other from when they were young .
They live in a little town in the Massachusetts .
But one day she decided to take off for Australia to visit some relatives .
He asked Jessica to come with her , but she did n't agree because before marrying him she would try to see if their love could hold out against everything , also the distance .
So she prepared her luggage and she went to say goodbye to him .
He was very angry , so he told her : " if you leave , do n't come back to me , nevermore . "
She was disappointed and try to explain her thought to him , but he did n't want to understand her reasons .
He was afraid to lose her and he did n't want to try to trust her and their love .
" If you think so go away , forever ! " told Michael .
Jessica did n't answer , but she looked at him for the last time while she walked away .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Shopping guide for tourists .
If I were a tourist , I would like to have a great shopping guide with an enormous variety of shops .
This way , I could choose the one which I prefer .
Then , I would make the next recommendation .
Souvenirs store .
When somebody travels , this person wants to never forget the place he has visited .
Then it is very important going to this store and choosing an object that makes you remind the most exciting day of the trip , a gorgeous monument you have seen , ...
Fashion store .
Usually , girls can not spend many days without going shopping and buying some clothes .
These girls could go to an outlet which is near to the art gallery .
There , you can find all the styles of clothes that you can imagine .
Therefore , you will be assessed politely .
Sports store .
This shop is loved by the most sporty people in the town .
If you are like them , it will raise your eyebrows due to the huge variety of sports equipment you will see .
Nevertheless , the sport store is a little expensive .
To sum up , in this town you can find all sorts of shops .
However , these three ones are the most visited by tourists , so they will not disappoint you .
Some people say that are not future for public transport .
They argue that a large number of people prefers travelling in private transport , because it is more comfortable and convenient .
But it is true ?
Travelling by car can give you a certain status quo and make you feel more independent , besides the comfort and convenience .
However I believe the public transport still be very important in our society and has a huge future .
Firstly , travelling by bus or in other public transport,(as underground ) , help us to decrease the emissions of gas , which causes pollution and global warming .
Secondly we all know that the public transport is cheaper than the private transport .
And the last , ( but not the least ) , public transport is muche safe than the private , because it transports much more people , and so , there is more cauttion .
Detoxification , a method people often use to lose weight , has not been proved by the science .
People think that it is a common and effective way , but I believe once there is no scientific evidence , it should not be brought to the weight loss process .
In fact , some people just understand an aspect of this method , that is to say , they have applied wrong method .
Take an example for this , some teenagers drink detox water instead of meals for three or four days in order to lose weight quickly .
However , the way has brought some unexpected results due to their wrong concept .
In fact , some deaths have been caused by bringing detoxification to weight loss process , because they follow the majority without carefully considering .
Generally speaking , the method has not been demonstrated by the scientists , so it is better to avoid it in order not to get some unexpected consequences .
Film stars and politicans are interesting for people because of their talents and special abilities .
Of course , people want to know some facts of personal life of famous people , but often star dont'n like when journalists try to get in their life .
On the one hand , famous people try to hide thier life from journalists .
In the everyday life , the internet has became one of the most important things and it is becoming more and more influental .
On the first hand , I would like to talk about the fact that with the help of the internet we can easily stay in touch with any of our friends .
There are community sites like Facebook , which have a built in messenger .
This messenger can help us to chat with our friends without meeting them .
On the other hand though , people can become anti social , just because of the lack of real face to face meetings .
In the second part , with the internet we can follow the news and current affairs very quickly and we do not have to wait for the news on the television , and we do not have to buy newspapers .
It is more time efficient and in my point of view it is more easier .
However these news can be false .
Last but not least , the internet is for fun .
There are a lot of funny websites which can put you in a good mood .
In conclusion , the internet have pros and cons , but it can be very useful and fun to use .
Gnadenthal is a very small , consisting of almost only one single drivable road village , which is not famous for its size , though .
What is really special about this little village is the Christian brotherhood , living there more than 1000 years .
That probably is the reason why the local circumstances are still similar to the ones of the Middle Ages , exclusive of some infrastructural improvements that made deceases like plaque redundant .
The few houses themselves are set around a very old , Romanesque church , which is bordered by a traditional farmyard for growing sheep and cows .
Nearby , fields with growing vegetables can be visited , which never has been altered by any modern machine but only by the power of hand and cattle .
Gnadenthal is exceptionally suitable for people who want to take some time off their hard and stressful daily life in order to find calmness and to think about themselves in a way of their character .
Since there is no chance for any distractions because of the missing digital infrastructure , any guest will experience a four - day visit the same as a four - week journey in the usual western world .
This enables him to get used to the traditional way of life of a monk .
In addition to the farm work , living in a society of trust in each other is essential for these people .
By conserving this place , the opportunity to gather a great amount of psychological enrichment is conserved , too .
Hi bro , Whats up by there?.I'm going to recommend you to give up from sport , as I told you too many times , sport its bad for health , it makes you to be all day with legs or arms broken or something like this , and the music is improving and stimulating your brain and intelligence .
But also I told you that if you are so good in sports you might get a grant for your studies which will get worth it so I do n't know , in my opinion I would continue with the music if you are good at cause is better for your brain but also sports can relax you and make you disconnect so if I were you I would think about it and compare which of both of them you like more or makes you feel better or relax more or just makes you laughed or have a good time .
Well there is my opinion I will ask some friend about and I will try to write you another letter in a few days to help you more , also if you have another problem , do n't forget to ask me for help please , I will help you in all you want .
See you my Nigga ¡
Nowadays , my favourite sport is running .
Generally , it seems a modest sport or simple hobby , but permit meeting more and more people along the urban streets who make jogging too .
Then you realise that running is a way of life , a healthy way of life .
So , I enjoy running alone or with friends , because this sport have a lot of possibilies , more than I believed when I started to run after finishing High School .
At the beginning , I had a flatmate who loved cycling and running , even in a city like Madrid .
Therefore , we went out at night after university classes and we preferred soft soil paths than pavement .
Later , I have had more roommates , colleagues and partners even who practised this sport , which is among the most fashionable ones at this moment .
Moreover , the races are masser and masser and more and more popular .
But , for the beginners , I would suggest a lot of patience and persistence , and practising with company because running may be bored , tired , dangerous , even , but if you get a strong spirit and will power , you 'll see how you can reduce your physical and mental weaknesses .
Keeping up one 's fitness is an important thing for everyone .
Many kinds of sport which the favourite of mine is Karate .
Karate is not just a sport .
It 's also a teacher in my life .
Karate made me strong and let me know how to face something I scared before .
I enjoyed it and got achievability from it .
Through the train of Karate , I understand myself really .
The train of Karate helps me overcome many difficult things on my learning way .
If you want to try it .
Karate is not a difficult skill sport .
It 's an easy and a good healthy sport .
Just like playing a game .
Opening your mind , do n't be chicken and you 'll find different one about you !
Public Transport with no Future
Even though there have been many efforts to make people use their car less , we have to admit that this battle is already lost .
Since most of these public transport amendments have been remedial rather than something planned foreseeing future problems , they have only been of limited help and , therefore , they have only worked for some time .
This has resulted in only the very in - need people using public transport , and the vast majority of people still use their personal automovile , with the incovemiences and safety being an excuse .
Indeed , using public transport is not only unsafe and uncomfortable , but also unhealthy .
One ca n't imagine how many germs ( virus included ) lay on a hand bar waiting for a skin to rush in .
Only thinking of eat makes me crazy .
So , little by little , and as economic conditions of people improves , public transport will eventually disappear .
At first , I have to admit that I hate any kind of sports , because I know I 'm not good at them .
In the past , I tried to play basketball , tennis , ping pong and so on , but the outcome made me depressed and less confedent .
However , after I came to New Zealand , I found a special sport which does n't need any ability , trekking .
The biggest benefit of trekking is that you can enjoy fantastic view from the summit of mountains .
Also you are able to choose a place to go depend on how you feel .
Especially in New Zealand , there are some beautiful islands and you can get to them by ferry easily .
If you are interested in trekking , you should buy water - proof clothes just in case .
If you do so , You do n't have to be worried about bad weather any more .
Do n't forget to bring some drink as well .
In some place , you will find difficulty in finding it .
To conclude , trekking is one of the most enjoyable sports even for people do n't like sports like me .
Let 's start trekking as soon as possible , otherwise you will miss opportunity to see fabulous scenery .
During the last decades , the number of cars used in big cities has increased steadily . Proportionally , air pollution and deaths associated to traffic accidents have also augmented .
One way to reduce those negative consequences is to foster the use of public transport .
However , there is a great debate on whether this is really a good solution .
Public transport is a more efficient way of using energy .
It moves more people per liter of oil used and contaminates a small fraction of what it would had been if every passenger had traveled using an individual car .
However , public transport lacks some advantages only found when using our own car .
Instead of taking your seat right home , you need to go to a more or less far place in order to take a public transport , and wait for the time it is scheduled to arrive .
The action has to be repeated when you leave the bus or train at the end of your journey .
One thing which we could be sure is that the world is changing but public transport existed in the past and will be in the future .
First point , which I would like to menchioned about is cost .
You need to spend a lot of money when you want to buy it , when you want to insurance it and use it .
Cars are n't cheep and if you think that is easier to move form one place to another when you have a car , you have got a point but there is a lot of considerations which you should occur like : gas , insurance or parking cost .
Moreover , you should recon about comfort during the travel .
When you driving by the car you should be focus on the road , you need to think what could happen , what the other drivers want to do and which way you should chose .
That could be frustrating especialy when you have long road and you need to spend long hours driving .
Finaly , the word conviniend for everyone means something dirrerent .
For one person that would be option yaht you have car which is parked along your road or on your drivway and on any time you could go whenever you want , for the orher that would be pleasur that they coud enjoy the trip without thinking about any car 's issues , They are faitfull that they could meet some new people and take part with others life .
I 'm in the class 4B in Liceo Darwin in Rivoli .
Being there has some advantages and disadvantages .
I can start with saying something about advantages : we are not just classmates but we are friends .
Many of us hang out together during weekends and they have become a group , like me and my other three close friends , but also " best friend " .
We usually meet three times a year all together to eat a pizza in the city center .
Another advantage could be teachers : they are quite strict sometimes but they make us studying harder and this is not so easy to do with teenagers .
But the most important one is that if you are too bored or tired you can look out over a great sight of Turin or mountains from a class ' window .
But there are some disadvantages like stairs because we are at the second floor . We would like to keep fit but we have to use too many strairs to reach our classroom and that 's so annoying sometimes .
We share the floor with another school and it has a different timetable and the bell rings 10 minutes before and it makes me confused but I really like 4B and I would n't change it .
Are they the best invention ? : Cars
At the start of the 20th century , almost no - body had a car .
Nowadays , almost everyone has a car !
But is this a good thing or a bad thing ?
Cars can be useful for several reasons .
Firstly , they allow us to travel fast by road , mostly to the exact place we want to go .
Furthermore , travelling by car is a very comfortable way of transport .
For instance we can use cars radio to listen to some relaxing music , or listen to news while making our way to the place we want to go .
As you may be concerned , cars are very useful but they also have some disadvantages .
Nowadays people are depending on them too much .
Cars are being used even when not necessary .
In addition , cars have been increasing the world carbon emission and that causes the ' Ozone Layer ' to thin down .
Finally , for our car to work , we need to fill them with fuel , which is expensive .
To sum up , cars have advantages but , on the other hand , they can also create problems .
In my opinion , cars are one of the best and most useful inventions .
Unfortunately we should be careful with the way we use them .
Hi Jo ,

Adam was twelve years old , a clever boy in his school , always gets the top marks and participate in most activities , known for all the teachers and students .
He also participated in the school football team and won the state club .
Despite all previous things Adam was alone , has no friends in school or in abbeywood street in Queensland where he lived in Australia and Adam was very annoyed about that and what make it worth a boy called Johnny who had insulted him and Adam did n't want to have a fight with him .
two weeks later , Adam began to make some friends but from his bad luck , they were n't very good friends , they used to make troubles and do n't do their home work in time .the boys were Fernando and Louis in their seventh year in school as Adam .
The math teacher in school Mr Michael was a very good teacher who takes care of children in school .
He realized Adam 's marks are getting low and he involved in some troubles in school and began to investigate him .
In the final exam Mr Michael caught Adam cheating and inform the school 's manager who suspended Adam from all other exams and forced him to repeat the year .
In matter of fact Mr Michael should have provided some advice for Adam when his marks got low but he didn't , and the consequences were very bad so , Michael closed the door and know at that moment he had made a mistake .
I live in big city , the capital of Spain , so there are different transport .
I prefer to use the train or the tube , because they are punctual and because there are a signs where you can see the time less .
Also , every three or four minutes you can get on the train .
There are buses too , but I do not like them . Depend on the dot , there are traffic problems and you must wait a long time in a bus stop .
I am from a small island where only there is a form transport : the bus .
I am from a little town and I must wait one hour to go to the city center .
It is awful if you do not have a private transport .
I propose to use fewer cars .
I know this is not easy but there is an ecological and cheap transport : the bicycle .
For short distance it is a good way to do exercise and to avoid contaminating .
Of course it is not a way for long distance , but step to step , the traffic problems will improve .
For almost the entire duration of " Now you see me " , I was confused .
But let me tell you that I was confused in the best way , not because it was rather wacky but because happenend unexpected .
There 's no question that this film by director Louis Leterrier is the most original and thought - provoking stories I have seen in recent years .
In fact , the box - office hit when it was released and the film went on to gross over 350 million .
The plot revolves around an FBI squad who face , in a game of cat and mouse , a team compounded of the best four illusionists .
They are called " The Four Horsemen " .
They carried out a series of daring robberies against corrupt business leaders during their performances , sharing out the stolen money with their audiences .
As far as the storyline is concerned I have to say that the film is really fast - moving .
Regarding acting , taking into account that it is a big - budget film there is not much to say .
It is fairly well played by actors , such as , Jesse Eisenberg , Morgan Freeman who play their role perfectly , making the film light - hearted .
If I have to stand out any weakness I will say that is a bit predictable .
Let me explain it .
As it is a movie related to magic tricks when a sequence is played and it seems simple and easily understanable you know that , indeed , it is not .
If you do n't like films that make you think , this film is not for you .
On the other hand , if you are looking for a film that is extremely gripping and can keep you guessing , it 's definitely the right choice for you .
We must reduce exam stress from high school students .
Exam stress leads to many bad consequences towards High School Students .
These consequences vary , one example would be that students may get lower grades on their exams , or even fail them .
They can also have constant mood changes and high levels of nervousness , since they may have lost many hours of sleep whilst studying for a certain exam .
As a result , many High School Students may not concentrate during classes , or whilst studying since they have many things on going through their heads ( since they 've been studying a lot ) .
Based on all the problems listed ( and many more ) , we must find solutions that will help both students and professors to deal with exam stress .
One of the solutions I would give is to hand in study guides to the students .
This will help them as a method to study or review for the exam and reduce their levels of stress .
The study guide does n't need to necessarily be a long and complex one ( since those may cause them stress too ) ; they may be just a quick review with a couple of concepts and exercises .
Another simple solution I think could help is to study as well as to review content during sessions before a certain exam , to help the students study whilst still having a class .
The previous are the best possible solutions I would address in order to stop once and for all the problem of stress thanks to exams , in which most of the cases , as the previous paragraph explained , leads to many more .
When I was a child I used to spend thousands hours playing football , anywhere I could .
Always dreaming becoming a great player , playing in a stadium crowded , clapping their hands looking at what I did with the ball .
When I grew up I realize sooner than later , that I will never be nor a good neither a bad player , and they said that I was one of the worst players ever lived .
Then I decided to study engineering and becoming one the best engineers ever .
Long after that due such I was a natural talent about engeneering , I began to write books and essays about everything realted with my job .
Life becoming bigger more and more .
Today you need more than what you needed yesterday .
People looking for comfortable easy life .
We are all looking for that without great difficulty or effort and one way to achieve this goal is to study abroad .
Many students today like to study abroad to get high level of life to get their life job and experience a new way of life .
Studying abroad can enhance employment opportunities .
companies are looking for well educated people with a good experience to hire and students more likely to fit their choices .
With your certificate you can easily fine a job .
Universities are also a rich place for big opportunity to get there if you have studied abroad .
You can work at a university as a lecturer and get a high salary .
Students who go to study in another country experience a variety of life .
They meet new people and make friends with students from different countries .
Try new food in completely different places .
They can explore cities in weekends or academic breaks .
Learn how to do everything by themselves and become independent .
To sum up , studying abroad is a great chance to get a great job as you have higher education with much more experiences .
Moreover , you can learn many things and expand your knowledge , have friends from different backgrounds .
Dear Paco ,
Hi !
How are you ?
Do you remember our arrangement ?
InBy February we 'll have finished our exams and we 'll have more free time .
For that reason we 're going to putting our name down at the gym and the swimming - pool .
Furthermore , on Tuesday and on Friday we wo n't have class and we will be able to go running and cycling .
Besides I 've a big surprise , apart from remembering our agreement , my father is taking up hiking with his friends and he has offered us to join in .
What do you think ? We could go on Sunday morning .
Nevertheless , what about having lunch on Saturday and speak it quietly ?
Answer me soon
Best wishes

Dear editor
I 'm writing in response to the announcement in International Sports Monthly .
I would like to say that my favourite sport is birdwatching .
I know that this is something strange but I really enjoy it .
To begin with I am interested in birdwatching because from when I was young and I want to be a biologist when I grow up .
Birdwathcing really relax me and bring me closer to the nature .
Furthermore I enjoy being able to recognise the different species of birds .
If someone wants to start birdwatching , I think he should be interested in birdwatching first .
This means that if he does n't like it , he will definitely give up immediately .
So if someone really want to birdwatch , he should first know what species of birds there are in the area that he lives .
Then he should buy a pair of binoculars or a telescope .
To sum up I believe birdwatching is a really exciting sport but you must like it to start it .
Sports or hobbies could be great options like new activities in order to plan in my college , however I believe there are others which could be provided for us and it would be interesting to take part in .
Do n't you know to say in the presence of a huge audence ?
Are you nervous when you have to speak on public ?
The new activity which I have thought it could be organised and it could have success is called " The Club of dicussion " .
It let us improving our hearing and speaking skills .
In addition , it could be interesting although you do n't have to do physical actitivy , because of your capacity to redaction a speech , support an idea , have a connected speech will be got better in this kind of activity .
What 's more , it does n't require a specific place to take place in , it could be trying anywhere .
I think that the allure of this activity is you can meet a lot of people and share with them that experiences .
Moreover , I think that it should become a reality because the field of the activity is so broaden and it could be useful in other plenty scope even in your daily routine .
In conclusion , making a speech contributes on our social relasionships and it allows us to define our personality .
I think that my college must provide an activity which is focused on the social abilities and it teaches you how you must speak in front of a multitude , and why not could be this ?
Dear Lucky ,
Thanks for your last letter .
I am glad to understood that everything is OK about you .
I am very grateful that you will help me with searching some information about colleges in England .
Actually , I am interested in science , especially area between chemistry and physics .
Also , it will be interesting for me tuition , which refers to biology and influence in different kind of chemical compounds over the human body .
You know that I had learnt biotechnology at school in Bulgaria .
Please , check for me , which colleges provide these subjects and when they start .
I want to know if it is available a grant .
If so , what is the criteria for giving it .
Last , but not least , what is the fee ? I want to find a college , which is not so expensive .
Thanks a lot for your support !
Write to me as soon as possible .
Best wishes ,
Niki

Customer satisfaction is much great when he gets service which has value or quality much greater than he expected .
If service meets only the expectation and does not provide anything more than it , means customer satisfaction is there but customer would not feel great .
If service is not meeting expectation of the customer or its quality just below expected , it causes customer dissatisfaction .
This will result in consequences such as negative feedback .
In this context it can be concluded that 78% of the respondents are satisfied with both the customer services of builders and results of Vasthu .
Rest of the respondents have positive feedback .
The factors which hinders other respondents from giving very positive feedback may be either dissatisfaction caused by customer service or failure of meeting results of vasthu to their expectations .
I like watching movies a lot .
It is one of my favourite free time activities .
I like all kinds of movies . Comedies always make me laugh and I like it .
Also , I rest from the routine while watching it . I can relax and just watch , laugh and talk to my friends .
Another reason why I like comedies , there is a wide variety of this kind if movies .
You can choose what you want to watch .
Personally I , watch a comedy movie almost every evening .
It makes my mood better and I fall asleep while watching it .
I respond to the article " White House calls for ' genuine choice ' in Hong Kong elections after petition attracts 200,000 signatures " on SCMP .
I feel sad and angry to know that 200,000 Hong Kong people support this website .
They are short sighted and seems that they are brain - washed by radical democracy thoughts .
People who signed in the website were colluding foreign powers to suppress our own country , China .
I think this is traitors ' action .
They do not have basic loyalty to their own country .
Using foreign powers to threaten China is a kind of unwise act .
Hong Kongers , being a Chinese , should not inhibit our own country , with other countries .
In fact , china will not be moved by this , and this will aggravate the contradiction between Hong Kong , China and the US .
China has the power and freedom to decide the way to settle the dispute .
The US and other countries should not disrupt it .
It is better not to interfere the internal political affairs when they do not know lots about China 's politic conditions .
The US is really a busybody .
As we all know , Occupying Central is illegal .
The US is supporting this illegal activity indirectly .
The US always keep " rule by law " as their catchphrase , but Occupying Central is betraying the Hong Kong law .
So it is very strange for US to say " rule by law " when they support Occupying Central .
In Occupying the Wall Street , the US did not seems to be much more peaceful than Tiananmen Massacre .
According to Wiki encyclopedia , FBI called the occupier as " terrorist " and decided to suppress the dispute as settling terrorist attack .
So the US has no qualification to criticize China .
Apart from this , the president election in the US is full of unfairness .
I do not know if there is filter for president candidates , I just know that the ballots are counted in states .
There are different number of residents in different states , but it uses the states to represent the residents . I do not think the election is fair enough for the US to ask for " real democracy " for Hong Kong .
Is the US really target to get Hong Kong into a democracy area ?
I think not , but a democracy " country " .
After Hong Kong gets " real democracy " , the US will drive Hong Kong to be independent .
The US always target on dividing China into many small , weak countries , then it can break up a competitor of itself .
And it can even occupy the broken China to get interest in it .
Let us see counties that the US introduced " democracy " to it .
Egypt , Iraq , Libya , Syria , there were chaos for " democracy " everywhere , and the next , might be Hong Kong .
I am afraid that Occupying Central would lead to chaos that similar to Tunisian Revolution .
The signature collection of the White House now ended .
China has not take any further action .
I really hope Hong Kongers that signed in the website could think again what they were doing and how harmful it is to China .
And I really think the US could stop picking on China .
Learning many ideas and knowing detailed facts both are considered crucial for students education .
Some people think that knowing fact is more easily and practicable .
Nevertheless , others consider learning ideas and concept is the best way to confront many academic and real - life problems .
In my view , l completely agree with the idea that it is important to students to learn idea and concept than learn facts .
I would like to explain my reasons .
First , learning facts can help students to solve one kind of problems that they may face .
However , ideas and concepts give people competitive edge in dealing with other similar issues .
For example , once I do n't grasp an idea that my teacher have explained in class , but just remember facts .
When I do my homework , I find the problem is different than the case discussed in the class .
While , I go back to my textbook and try to realize ideas and concepts .
I work out the problem easily .
From this experience , I learn that I do not just remember facts , but try my best to understand ideas and concept .
thus , I can solve many kinds of problem simply .
Second , learning ideas and concepts support self - education greatly .
Consequently , you can reach high academic levels .
It is easy to know facts from people around you .
However , learning ideas and concepts need more investigation and understanding many of the academic textbooks . .
Nowadays , there are limited time for any teacher to cover all point in a certain subject .
When , students catch the idea of any topic it will be easy to understand all issue related to it deeply .
For instance , when I was in senior year in high school .
I took physics class .
It was massive materials on a specific issue , but I attempted my best to catch its notion that made me recognize any unmentioned points .
In sum , absorbing ideas and facts is the most effective strategy .
Not only do student learn more in their studying , but also they help students understanding many facts in our life better than any other ways .
If you ask me , who is the person who I admire the most ?
I would say you are talking about my father .
He is so brilliant , he speaks three languages , plays several instruments , and the most important of all , he is a man of remarkable principles .
When he was younger , he worked to the government but he had to quit because of the corruption .
He always wanted to have his own business , he used to say , if you work for somebody you are part of the problem , but if you hire people to work for you , you are part of the solution , so if you want to be successful , be your own boss .
He travelled a lot , he knows Barcelona , London , Paris , Stockholm , Miami and so many places .
He taught me my basic English , to playing tennis , to play the guitar , to dance , to sing and I can continue counting .
So , if I can end my days , been a little bit like him , the work will be finished and I could say I have been a good father just like him .
When I try to create in dreams , the home of the future the first thing , which I have in mind is new technology . in my opinion , homes in the future have to be different , this is connected with our society and development .
To begin with , I consider that many of homes , which will be create in the future must have robots .
A lot of them .
They are designed to doing all things related to housework .
In general houses could have open space , a lot of windows and light everywhere .
And one of the most important thing for me , new homes should fly in the sky .
In my opinion , inside they will be looks still in the same way , maybe more technology connected with new inventions .
One of the most impressive solution will be swimming pool in the sky , near area .
All in all , future houses will be looking more like airplane , and less like normal home .
They will be more comfortable and useful for our community .
It was a sunny day and I was with my friends at the beach .
Because it was our first day at Algarve , we decided to explore , a bit more of the area .
We picked up our things and start to walk .
The first thing to visit , according to the plane , was the Albufeira center .
We find a very cosy and traditional houses , the market was very populary , with a lot of people walking around , and the people were very nice to us .
The next place was a restaurant near the beach .
Near the restaurant we saw a very strange thing .
We saw a boy drawing my face , but I never saw that boy in my all life .
We decided to go talking with him .
He started being nervous when we question where he saw that girl .
He sad that girl , that he was drawing , is the most beautiful girl that he ever met in his whole life .
He explain that he saw that girls in the beach .
When we saw me in front of him , he immediately invited me to dinner with him .
Because I never heard beautiful words like that about me , I accepted the invitation without thinking .
When the night comes I went to the restaurant that he invited me to go .
I was dressing a short red dress and a black shoes .
The boy , Ruben , was wearing a shirt with a brown trousers .
The dinner was amazing .
Since then we have been in touch and by now we are dating . I think this is extraordinary .
Ruben is a very cute guy and I do not want to lose him never .
When I was younger , I did n't like any sport .
I tried with swimming , and I was found that so boring .
After that , I sign up into Karate classes but I did n't like combat sports like this .
But one day , my sport teacher gave me the opportunity to became a basketball player with nine years old .
Since that day , basketball became as my favourite sport .
The main reason which makes me love it , maybe that 's the teamwork , the feeling of unity when you 're in a big team and the sound of the net when the ball goes into the basket , it makes you go to the seven heaven .
That 's for sure .
You would like to become a basketball player too ?
All right , I 'm going to give you some advice .
If I were you , I would remember always a tip of Michael Jordan . "
A player could win a game , but only a team could win championships " .
If you remember that , and understand it , you will become a great basketball player .
I 'm sure .
All of us are surrounded of plastic , plastic is needed in our everyday life for a lot of things .
For this reason when a woman and her family decided to live a whole month without plastic they had to change treir live style .
Nowadays there are a lot of products which have plastic or they are wrapped in plastic so it could be difficult to live a whole month without it .
However this family believed that if they arrived their goal , they would reduce the amount of plastic rubbish .
So they would help to stop a bit the problem fot the UK 's recycling system .
This family says that they had to change their diet too , because of some of their usual food .
Such us yoghorts , biscuits , etc was wrapped in plastic .
So I think that from my point of view it could be difficult to follow this life style much more than a couple of months .
There are a lot of products or food , which are needed in our life , and they are match with plastic .
However I also think that it 's important to be concient with the environmental concernts , so some ideas like this could be good to reduce the rubbish .
To sum up I think that it 's important to know that we should recycle plastic as well as carton , glass , etc .
In order to do n't waste energy .
So we can use the plastic in a responsible way but we have to know that we should n't follow this idea until the extreme because we need plastic .
Witness
Sitting here alone , six floors up on my little balcony , when I heard shots and saw boys running .
The first thing I thought was that there was a CONFLICT between someone .
And then , I saw something black not moving in the LANDSCAPE of the woods .
I knew a body was lying there and knew it was dead .
A 15-year - old boy , the papers said .
A Bunch of sirens , cops and spinning lights were down there .
I watched till they DRAG him away , and then everything got quiet again as it there was nobody , so I 'm sure the cops will ENFORCE the guy who did this .
I did n't see them till next morning .
I 'm looking down at those woods .
A couple 's coming slow on Frankstown with a girl by the hand , had to be the boy 's baby sister .
They pass through Mason 's bar and stop exactly next to the spot the boy died .
How do they know .
Then they started to put and REWARD flowers were the boy died .
How do these people find the spot .
Could they hear my old mind working to guide them , lead them and TREND them and get up out this damn wheelchair and take them by the hand .
But I was in POVERTY , so I could not go and take them .
The guy who killed that boy really need to have a INCENTIVE to kill him .
That was an unfair death .
If there was a machine that can go REVERSE in the time , I might could save him .
But , unfortunately , were not in the future .
The other benefit of living abroad is an incredible personal experiences .
When you meet unique people with amazing stories .
For example , you may meet someone who has travelled nonstop for 20 countries and visited most of the countries on the plants .
Therefore , this experience opens you up to different ways of viewing the world which may alter the rest of your life .In addition , it gives your children a much better understanding of other culture when they attend international schools .
This results in it will change their lives and expand their prospects in the future .
Hello Jo
Congratulations !
You 're very lucky because you have free time to travel and work abroad .
I hope you have had a high score at the school .
My country , Spain , has a lot of beautiful cities and places to visit .
If you like mountain , you could start your travel on the North , a region called Asturias .
There is a well - known mountain , Lagos de Covadonga .
You could spend some time walking and visiting the region .
There are good meals and drinks : " fabada " ( with beans ) and " sidra " ( it looks apple juice ) .
Near the mountain ( about 20 kilometres ) you can find beaches , but I recommend the beaches on the South , Andalusia .
There are many kilometres of coast and there are a lot of sites and parties to enjoy all the time .
If you come here on February , you will enjoy a lot in Cadiz with the carnival .
If you come on Spring , you have to visit Seville , and you will enjoy the Easter Week and the Feria week .
Travelling in Spain is easy .
You have many roads , motorways , so you can rent a car and travel by yourself , without table - fixed times .
Despite , if you dislike driving , you can use public transport : long distance trains , buses , etc .
At the end , to look for a job , I think the best option is Madrid , which is the capital city , and there you will find a job easily .
I hope you enjoy your travel and see you soon .

Not differently of much of the world sports lovers , I 'm sick about Football !
Not just a really competitive game ; Football is a full mix of art , creativity , dedication , hard work and team cooperation .
Even if you are the best player in the whole world , you have always to play for your team - or else , be ready to be overcame by your foe !
When a very skilled player finds himself in a hostile work environment ( with talented but selfish players who are n't committed to their " team play " ) he tends to lose performance and lack good results in matches .
Sometimes , the real spectacle does n't take place in the fields , but in its surrounds !
Supporters of traditional clubs can be very passionate .
Usually , when facing tough opponents or decisive matches , they turn the stadium in a really large party in order to intimidate the adversaries ; coloring the benches with flags and jerseys - sometimes building wondrous mosaics to express their delight .
If someone asks me what is the most important thing to start practicing ( or even following ) this terrific sport , I 'd say it 's the passion in wearing your club 's jersey and the respect towards your adversaries ' .
Every country has got its own history .
For years of wars and difficult situations the history was creating people 's beliefs and convintions .
It was creating a culture .
People were building new castles , palaces and churches .
Yes - churches .
I think religion means a lot for people- especially polish people .
I want to describe a story of the Monastery of Częstochowa .
Its a city in Poland strongly connected with a dramatichistory of our country .
The monastery is situated on a hill .
The icon , depicting the Mother of God with the Christ Child , known as the Black Madonna of Częstochowa was imported from Russia in 1384.And since then a lot of pilgrims has been visiting that picture .
Some people probably think - there is not anything special- usual picture .
But in the 17th century there happened a miracle .
Polish people had to defend Częstochowa and rescue their countryBut the polish resistance was smaller and smaller .
Immediately the fighters of Sweden began to stop attacking a hill .
Polish soldiers managed to repulse them .
In 1656 polish king John II Casmir made Lwów Oath .
He promised that the Madonna of Częstochowa will always be a polish queen .
I think it is a perfect example of an important historical place in my country .
I think everybody who lives in Poland must go to Częstochowa .
When you were a child have you ever asked what are you able in ?
Or were you sure about your favourite sport ?
What are the sports you usually do ?
But , most of all , do you enjoy them ?
Athletes are extremely strong , probably they might fall in love with a sport at the first sight .
On one hand we have the people who lives on their sport , on the other hand there are ones who do any sport , indifferently , because it is just a way to lose weight or a way to spend their free time .
Unfortunately , I have not a favourite sport , although I 'd like to .
I just go to the gym twice a week to attend a course and I swear I have never sweated more .
It is likely you would have got more self - confidence if you had worked harder during a course .
So , for the unlucky ones like me , my suggestion is If you did not fall in love with any sport , you should try a course ! You will surely feel better and more relaxed after that .
Places to enjoy
The aim of this report is to give advice about the best places for the young people in my home town .
Cultural visits
Tarragona is an interesting and beautiful place for spending your time .
You can visit museums , roman monuments and also the cathedral .
TArragona is near Barcelona .
It is an important city and there are a lot of attractions .
You can go by train , by bus o maybe to rent a car .
Restaurants and clubs
You should go to the restaurants located in the harbour of Tarragona .
All of them are based on the typical Mediterranean cuisine .
Mirabel , Aquamar and Siroco are the trendy restaurants .
They are very comfortable and cosy and a good price .
YOu could go to clubbing in Tarragona but if you travel in summer it is worth the effort go to Salou .
It 's a village close to Tarragona .
AT night has a special atmosphere .
Relax
The best option to relax is to be lying on the beach .
Watching the Mediterranean sea .
Conclusions and recommendatios
Tarragona and surroundings are a good place to visit and to know their culture .
Everybody can be a good teacher for younger people .
In my opinion , parents are the same and they can be great teachers for their children .
Several reasons can support this idea , but I try to focus on the most important ones .
First , Parents are a great source of experience which can be helpful in teaching .
Secondly , they have a close relationship with their children , which results by feelings and emotions .
These two reasons may be enough for every child to consider his / her parents as valuable teachers .
As mentioned earlier , Experience is a prerequisite for every teacher .
In this respect , parents have so many things to teach to their children .
They have faced with different events in their lives and every event has had many lessons for them .
It does n't matter that they have failed or gained success on those events , the important thing is the experiences they have got from those events .
In this point of view , children can always ask their parents to teach them some new lessons from the large source of infinite experiences .
I myself , have faced with so many cases that helped me to understand the teaching ability of my parents .
Once I was 18 years old , I had to make an important decision about my university major .
So I just made a quick decision based on some research on the internet and some personal favorites and priorities .
I was hoping that , my decision was the right one , but it was n't actually . I had chosen electronic but my parents told me to have some more research and consultations with the graduates of different majors including electronic .
I did their recommendations and I totally changed my idea .
There were some aspects that I was really unaware of them .
So by considering different ideas and opinions , finally I chose computer engineering as my university major .
Now I am graduated in this major and I am really satisfied with that .
So , Parents ' experiences can make them strong teachers for their children .
Parents ' closeness to their children can be another reason that makes them good teachers .
They are really close to their children in the terms of feelings and emotional matters .
They have a strong familiarity about favorites , skills , talents and all other valuable information related to their children .
Regarding this information , they can teach their children and help them to make reasonable decisions .
I remember once in high school I had to make new friends and I was dubious about my situation and it was a great dilemma to choose the best ones .
So I came to my parents and asked their help , they presented the best recommendations for making the decision , then I could make the best friends that I can easily go along with .
I am really satisfied by my parents as my indisputable teachers .
they have really saved my lives in different cases .
So parents can be the best teachers regarding their emotional closeness to their children .
All in all , parents are a great source of experience , which can help them to be good teachers .
Also they have so many close relationships with their children , which makes them a trustworthy characters as teachers .
I hope a day that all the children rely on their parents as their teachers .
what I usually do in my free time .
I really like reading many kinds of books , magazine , etc.when the weather is bad , I love sitting in my favorite armchaire , near the fire place and reading .
I enioy to hear the rain while I am reading at home ...
Howhever I like very much walking too .
When the weather is good I often go out with my friend for a walk in the countryside or do shopping .
I also love watching films at the cinema or on tv .
I prefer comedy and romance , but I like triller and drama too .
At least I enioy to take care on my garden , where there are many flowerbeds with a lot of kinds of flowers .
Dear Laura ,
I am glad to hear you and know you have bought a new computer game .
Actually I do n't like very much the computer games , because in my opinion they are so boring!I also think these games get a sort of dependency , like the alcohol or the drugs , so they can be very dangerous !
I really prefer doing other kind of things on my computer , like to surf the Internet , to study English , etc .
For example I use my computer to prepare exercises for my students or to look for funny and useful laboratory 's experiences of chemistry .
See you soon .
Kisses .
Sara
A terrible holiday
Last year I decided to go on holiday with my friends .
We like very much the sea , so we looked to rent a little cottage on August at a lovely place in Sardegna .
We arrived at the island in the morning , after a long journey on a ferryboat .
Then we got on a bus to arrive at the house which we had rented .
The cottage was really fine , with a fantastic view of the beach .
I looked forward to go on the beach and to swim in that wonderful wather .
But the lucky was n't with me !
In fact I was ill all the time and I only could look the sea through the window of my room !
Dear Jeanny ,
I am always glad to receive your letter !
My favourite TV programme is Quark .
This is a documentary about the science .
I like watching it because in this programme I can get a lot of information .
For example I can know about the Big Bang , the origin of the universe , it 's fascinating !
I can also look about the astronomy , the fisic , the chemistry , the biology and many other range of the science .
In this programme I can have information about the last scientific discovery and the
technological development .
In my opinion it is one of the most interesting programme about the science on TV .
A kiss .

What did you understand about the job advertisement ?
This is a job about all the information material on a cruse , and media manager works with other managers on a cruise .
Every day you heave new news about cruise , excursion , weather and many other information about cruise .
If you want information early morning , we well can get newspapers in your cabin .
Media manager follow information on panel , change information depending on weather , trip and many other information .
What happens if you change the route on a cruise ?
You can change all the information on a cruise and inform passengers about the plan change for the cruise .
To take care of our bodies , we eat well , exercise and make sure to get enough sleep .
We also have to take in mind taking care of our environment , in order to have a healthy life .
In my town we protect the Environment Around us :
By recycling , by tryng to reduce the transit , walking and cycling , that also impruves our health and fitness .
People from all eages must help to clean up the city and protect the wildlife .
At school , children had been tauhgt about how to do an apropiated use of the electric energy .
there are many people that offered themselves as volunteers to clean the city , and had been very helpful to make the city cleaner and more attractive .
There also a lot of plans for the futre , in order to start using electric cars .
The title of one of the best thriller movies I have ever seen is " Seven " .
" Seven " is a story about a psychopathic serial killer , who kills on behalf morality and ethics .
In particular , the killer kills seven people each one corresponding to those - that according to the Christian religion , are the seven deadly sins .
All the murders show characteristics reflecting a specific deadly sin .
That provides , especially to one of the two detectives who are investigating about the crimes , a trace to follow in their investigation .
In the movies are some references to the Dante 's " Divina Commedia " Italian poem as well as to the Bible .
The film is excellent because of both a very exciting and engaging plot , and great interpretation of the main characters - the serial killer and the two detectives .
To my mind , shopping has both believers and opponents .
The first one claim that shopping is a big pleasure and fun .
The second do n't agree with them .
In my opinion shopping is not always enjoyable .
Many times when I was on shopping , I was unhappy or disappointed for different reasons .
First of all , we can like or even love shopping , but not always we have have enough money to buy items we want or need .
It 's nice go through shops and take leave with hands full of bags .
Unfortunately , we realize at home , that our wallet is empty .
That makes us sad .
What is more , shopping may affect our mood or even body in a bad way .
When it comes to bargain sale , on such period people start to behave like animals and rarely think reasonable .
They walk very quickly , even run to get the last thing which is left on the store .
They sometimes almost fight for it .
It 's really dangerous .
All in all , shopping in it 's intention is an enjoyable action which often makes us feel happy about it .
Nevertheless , some people treat shopping too seriously and as a result become addicted to it .
To whom it may concern .
Hi to everyone ,
My name is Daniela and I 'm eighteen years hold .
I 'd like to present my application because I think I 'm the right person that you are looking for the job described in your advertisement .
I speak both well English and French and I 'll be free all the summer until the end of October because I 've just finished High school .
There , over the last two years , I 've been a Leader of a group which was involved in the organisation of Courses for young students with learning problems .
At the same time I was one of the leader in the " Scouts " , so I 've learned a lot how to come together with people and to take care of them .
I was in the school swimming team and I 've got the first - aid certificate .
I 'm chatolic and I play the guitar in the Church 's choir .
Each years , in the summer holiday I 've worked in the " Summer camp " organised in our neighboorhood both helping in the kitchens and organising sports and various activities for children between 6 and 13 years hold .
Carefully , your Daniela
In the wonderful world of cooking that we live where we have a lot of products and chefs so good , I would want to visit an Italian restaurant because I love cheese and I think that Italy is the best place where you can eat a different types of cheese in the world .
The perfect atmosphere for me is a modern build that it has different rooms with different styles : modern , classic , gotic , etc .
When I eat in a restaurant I hate two things : people smoking and the high level of voice of the people .
Whereas , I love two things too : a friendly waitress with her traditional black clothes and a light on my table that make the night more romantic if you dinner with your couple or more relaxed if you dinner with your friend .
I think that an Italian restaurant is a great place for my class because there they can choose between different fantastic dishes for example : pasta , pizza , seafood or pork .
Besides , they can drink many wines .
However , not all it is ok , a trip to Italy is so expensive and many clasmates ca n't go it .
I enjoyed the time off from the University .
My time off from the University is significant to my personal development .
learning can also take place outside the University campus .
As such , we develop through interacting with their environment .
While on holidays from the University .
I travelled to my country of birth where I was able to meet my family member , relative and friends .
I was able to inspire some members of my family to send their children to University .
I told my friends and family members the importance of University Education to our community .
I visited many interesting places i.e. nature reserve , historical places , zoo , rivers etc .
Also during this period , I was involved in a local community project to build community hospital . while on this project , I interact and shared ideas with other professionals on the project .
While on the time off from the University .
I took a part - time employment with the local housing company .
This part - time job gives me the learning opportunity to develop my skills and understand the practical aspect of my career .
This practical experience gave me the opportunity to understand the importance of supervision .
I enjoyed the monetary values of this job .
I earn some money to pay my University fee and rent for three months . I also received a very good reference from the firm which was passed on to the University .
They would like to offer me another opportunity for work placement on my final year at the University .
Good Morning !
I 'm Mary and I 'm writing you a letter because I would like to work in your summer camp .
I live in Milan with my parents but I 'll move to the USA before the end of spring so I would like to find a job there to make some money .
My parents are both English native speakers but to learn more about the culture I studied languages at the university and now I 'm graduated in English and French so this job is also an opportunity for me to improve my English in another state and not only with my parents and family .
In Italy I worked as a babysitter for a couple of months , I took care of 3 kids : 1 child is 7 years old and the others 2 children are both 11 years old and back then I had to cook for them lunch and dinner .
At the university I was part of the football team and we won the championship against one of the most athletic football team in our country .

Thank you for your time !
Bright future for public transport
The convenience of travelling by cars benefits the majorities of us in a modern society .
It is efficient and private .
Car manufactures desperately seeking new technologies to improve the features of a car .
By making it more modern , powerful and economic , they have successfully attracted more customers than ever .
In Canada , the vehicles per capita is 60.7% in 2001[1 ] .
There was once an interest saying that North America are the nations on wheels .
Car has brought the epic change to our lifestyle .
We depend on cars so much as if they are our spare pair of foot .
As result , the rapid increasing of cars on the road brought negative consequences .
Firstly , vehicle 's emissions can cause detrimental effects on the environment in many ways .
Such as global warming , soil and water pollution and acid rain .
Secondly , vehicles contain many different fluids , including motor oil , antifreeze , gasoline , air - conditioning refrigerants , and brake , transmission , hydraulic and windshield - wiper fluids .
In most cases , these fluids are toxic to humans and animals , and can pollute waterways if they leak from a vehicle or are disposed incorrectly .
In addition , traffic congestion has become another worsen problem .
It spread massively in much of the world and has many negative impacts of all aspects .
In 2010 , a recurring massive traffic jam that happened in China caught worldwide media 's attention .
The traffic Jam slowed down thousands of vehicles for more than 100 kilometres and lasted for more than ten days .
Many drivers were able to move their vehicles only 1 km per day , and some drivers reported being stuck in the traffic jam for five days .
It is considered to be one of the longest traffic jams by some media .
On the other hand , modern public transport has been improved progressively in the past decade .
Its comfortable , efficient and economic features have been attracting more young professional .
By taking a subway , you will be able to guarantee your arrival time for a class or an important meeting ; In some big cities , public transport plays a big role in a modern society . with great coverages and efficient routes ,
subway has become the most popular commute tool .
For instance , in New York , the subway system contains 232 miles of routes .
In 2013 , the subway delivered over 1.71 billion rides , averaging approximately 5.5 million rides on weekdays.[2 ] Shanghai Metro system are 14 metro lines and 329 stations , with an operating route length of 334 miles , with 2.5 billion rides delivered in 2013 .
On a normal weekday over 8 million people use the Shanghai Metro.[3 ]
In addition to the convenience of public transport , the fare is much cheaper compare of driving a car .
Some professional companies even offer their employees free public transport pass as a benefit .
The public transport in my city is very convenient .
Even though our subway system is still developing , the main line that pass through downtown , several universities and popular city spots is very popular and has been many tourist , students and professionals 's prior choice for commute .
There are some park and ride stations allowed car drivers to connect with the subway , It is very convenient and encouraged more people to drive less .
If I have to get to somewhere on time in rush hour , I will first consider the subway over drive a car .
Eco - friendly awareness has positively affected young generations .
Taking subway to work has become a trend and all the changes that happening today will sure lead a bright future to public transport .

I think it could be a good idea to try the restaurant " The old clock " .
The restaurant is charming and fascinating , located in the old town 's center .
It 's an ancient brewery which keeps a particular atmosphere .
The menu in not really wide - this is good in my opinion , because I 'm quite suspicious of the restaurants offering too many dishes ... The restaurant serves fresh food only , depending on the season 's products .
There is also a good choice of food for vegetarians , so Mike and Ann will have not a problem to eat .
The downside could be the waiting time to eat , because all the dishes are prepared at the time of the customers do the order .
But it 's a guarantee for the client : the food is great indeed !
The location is informal and the service is good , the owner and the waiters are friendly , you feel at home .
You can listen live music or a DJ on Friday evening , it 's really fun !
Last but not least , the price is good , especially compared with the quality of food and service .
As the concert finished , I heard someone call my name .
A man put a small envelope in my hand and went away .
I opened it and I could see a common C D inside .
When I got home , I played the CD on the CD player but it really was n't any sound !
At that moment the phone started to ring , I pick it up ... but no one answeared me when I asked ' Who is that ? ' .
I was beginning to get very nervous when somebody Knocked the door .
I opened it but there was nobody there !
Suddenly a loud noise was heard in the room and I woke up .
I was lying on the couch with a mystery novel in my hands!. It had all been just a nightmare!.
All over the world , the number of overweight people is growing .
What to you feel are the main causes of this ?
What are the effects ?
Obesity is one of the most important challenges of the current society due to the fact that people suffering from it has been growing alarmingly .
This essay will look at the some of the key causes and effects of overweight among people .
Firstly , food habits such as fast food and sedentary lifestyle are some of the main causes of surge in weight among people .
For instance , there are many studies by various bodies in the US show that more and more teenagers are spending most of their time in front of TV or computer playing video games , they hardly perform any sort of physical activity and also indulge in fast food .
This shows that fried or package food and complete lack of exercise are the chief reasons for increase in obesity among young people .
Secondly , bullying among teenagers and rise in heart attacks are some of the main effects among people who are obese .
For example , it should be noted that , recent studies by WHO has revealed that obese people are prone to bullying and there is rise in number of cases of heart attacks among young people with obesity .
This example shows that people with obesity not only suffer from bullying but also from heart attacks .
Having looked at both causes and effects of overweight among people , it is recommended that people take care of eating habits by reducing the intake of fast food and also take time out to exercise to lead a health lifestyle for their own benefit .
Dear friend :
How are your things ? I went to our new shopping centre last week .
I spent a really good time with my boyfriend , this place is outside the city centre of Granada , in Spain .
I liked this shopping centre because it has a lot of women 's shops inside , the facilities are quite atracctive and very up - to - day , the green zones are wide and it is supplied with a lot of wooden benches .
I bought two kinds of clothes , casual clothes for every day and outfit for an occasion to my cousin 's wedding the next month .
See you soon ¡
Best regards

Peter looked at his watch and knew he had to do something immediately .
He had been stuck in this blizzard for a lot of time .
He did n't know what to do , he tried to call someone , but the line did n't work .
He was starting to get nervous , he was arriving late to his sister 's wedding , it was probably the best day of her life and he was n't there with her .
When the first hour had passed he decided he would go walking .
When he opened the door a cold wind whipped him hard but he did n't care about it and kept going .
The sky was cloudy , the temperature was below zero , the wind made him not being able to walk and it 's now when he realized why was her sister celebrating her wedding on these dates .
He began to feel wet and that was when he noticed that it was raining heavily .
He could n't believe it , but he could n't stop walking he had to get to church .
Peter opened the door and everybody turned around to watch him .
He was wet , cold , starving and outside the weather had worsened , the road was flooded and the cars could n't pass .
But Peter did not regret having walked in the pouring rain , because he had been with his sister on her special day .
There are plenty of sports . some can be practiced indoors , some outdoors and others in water .
For me , these are the most incredible sports that anyone can perform .
Swimming is one of the most complete sports because you use every part of your body in order to sustain and advance the water .
The ideal is to start practicing this sport as children , because the oldest you are is more difficult to overcome fear , but it is never too late to learn to swim .
This sport combines the movement of arms and legs with breathing , as coordination between these parties is crucial .
Among the advantages of swimming we can highlight the following :
1 .
to delay aging , it increases memory and the ability to move .
2 . burn more calories , because in the water , the muscles work 5 times more than on outside it .
3 .
Improving the respiratory system .
4 . Eliminate back pain and bones .
5 . Relax not only the body but also the mind , so that the stress decreases considerably .
If you want to know more and learn to practice this sport , we recommend attending a specialized school , there are many good and not so expensive , where you can count with the support of a qualified instructor who will give you the confidence to start .

There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
As you do not have to wait for set time tables and follow fixed routes .
You can go anywhere you want and even during the night when the public transport is scarce or it could be unsafe .
Driving your own car gives you more freedom in travelling and increases your sense of independence .
However , a car is not always more economical to run because for example , you have to pay road taxes , insurance , and motor tests .
Not to mention the combustible .
Generally speaking , cars generates more pollution than any public transport .
The main reason of this , is that cars use diesel or petrol , whereas trains use electricity .
It is also important to mention that people who drives its own car most the time travel on their own .
Finally , another advantage over private cars is that it reduced the traffic chaos .
To sum up , I think the future in transport is just starting up .
From 17th to 20th March me and my schoolmates , and also the 2 M , went to a trip to Sicily .
We stayed here for 4 days and we visited Taormina , Siracusa , Agrigento , Marsala and a little part of Trapani .
We flew from Orio Al Serio to Catania : to me was the first time I took an air , and it was amazing , but at the beginning I had a little bit of headache .
When we arrived in Catania the bus driver bring us in a café to have breakfast .
Then we went to Taormina and we visited a lot of things : the Greek theatre , Corvaia palace and the Sicilian ' pupi ' , Roman Odeon and a public garden and other beautiful places .
Then we had lunch and went to ' Giardini Naxos ' and we saw the necropolis .
In the evening we went to Siracusa and we stayed in the hotel because we were tired .
The next morning we visited Siracusa and in the afternoon we went to Ortigia island where we had a little bit of free time .
From Siracusa we moved to Agrigento where a lot of us stay in the hotel that night .
In Garigento we saw the ' Valle Dei templi ' and a museum and in the afternoon we moved to ' Santa Maria Dei Greci ' .
We saw also Pirandell 's house , and after this we went to Marsala . during the evening we stayed in the hotel and in the morning we saw a museum and then we moved to Trapani where we visited the saltworks .
Then we had free time for 1 hour , but soon we had to go to the airport to take the air and come back here .
It was an incredible trip !
I have an unusual car .
It looks like regular cars but has some advantages .
First of all , my car has high speed .
Secondly , it can fly .
Besides , my car is considerably powerful than other means of transport .
It does not need a fuel because there are different forces which raise the car in the air .
My transport is blue like the sky .
Using this transport I will go to New Zeland then Australia and other countries .
I want to see tropical animals , birds and meet with local population .
Besides , I am going to look migration of the biggest animals of the world - whales .
Travelling by car is muc more convenient , as many people say , but public transport is much better for the environment .
There are now 8 billion people living on our earth and if everyone would drive a car , the smoke would be so high , that we could n't live here anymore .
Many people use public transport every day and I think this is good for our communication , because we can talk to other people .
It is also good for our environment because there is just one bus for 80 people .
There would be much more exhaust if every person is driving a car .
Public transport will increase in the future , because every year there are more trainstations , and more streets .
The Weeping Angel is a thriller full of haunting beauty and intrigue .
It unravels in the modern New York among anonymous office buildings and empty - eyed crowds .
The hero finds all his friends disappear one by one .
Looking for traces of those he loved , he stumbles upon a truth that was hidden in plain sight .
Only by looking in the eyes of the stone - cold danger can he evade the disappearance himself .
He might have tricked the monsters into a trap , but such creatures , almost too evil to be real , can never be stopped .
My favourite sport is swimming . I like it because it makes me feel free , independent and happy .
It is an individual but also team activity .
In my opinion it is one of the healthiest sport there are beacuse you can train not only your body but you can also develop your breath .
I do not practice swimming in competitions but almost since I was 3 years old .
I always had great coaches who trained me according to my ability so that I did not go never over my limit .
I have always felt comfortable as a child with my tank mates .
During these years I have changed three times around pools .
At the moment I am training at the Turin Sisport near Mirafiori .
Is a sport quite tiring but you can relax when the coach says it 's time to take a break .
If I had to give advice to someone who wants starting this sport I would tell him not to worry if he does n't feel confident .
If he was afraid of the water it is not recommended to practice this sport , or be able to break down his fear would be a great goal .
All in all I would recommend to anyone to play this sport .
It is a sport that purifies and regenerates you .
If we talk about my favourite sport , basketball will be .
I love basketball , though I rarely play basketball because it is hard to find a stadium to play basketball in Thailand .
I like basketball because it is one of the easiest sport .
Let 's talk about the advantages of playing basketball .
I think playing basketball help me to be healthy .
If someone wants to play some sport , basketball is my first advice .
It is an easy sport to play for anyone who never play any sport before .
So , newbies can understand and know the rules easily .
These are the story about basketball , my favourite sport .
It 's true that not many people consider the members of their family their best friends .
Neither do I. However , I have a curious opinion .
On the one hand , your relatives are the people who will be always part of you .
Nobody can leave a family as there will be a bloody union .
So , it would be a good choice to consider them your friends .
It is more possible losing contact with a friend than with the family .
Otherwise , it happens that sometimes you have an argument with a family member and you need to talk to a friend to be cheered up .
If you talk to a friend , who is also a member of your family , the situation could turn out to be a little awkward .
All in all , how we can see there are many advantages and disadvantages of considering the members of your family your best friends .
From my point of view , friendship is based on the honesty .
What 's more , not only is your best friend the person who never lies you , but also is the person who is always by your side .
If a family member was like that , it could turn into my best friend .
The housing situation for young people in my country
Introduction :
The purpose of this report is to evaluate the range of options available for many twenty - somethings in order to choose their housing system in my country , as well as the main obstacles they face with each one .
Moreover , it will also describe the possible housing outlook in the next years and the consequences for young people .
Who can afford a house ?
Nowadays owning your own house has become an uphill struggle unless you were willing to pay through the nose for it .
Due to the enormous economic crisis that have shaken Europe and that have intoxicated the real - estate market , most of the prices are eye - watering expensive for college students that want to study abroad or simply emancipate .
Even if they manage to save the amount of money for a flat it usually has not enough room to swing a cat .
In addition the unwillingness of the banks to lend money to anyone without a stable job is something important to take into account .
If you can not afford it , then just rent it .
Although renting is the first option for most of the youth , rents also had been affected for the housing bubble and their prices have shot up too .
Then , sharing the costs could be the solution for lots of students beyond all the problems that could arise from the communal living .
At least you 'll always have your parents .
In order to save up for future plans , a large number of early adults prefer to stay under the wing of parents rather than leaping in the dark and go out .
That could be end in constant arguments because of issues like intimacy and so on .
What about the future ?
The future remains uncertain until the economic situation gets over .
As there are no many signs for this to become real , young people must wait to start their own lives .
My favourite sport is running .
It keeps me fit , be healthy and full of energy .
When I run I feel relaxed , I forgot all my troubles and stresses .
It refreshed me .
Once , I took part in half - marathon .
At first , I could n't believe that I can do this .
But then I proved to myself that everything is possible .
In addition , I met new friends here , they are very clever and physically strong .
They teach me the techniques of how to run faster .
I keep practicing with them running around West Lake every Saturday .
After the race we get around in the cafe , drink beer and have a nice conversation .
It was a great time .
My next goal is to participate in full - marathon .
Also running improves my willpower , because I have to wake up early in the morning and run , without fail .
I become more organized , and I managed to do more than I could imagined .
I think everything is possible when you are organized . You start to build your own timetable , which make your life more easy and effective .
It helps you not to waste your time .
I think it is the key to success .
We can learn that a lot of successful people are very organized .
In my opinion , sport plays a great role in our life .
This company has the intention of setting up some training courses for staff so I came up with the idea of having a course that concentrates on company morale .
I consider this course as a priority in order to get every employee to feel motivated and involved in what this company has to offer .
I strongly believe in the idea of having a comfortable office environment , because when you like what you are doing and also where you doing it , you will do it the best you can .
I recommend that everyone at this department take the course , that way we could have the perception of all the employees and focus in what we need to improve and canalize it into profits .
This courses will last about a week and I suggest we only take from two to three hours per day so it does n't become tedious and we can keep everyone interested .
In conclusion this will get everyone feel part of the company and have everyone 's opinions .
yesterday , I watched a science fiction movie called blade runner .
The movie was first released in 1982 and directed by Ridley Scott who is the director of Alien .
The story of blade runner is about a police officer named dickard who is working as a killer for the most dangerous robots on earth which they called the replicants , and they are dangerous on human .
The film events happened in Los Angels in late 2019 , there are 4 robots in the story and each robot has his own character , and the most famous and dangerous one is called batty , he is a very advanced robot and has many skills and abilities .
Dickard the police officer killed three robots in the film , but at the end of the movie and before he tried to kill the last robot , he discovered that batty has emotions and feelings instead of his mechanism body because he saved dickard 's life at the end of the film .
Travelling has an important role in our everyday life , we need to get to work , school , want to meet our friends .
Most of those plans would not be possible , if there were not for means of transport .
But which one , public transport or our own car we will be choosing more often in future ?
On the one hand it is more convenient to have a car .
Owning vechicle is very comfortable and gives you independence .
It enable you to go everywhere you want no matter when .
You can also stop caring about how much you taking to work and on trips , being able to hide all those things inside of your trunk while it is impossible in any other means of transport ,
On the other hand , having your own car is expensive and no everyone could afford it .
For those people there is always another option - public transport .
It is not only cheaper , but also saves you from such problems as lack of parking places and reduce traffic jams .
Moreover , travelling by trains , trams or buses produces less exhaust fumes and as a result saves ozone layer .
To sum up , travelling using public transport is more beneficial for both environment and travellers .
I am convinced , that in spite of comfortable cars , public transport will be constantly developing .
Hi Sara ,
thanks for your interest , you 're very kind !
Yes , I know , it was a difficult decision to take , but I am too stressed here , I need a break , so I decided to travel to England , the country I have ever wanted to visit but I 've never been there .
For this the first think I 'd like to do when I 'll arrive is to visit the country , I want to do this during the first month , every day I want to enjoy myself visiting new places !
After I 'll need to make some money , my parents will give me some but they wo n't be enough for six months , so I must find a job !
I need to ask you for some help , you 're the only person I know who lives there , so the only one who can help me .
The first thing I must ask you is if you could find a place where I can stay , a motel or , better , a shared house . I know it 's a lot to ask but could you send me a contact of a company that is looking for a part - time staff ?
Thanks a lot
I hope to see you soon !
kiss , Gloria .
Stem cells are undifferentiated biological cells that can differentiate into specialized cells and divide to produce more stem cells .
They can also treat or prevent a disease or condition , and are used by the scientists in researches , and by the doctors .
I think it is a really good idea to use the stem cells in order to save other people 's lives , even if they come from an abroted foetus .
There are a lot of people in this world that are ill and need stem cells in their healing process , so parents that had an abroted foetus should let the scientists and the doctors use the stem cells in their research , and help other people .
Science nowadays developed a lot , and gave the population a lot of possibilities like storing the stem cells and using them to heal the future health problems anyone could have .
All in all , I suppose a lot of people disagree with this subject because it is not a good idea for them , but in my opinion it is a really good idea to save other people 's lives by taking stem cells from an aborted foetus .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to inform visitors of Leonberg about our shopping facilities .
Findings
When you come to Leonberg you will find many useful shops .
The most popular retail stores are located in our famous mall called Leo Center .
There you can find almost anything you want from clothes to electronics and groceries to beauty products and flowers .
Furthermore , the picturesque old town of Leonberg has a number of lovely small corner shops where you can by local food and handmade products .
Even if you are interested in more than ordinary shopping you will be satisfied in Leonberg .
We provide a big furniture store , an extraordinary market garden , a well - known home improvement store , and also a large bike retailer with professionally trained shop assistants .
Recommendations
Depending on your personal interests you should head for different quarters of Leonberg .
If you prefer to walk around and get a feeling for the town 's culture , you should go to one of both historic town centers .
If you rather like faster shopping I suggest you visit our Leo Center .
In my opinion shopping is not always enjoyable , especially for men .
When the women spend the hours in the shops , men must go with them .
It 's a suffering for every man .
First , they have to spend the many and waste time witch they could spend watching TV .
Shopping is not enjoyable also , when we must buy something , in this case we ca n't find what we want , generally , people do n't like the things which they have to do .
In this situation , we are nerves and stress .
Sometimes , your shopping turn out to be unsuccessful and you are desperate because you wasted money .
But , if you are woman and you are lots of money and time you will be always content during the shopping .
If we look around us , we can see a lot of facilities .
If we think about them , we would realize that we are lucky because of the simple fact of enjoy them .
They have not always been here , and they will not be here for ever .
One of the momentous human aims is to make eternal the life as much as it could be possible .
For this reason , we are always involved in the project of improving the facilities for life , and one of the most important aspects of the project is the home .
Nowadays , we have a lot of electronic devices such as microwaves , remote contols for tv , electronic devices for cooking , personal computers , and so on and so forth .
Each one make the everyday life a bit more easy , but a real progress on home would be electronic devices that were connected to the mind .
This would be my ' home of future ' .
An inner electronic system would compose the whole house ; it would include small devices of wave reception connected , in every side of house , to a gum headband whose function would be to identify the neuronal stimuli and to convert them on radiowaves .
This headband would be related to household chores such that if you would need to washing dishes or to sweeping , you only may to think about it and the robotized system of the house would send orders to each part of the house itself .
This system would also be connected to the Internet in a ' dual output port remote of information ' .
Having explained it , I am completely sure that this outline of my ' house of future ' will astonish and marvel everyone who read my sublime project .
Dear Paul ,
How are you donig ? I remember you wanted me to tell you about my experience with helping at a concert I 've been to last month .
I am glad to tell you that it was awesome and I hope that I will be able to do something like that again . I am convinced that it was one of the best days in my life .
It all started when I applied for being a volunteer at this event .
I did n't think that I have any chance to get there , because of the big amount of rivals .
But I fortunately did it .
I attached to a group of people who were responsible for informing public about the programme and all the organisation stuff .
There were so many guests and I was afraid that it will be too hard for me to do it right .
But my new friends from this group were very polite and we worked together , so it was much easier , than I thought at first .
After some time I felt sad , because I realised that I wo n't be albe to see the bend playing at the stage , because I had to stay in front of the entry .
But after the first song , when the audience started to sing and dance , our manager came to us and told us that we can go see the concert .
I was so extremely happy .
I was having a great time through the entire concert .
After that we went to the backstage and spent some time with the band .
We took some pohotos and got autographs .
It was really cool .
As you can see , it was all really amazing .
I met a lot of fantastic people and I am still in touch with them .
I hope that next time you will be able to go with me .
Love , XY .
That was a mistake .
A BIG mistake .
Michael do n't know anything about love and sweetness .
Like everyone else on this planet ... I think ?
Anyway , you know what ?
The only thing he knew when he came to Mandy 's home was this : The world does n't turn around him .
He came and the first word he said was :
- " Shit ! "
Yes , I know , not very smart .
But this is Michael .
And Michael do n't care what people think about him .
And this is the " Mandy moment " .
- " What ? What 's again wrong with you ?
- Nothing . I 've lost my apartment 's keys .
Where are these fucking bastards keys ? ......
- ... You never change .
You always do something wrong .
This is you .
YOU .
Michael the big man , who can do everything in the whole damn world , except care of his keys , I guess ... "
I think I 've neglected to explain one thing to you ?
Michael was , at this moment , angry .
But not angry like you and me .
No no no .
Angry like a tiger , or something else who 's bad , naughty and terrific .
Yeah .
And that was how Michael was at this moment .
- " What is your problem ?
- What ?
- I do n't repeat myself a third time : What is your problem ?
- I 've no problem with you !
You 're always like that .
You 're fucked up all the time . "
He hit her .
That was all .
He taking his bag and he goes to the door .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .

Travelling by car is much more convenient than using public transport for various obvious reasons .
But , considering the increase in private vehicles in our crowdly populated world , it is recommended by geologists and eco - scientists that we use public transportation .
By this way , we not only contribute to saving our eco - system , we also contribute to increasing the national revenue .
When mobile phones have conquered our palms , we have no time to even meet our parents and children .
Our interaction with human beings have pathetically reduced .
Exchanging greetings , expressing emotions , updating work status , gaming , studying and more have become activities we do using mobile phones .
Cars are mostly used by people travelling for long distances in shorter time .
Inside cities and for shorter distances , nothing can be more comfortable and safe than public transport .
Using public transport not only helps us reach our destination safely , but also gives us ample opportunities to network and be with our people .
They are safer , cheaper and faster .
Even if cars outnumber users , public transport will continue to help and support us in a safe and a healthy living .
For centuries the population of the world has been dreamt of commuting anywhere comfortably by car .
How many of us stand from our bed already exhausted from the only thought of getting into a public transport ?
It was thinking about this major problem that , the governments from around the world has launched the greatest and ambitious plan .
To start with cars are going to be made by using the high technology at lower cost , therefore affordable to all .
City development is already under construction .
New motorways , streets , parking are not longer sit on the council 's offices , waiting to be signed , they are reality transforming the world landscape .
Could we ever think of such dream coming true ? All this is beyond my imagination and understanding , whereas the use of new technologies could be used to give the world a much better healthy environment and less egocentric .
Dear John
I am very interested in to start a pet - care franchise because I like pets and I think all these services would be very helpful for a lot of people in my country too .
Can you tell me more about the possibilities of taking out a Petpals franchise in my country .
I would like to know with how many initial investment I have to calculate ?
How many hours do you work in this business and when are the working hours ?
Is this more in the evening or on the weekend ?
Another thing I would like to know is how much turnover / profit can I expect in the first year ?
In your article you write from a education center with assistance for new franchisees .
Which training do you offer ?
Can you send me an offer ?
Thank you very much for you help .
Yours sincerely
Isabel
In the future our lives will be much more difficult because we 'll struggle for everything alone .
We have started to struggle alone .
We'll get lonely more and more and also selfish , too .
No one will help each other .
Everyone will get help from the machines or technological items .
Technology will be our best friends .
Despite this our appearance will change .Our fashion will be more technique .
I ca n't imagine what things we might eat in the future .
Pills ?
Just for saving time ?
Because we wo n't have time to eat delicious food and drink an exquisite wine and have a chat with a friend .
What about the relationship ?
Well , I do n't think that we will build a close relationship with anyone and building a family will be even worse .
The family might exist on paper but not in real because each member in the family will be busy and they will just send some masseges from the high technology phones they 'll have at that time .
I know , it sounds boring and pessimistic but if we wo n't change our minds imediately , the future is going to be like that , for sure .
This bar chart depicts an average of knowledge on reading and writing for female and male on six different regions in 2000 .
From an overall perspective it is notable a higher amount of illiterate women in all the regions compared with men , who are in some cases the half part of the total of women in each region .
Developed countries , Latin America and East Asia are the three regions that depict a low percentage of illiterate people , expresed below 20% , whereas Sub - Saharan Africa , Arab States and South Asia are above 30% of people who do not know read and write .
Developed countries figures are the lowest , being almost at 1% , whilst South Asia numbers rose extremely , reaching almost a 60% in the case of female gender and overtaking the 30% in the male gender .
As we can see , an unequal percentage are shown depending on the area where the people come from .
Buenos Aires is a city made for tourists , visitors can do so many activities in a small radio of the city , dance Tango , eat traditional meet or visit a beautiful library are some of them .
Furthermore there are many places where tourist can buy many things , such as a typical mate or a picture from the obelisco porteño .
But if visitors want something more than a typical souvenir , they can visit canteens or a bar where are set tango shows and take they own pictures or even buy a CD with the traditional music from Buenos Aires .
There are also places where peolpe can buy the typical clothes , dark dresses for women or a ' tango hat ' for man .
Even if you want just go shopping for clothes , there are so many places where you can go , Palermo is known as a little New York for the disigners and well know marks , and technology is set on Recoleta .
So , Buenos Aires , also know as the Paris from America , gives all visitors the opportunity for meeting Argentinian tradition in only one city that involves the history and the culture of the country .
Pontevedra in its way to become a green town .
Pontevedra has been one of the most polluted towns from Galicia for many years .
We had two factories and a great amount of traffic problems .
We did not even knew what to do with our garbage .
Finally , we polluted our rivers .
First of all , let me tell you there has been a great change in people 's minds .
We thought the factories were good because they allowed a great amount of people to work there .
Later , we realized the factories could be moved elsewhere .
We started to appreciate the advantages of walking .
Last but not least , we also became proud of our beautiful rivers .
When the new mayor arrived , he decided to move the traffic away from the city centre .
At the beginning , this was a much controversial decision .
Later , he also ordered to clean our wet zones too .
Finally , he has championed moving Celulosas factory to a safer place .
Pontevedra is going greener .
We have suffered like every other city these rough years .
Nevertheless , our passion is still strong .
We want to move away the last factory from the river .
Although we have made great strides , there are still a lot of things to do .
In many countries , it 's consider that the relatives are the close family and the only people with an individual can be just the way he is .
This point of view is based on , for example , that you shares an important bond with your family or that you know everything about some members , like your cousins and they know everything about you .
Maybe , most of us have spent our childhood with our cousins and they were our best friends for ages .
Siblings are another strong point to support this statement .
It 's usual to hear that this kind of bond is the strongest inside a family , because everybody thinks that siblings are the only ones whom you could rely on , despite not always it 's true .
I should talk in the third person because I do n't have any brothers or sisters , but a close cousins .
In my case , this role is played by them .
On the other hand , we can find arguments against this statement .
For example , the debate about the statement that you can not choose your family , but your friends .
Thus , it fits perfect for those people who have a bad relation with their families .
They have to look for the needs provided by the family in other people with whom they can trust .
In conclusion , from my point of view , it 's true that is less probable to find negative feelings inside family , like envy , refuse or hate .
So , if you tell a secret to your sister or your cousin , it 's almost obvious that they are n't going to spread it .
Even , if you look for a good advice , some members of your family could help you from the heart .
But , family not always guarantees these functions neither friends .
However , friends can be as a family and fulfil all this functions , too .
Therefore , I only would like to remark that family not means relatives , but those people with whom you can feel as at home .
That is , in any place suddenly you can find someone who could become in your most close relative .
I decided to take one class of Liceo Oberdan to visit a Miramare harbor reserve .
It is a lovely place not far from our school , and I think it 's interesting in his natural habitat .
I decided to do this , in according to the biology teacher .
During this year she had explained the harbor world , in particular the world of Miramare , and I describe the same things under the geography aspects .
I was just a bit worried because in this class there are 28 students , but they are very respectful and clever .
We took the local bus and we arrived at ten in this place .
Here we found some very expert guides who takes us in a good touring along the park and the harbor reserve .
Every students were interested in the information and they asked a lot of explanations .
In this day the students had the oppportunity to hear very interesting things , but not as they were in a class during a traditional frontal lesson .
They had improved their knowledge making experience in the field .
I think that the students will not forget very soon what they have learned .
In recent years , whether using internet is beneficial or not has never failed to attract people 's attention .
While many people believe that internet brings a vast amount of problems such as reduction of interaction between people and some bad information resources ; in contrast , I have a strong position that internet brings manyfold benefit than drawbacks .
People should first recognize that searching information these days is much more convenient than in the past .
We must come to library to pay a lot of time finding information we need on the shelves the earlier time .
On the other hand , we can assess the information with only a click button nowadays .
Clearly , the assessment become much more efficiently with computer and internet .
Yet , perhaps the strongest argument in favor of using internet is that the vast amount of information contended in it .
All the information in the world can emerge immediately after a click .
Admittedly , some knowledge is not accurate and logical enough , it still offers us many other useful sources .
Simultaneously , some sources contended pornography and violent information which make many people afraid of using internet to search information .
Nevertheless , it remains a good way to reserve and supply information which hoped to have more flows in the future .
I think , one of the important historical places in Japan is the Kiyomizu temple in Kyoto .
It is well - known with a great beautiful Buddhist temple in Japan and it 's also famous among foreigner .
Kiyomizu temple was built in the middle of Edo era .
It has five stairs and one of the tallest historical building in Kyoto .
People can see a great Japanese view from there .
It is a great and famous sightseeing place and it also is an important place of Japanese culture .
Kiyomizu temple was used many times as a background of a lot of Japanese novels , paints and historical dramas .
Artists think the top of the temple is good for making beautiful , nervous mood of stories or paints .
Also , the temple became a Japanese proverb which is " feel like falling from the top of Kiyomizu " .
It means " very scared and nervous " because the temple is very tall and it makes people such a feeling .

Hi Shannon !
It 's nice to hear about you , as soon as you arrived there are some secure options to you .
First of all , you can use a taxi and give the address you have to the driver , this is an expensive ( but easy ) option .
On the other hand you have the public service called Metrobus , in this case you will hop off the bus a few times , when you arrived you must find the A - line , go to the patriotismo starion ( C line ) , then go to the delta station and walk to the # 76 of Acrone avenue .
If you love the extreme travels I recommend the Mexico 's city subway , it 's easy because there is a station in front of my house , so you need to go to the a-2 subway and go to Génova station ( it 's important to say that in the airport you have access of each one of the options )
If I were you I would choose the subway because wearher in Mexico is too hot , so , I think you do n't want to feel the sun after your bored trip .
If you need more information about it , please call me when you arrived .
Best wishes .
Omar .
In the last ten years , Brazil has created a wide range of governamental programmes .
Educational and medical assistance , as well as infraestructure improvements are some of the recent advancement .
One of the best examples in education has been a scholarship programme called Science Without Borders .
It offers students a unique opportunity to study abroad aquiring an international standard qualification .
In addition to this , it provides them with access to the newest research developments .
As a consequence of this investment , the state is contributing to the improvement in the career of Brazilian professionals .
On the other hand a problem could stem from the lack of incentives to the nationwide educational institutions .
This problem would be the low level of the national education .
Therefore , in order to avoid giving rise to any further complications , Brazilian authorities should bear in mind the development of both , national and international programmes .
As a result , the quality would be guaranteed .
Dear Sir / Madam :
I am writing because I recently see your advertisement and I am interested in it .
I am having some free months and I want to gain some money .
I am studying Civil Engineering and I am a very energetic person , and I think that this ability is essential for the job that you are searching .
Other important aspect it 's that I am a good organizer and I am a good team worker .
Another important reason is that I want to have somequiringe money for personal things .
For all the reason that I describe to you , I am sure that this summer good would be good for me , and for the Summer Camp .
I think that it is a really good option to achieve experience and for doing different and interesting things , like organise sport activities , and funny activities for children .
I leave here my personal contact information and wait for a positive answer from us .
Yours sincerely ,

Topic : A Horrible Nightmare
At the evening , my classmate phoned me and said , " There is an exciting film on TV now ! "
He did n't mention it is a horror movie .
When I watched until the middle of the film , it is scary .
But I could n't find the remote control , I could n't switch off the TV and I watched the whole film .
I went to bed and sleep .
A while later , I discovered I was in a huge old museum .
There were a lot of ancient things such as clocks , cars , weapons .
Then , some skeletons and dead people came out and chased me .
Fortunately , I got an old machine gun .
And shoot all down .
But I fell into a grave .
There was very dark .
I screamed my lungs out .
I woke up in surprise .
At last , my mother comforted me and gave me a glass of warm milk .
She told me not to watch horror movie again .

2 ) explain which dishes Italians usually and what time of the day .
3 ) conclusion
Hi Alison , of course I 'll help you .
I think it 's very interesting discover how foreign people usually eat .
It is another way to discover one culture .
Italians to start the day generally they have a strong coffee and some biscuit or slide bread .
It 's typical eating pasta as a starter at lunch .
Which is cooked in different ways .
It is common having meat as a main course .
To finish the lunch in Italy we eat fruit .
In my country we have a dinner late as a habit .
It 's more common eat pizza .
We have it as take away or we go in some pizzeria .
I hope this information can be useful for you .
Take care

About me
Hello !
My name is Theodor Forsberg and I am 13 years old .
I live in Stocksund with my mom Anna - Karin and in Djursholm with my dad Lukas and my little brother Jonathan .
In my spare time I like to play hockey and be with friends .
I play hockey almost every day and I love it . I started to play hockey when I was nine and a half so I was not as good as everybody else but that did not stop me .
I started to play hockey when I was nine and a half so I was not as good as everybody else but that did not stop me .
I have played a lot of other sports like Karate , Soccer , Tennis and indoor bandy .
A lot of my close friends that I went in stocksund skolan and that I played hockey with went to Samskolan but that is a little bit too far away so I decided to go to Friberga instead .
I really like the school and it is going good so far .
I have always been really good at English .
And I think that I am that because I watch a lot of tv - shows on English
The thing I like the most about myself is probably my hair , legs , mouth and hands .

Have you ever been worried when you do n't have enough time to study in the day ?
Or maybe you do n't have a study plan that works ?
Well here , there are some advice or ideas that have worked for me .
First of all , make a to - do list of all your activities and routines .
That 's the easy part .
Do n't forget to recognise the most activities and tasks for you .
It 's very important , because if you do n't do that , so it 'll never work .
You have to put a time to do your tasks .
For instance , when you stay at university class or something like that , you should remember how much time you have to do it .
Finally , it depends on that works for you , because you have to be constantly remembering the time that you do your tasks .
It was late night and Michael went surrounded with deep dark to the edge of the forest .
The visibility was very poor because the moon was hiding behind dark grey shadows , but Michael went on the memory .
Suddenly , a thumledown cottage emerged from the darkness .
Michael up two little steps and heard wail of the wind .
But it was n't the wind .
Someone was singing a sad song .
He felt a range and a fear of disclosure . " Why is she singing ?
Is she mad ?
The Nazis can be everywhere , " he thought and unlocked the door with a little key .
" Stop with the singing !
" he whispered , " someone can hear it . "
Then he calm down and took a little packet out of his pocket and put it on the floor .
There were two slices of a bread and a little apple inside the packet .
He was starving more then ever since he had hidden a young Jewish woman .
On the other hand , she was related to him by blood and how could he said No ! when she came and bagged him for help .
She said nothing and made herself invisible .
He entered decided that he will stay over the night .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
well since my chillhood I always love weapons , my father gave me my first rifle when I was 7 , but it was until I was 15 when I found my real passion , and it was the archery , since that day I am proud to say that I am an archer , and that the archery is my favorite sport .
I just love when you take your bow and prepare to shoot an arrow , and before shooting it your are part of the bow , and you feel that the bow is a part of your body , after that , when you shoot the arrow you are able to see the curve that it makes before hitting the target , I would say this is why I love this sport and why I enjoy it so much .
if I would have the opportunity of giving some advice to a person that is starting in this sport , I would tell him to do not give up , because this ai nt an easy sport , and that is more mental than physical
I think that you made a great choice by visiting Timisoara .
One of the most beautiful place that you can visit in this town is The Latin - Catholic - Dom , located in Unirii Square .
I should present a little bit of history of it .
After more than seven hundred years , in 1733 , the latin - catholic bishops residence was moved from Cenad to Timisoara , where the first cathedral became the church of jesuists monks .
The design of the actual Dom was realized in baroque style of Vienna .
The cathedral hasa height of 55 m. The Dom was rise at rank of first church of Timisoara by the empress Maria Tereza in 1756.What is very interesting to see is a painting made by Michelangelo Uterberger showing Saint Gheorghe riding and fighting with the basilisk .
The visitors programme is from Monday to Sunday , from ten o'clock a.m to six p.m. And a phone number where you can call for more information is 0040212345678 .
PEOPLE LIVES WILL CHANGE DRAMATICALLY IN THE NEXT 50 YEARS .
This essay discusses the advantages and disadvantages that we will find the next 50 years .
It will consider some relevant items which will be completely changed in the future , as well as arguing and explaining the pros and cons of everything .
First of all , one of the biggest changes in a medium term will be the transport .
Roads transport will die away as you know it nowadays .
Instead of it , imaginary road network will be built in our air space .
Furthermore , environment will suffer the terrible effects of current lifestyle .
Consequently , protected clothes , which will be made with materials and NASA technology , will be worn by future population .
This will be so because of the pollution , the radiation existent and the increase of global warning .
On the other hand , the benefits of healthy will be important .
In fact , the development of different vaccines would be possible to get over a great deal of diseases .
To sum up , it is vital that nowadays thinking of our future .
If we develop our different knowledge areas , we will achieve a better world .
It is high time we changed our lifestyle .
My idol was , is and will always be Justin Bieber .
I remember the first time that I saw his videos , I did n't write his last name correctly and I could n't find him on YouTube .
It started when I was 12 or 13 years old , his music meant everything to me .
He was always talking about follow your dreams and never give up .
In 2014 I met a couple from One Direction called Larry Stylinson but they ca n't " come out " because of his managers .
I admire them because no matter what their managers make them go through , they always find the way to show us how much they love each other and how much they want to be free .
I really hope this " hiatus " , this is how they called their break , they can be happy and spend time together without fake girlfriends , managers or the media around them .
I want them to be happy .
Anyway , talking about Justin again , I 'm so proud of him , 2016 is his year and no one can deny that .
Famous people live completely in a different way than unpopular people .
It is believed they are extraordinary , perfectly beautiful and incredible happy like we see their in magazines and TV .
Everybody longs to be a well - known and admired person leading rich and carefree life .
Unfortunately , truly it is n't so amazing like it seems to be .
There are a lot of disadvantages of being a star , of witch normal people do n't realised for example not having a private life .
There are a lot of various viewpoints and I would like to consider them .
Famous people haven't got private life .
Almost every their mystery come out and they are still judged , criticised or joked .
Journalilst and paparazzi constantly follow them and try to catch them in a stupid situation and enhance ath the cost of them .
Everybody makes mistakes , but their mistakes are wtitten and known by the society , what is unfair and harmful .
They deserve to have a normal life , have mysteries , a moment of peace without interest around them .
Being all the time in a centre of attention is incredibly overwhelming .
It can lead to being touchy and gloomy .
That is why a lot of big name suffer from depression or even try take their life .
On the other side , there is a price of celebrity and they should just reconcile themselves to this .
They got so lot compared with unpopular people , that 's why I think it would be unfair , if they have also private life .
People can not have everything and live like they want .
They ought to apprecciate what they have and stop complaining aboout their life , because there is plenty of people , who dream to be them .
Famous people have to consider how many humans suffer from famine or work very hard to earn their living .
They have not got expensive cars , detached houses , they ca n't afford travelling and their only entertainment is watching TV .
They should remember they are lucky devils not like they often think - victim .
To sum up , It is hard to simply claim , that famous people deserve have a private life and being left alone by paparazzi or not .
Everyone from time to time need a moment of peace to relaxed and recover their strength .
However , nobody has everything they dreamed ; it is normal , that always in our lives something would be annoy us .
Famous people have to notice , how much they have , apprecciate it and stop complaining about not having a private life , because it is not such a disaster like they often think .
Day by day , the power of consumption increases more and more and one of the areas you can realize this is in the traffic .
People who have facilities to buy or finance something and looking for convenience , have a great desire to buy a car .
The bad quality of public transportation and the lack of options like underground and train , helps people choose to use a car .
These things makes we think if the public transport has a future , after all to do all the things you need in your routine like to go to work , to go shopping or just to go out with the family , is more comfortable by car than by bus .
Cars nowadays have technology that allow both drivers and passengers to have a better travel while listening to a music or use the internet without having to spend hours standing during the journey .
The government needs to invest in better conditions of the public transport , with more options to the transportation of citizens , in order to make it easier to go from a place to another , and hardest the decision to choose between car or bus .
Everything has two sides and the choice of transportation is not an exception .
People have been debated about whether private car or public transport is the first choice in recent years .
While reasons can be given to justify the latter , I am in favour of the former .
Firstly , travelling by train , metro or bus can lead to the reduction of gasoline consumption .
As a result , they offer low fee and play an important role in the environment protection .
It was reported that for one hundred kilometers running , each car was consumed ten to thirteen liters of gasoline , and released a certain proportion of air polutted .
Meanwhile , with the same amount of energy , bus carried fifties of people , and even up to as high as hundreds of people with the massed transportation .
Secondly , it could not be denied that travelling by car is convenient , however people who agreed with the idea point out that high quality and modern public transport such as Shingasen in Japan or TGV in Europe are much more comfortable .
Trains or MRTs
can also satisfy passengers who could not travel by plane and require to take long haut jouneys .
There are some places in developing countries , for example in remote or highland areas , people have not seen a car for many years , they have no choice except old buses to travel .
In conclusion , public transportation is still the first choice of people in the future .
Nowadays higher education becomes more and more necessary for starting a good career .
Let 's consider the attitudes to education and study in Russia and Australia .
There are some similarities ; however , differences in the educational system cause differences in the attitudes to education .
University education is valuable in Australia , just like in Russia .
In general most of employers prefer applicants which achieved an academic degree .
This attitude is quite similar in many countries .
During our last English lesson we talked about the future for public transport .
It was not an easy task to figure out if there is a future or not .
The most important argument was that travelling by car is much more convenient .
The fact that you can travel anywhere at any time is undeniable .
If you want to buy some vegetables for your dinner you will have to wait until the next train arrives at your station .
Due to the fact that our lifestyle is getting faster , nobody will have the time .
So in the near future there will be no longer a use for public transport .
Michael was one of the greatest drivers of all time .
He started his career when he was sixteen years old through kart competitions .
After only three years he passed on Benetton formula one team and two years after he won his first driver championship .
After won another title he signed a contract with Ferrari team .
At that point his work become very hard and stressful because at that time Ferrari was n't a very good car in fact that car was only able to go fast in a straight circuits .
Michael showed up his strength and his attention to details working close days and nights with his engineers .
Three years later after intense work Michael restarted to put his feet on the podium .
In 2000 he won his third driver championship with Ferrari and also won it consecutively for three years .
Then Ferrari with Michael decided for a new collaboration , so the greatest become a test driver tried to improve the car out of the racers .
In the meantime his mind always thought at Mercedes because of his youngest dreams .
Like every German , since he was a young driver , dreamed being a driver championship with the national car .
To summarize he arranged a meeting with the head of Ferrari and the media press because he would like to announce his defenitively
retirement .
This unfortunately was only an excuse he was only pretending to retired as he already signed a contract to drive Mercedes .
At the end of the conference Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
So many people around me think that makes not any sense spending community taxes in public transport .
These persons usually give arguments such as that the public transport is never in time , or that is difficult to get your destination using it and without having to take 3 different routes or even that public transport is not as suitable for a made up short notice trip as can be a car in property .
In my opinion these arguments depend on how efficiently designed is the public transport system , having in count number of routes , timetables , cost of the tickets and facilities for users who use it frequently .
It 's quite well known the benefits that a good public transport system gives to the community : an important reduction of contaminant gases , a hight decrease of acoustic contamination as well as , as consequence of having less cars circulating by our streets , an increase of pedestrian areas used by pedestrians for healthy activities such as walking , running or cycling .
All these benefits surely will contribute to a better future for all the habitants so let 's give a chance to the public transport .
My town is called Bra and it is a small town situated in Piedmont near Langhe .
The city began to take care of the environment only in the last ten years when the studies created technologies for not produce pollution .
In this area there are many fields where were built wind turbine for use the wind and creating electric energy .
In the roof of the supermarkets are situated solar panels and it exploit the sun for produce energy .
This means of renewable energy are better than the old methods because they do n't pollute .
All surfaces are used in the better way possible .
There are many green parks where you can do sport and other activity without pollution .
The cars are n't use more because there are many places where you can rent the bicycle and naturally it is free .
During the winter the means of transport is efficient and not very expensive so the people can do n't use their car .
The text discusses about some kinds of Asian Bamboo that have a unique form of flowering and seeding cycle , these cycles just happen at long intervals and all the members of the species tend to flower and then seed at the same time .
And if we consider the speech where the woman said that at the present this phenomenon is a problem because this bamboo is the main source of food to the Giant Panda that still lives in the jungle .
the Giant Panda is an endangered specie , the pandas have to survive to the hunters and the destruction of him habitat by the humans .
Besides , when the bamboos flowering and seeding they die , so until the new bamboos grow enough to be eaten by the pandas takes a long time and this fact forces the pandas to move to new places in order to look for food .
Therefore , the risks of the extinction to the Giant Pandas are real .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
My name is Fabio Rendón and I am from Spain .
I am on the point of finishing my Engineer 's degree in Mining Engineering , specialization in Energy , at Vigo University .
I am currently carrying out my Final Project as well as preparing the First Certificate Exam , planned for July and June , respectively .
I would love to improve both my practical knowledge about renewable energies and my English level , and I firmly believe that the Erasmus internship programme could be the best option for me to achieve these targets .
Thus , the aim of this letter is to explore the possibility of realizing an internship in your company .
In this programme , the trainee carries out different tasks supervised by a company tutor and also advised by a university tutor .
The trainee receives a grant to help to cover subsistence cost , so the company is not required to pay him a salary .
Furthermore , as the programme is endorsed by European Union , the trainee disposes of accident and liabiliy insurance .
As for the duration , the internship can last from a minimum of 2 months up to 12 months , being 3 months the period covered by the subsistence grant .
I will be completely available to do the internship from next September on .
I can assure you that I will put all my effort into learning and making the most of my stay in your company .
I hope you will consider my application , and look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
Fabio
Dear Jo , I do n't know if your is a good idea .
Now Italy has quite problem with the occupation , it 's very difficult to find a job and the most people find a job in supermarkets .
If you want to try , you can ask in some hotel : you are a native English speaker and you can welcome hosts at the reception .
I live in Valpolicella , a famous land for the wine , and I had already worked in a four stars hotel for high school .
IT was a good experience , the hotel has every comfort you can imagine : a reastaurant , a S.P.A. , a gym , indoor and outdoor swimmingpool , a beauty center and a church .
The personal were n't so much helpful , but someone luckily gave me some advice , especially the porter Artan .
He was amiable and liked Metal Music like me , so we always spoke about our favourite groups .
I do n't know if he still works there , but I 'm sure that you can find a great support in him .
Valpolicella has many location that worth to see : first of all Lake Garda , a lake with the famous phallic shape which divides three different regions ( Veneto , Trentino and Lombardy ) .
Orlando Duque , with the desire to come to the World cups of 2017
Colombian became the first diver to win a world cup in High - Jumps .
Orlando Duque //Red Bull
Orlando Duque , the Colombian diver , is the champion of high - jumps of the FINA World Cup 2014 , stated that since 2007 he is thinking about retirement even though he feels with force and desire to go to the World cup of 2017 in Guadalajara , México .
" I am thinking about retirement since 2007 . I have been lucky because I injured , I got better " , said Duque during the press conference of the World Series that this year will end up in Mexico on 17th and 18th October , after the competition of Bilbao ( Spain ) .
Duque , who was born in Cali on September 11th of 1974 , took a break in his career because an injury in his right leg in 2011 and after that , he returned in 2013 with the purpose of win the World Cup of Barcelona and the World Cup of FINA .
" I was 40 years three weeks ago , I feel motivated to train , while I have the motivation I can continue ; now I have no an exact date ( … ) I just have set 2017 in Guadalajara " , said Duque , who was the first sportsman who won a world championship of falls from height .
" Jumps have been my life , I have spent all my life in the jumps and it motivate me to do it , I want to continue " , explained Duque when he pointed out that he still has several screws in his right ankle and he is still lacking recover completely .
" The event of the Natural Well of Ik Kil ( Yucatán ) of 2011 was the last one that I had before the accident ; now , I am getting over the accident and I feel at the 70 per cent " , explained the Colombian sportsman who noted down February , 2015 as the date to return .
The Colombian high - jumper presented in Mexico the one that will be the last stage of this series which is promoted by an energy drink in the Natural Well Ik Kil , in the Mexican state of Yucatán .
The Natural Well Ik Kil , which is located three kilometers away from the archeological zone of Chichén Itza , will be the final one of the Jumps season , 2014 and in that season Duque and the Mexican Jonathan Paredes will face each other in order to be between the top five spots of the season .
The Britain Gary Hunt already secured the prize of this series and from the second to the sixth place will be disputed with the Russian Artem Silchenko , the American Steven LoBue , the Colombian Duque , the Britain Blake Aldridge and the Mexican Paredes .
" The plan is to win this competition because I always compete to win .
I am located in the fourth place , but we are so close to the second to the fourth ( in points ) so , the idea is jump very well even though the Natural Well is a difficult because it is dark " , explained Duque about his plan for the event in the Ik kil on 17th and 18th October .
In the male test , the high - jumpers are thrown out into the water from a height of 27 meters in height , whereas in the female competition the launch pad is placed 20 meters away .
My favorite sport is running .
One may ask why among all those possible activities , this one was chosen .
Of course I do not count running indoors , but only outdoors , while the breeze is blowing in one 's face during the exercise .
That is what I call a good activity .
There is not exactly a good day for running , for even the rainy days are excellent for a good run .
If one has a sunny and windy weather , it is nice because the sun warms one up and the wind helps keep it fresh .
On the other hand , if it is rainy , the cold water cools it down and make one feel less tired during one 's time .
This is my favorite sport for it improves health in some many ways and boost the resistance and quality of life .
The first times may be hard , in that they require a preparation a sedentary person does not have .
There can be some pain and almost everybody becomes really exhausted at the beginning .
After the first trials , however , improvements are shortly noticed and the results come quickly : better breathing , uninterrupted and quiet sleep , and an unmistakable sense of well - being .
It even helps reducing your belly !
Despite being a common and easy to do activity , running needs some care to prevent injuries and other disturbances as well .
Efficient sweat expeller socks help one reduce the uncomfortability and keep one 's feet in a nice temperature .
Notwithstanding , a formidable pair of shoes makes a huge difference if one plans to keep practising the sport for a long period .
Go to a doctor , ask him to analyse the type of step to make up with an ideal footwear .
This way , there will be less trouble when practising the exercise .
I must say that , as a runner , I do not regret it at any time .
Everybody can do , it is practical and simple , and the goals can be set in accord with the person 's needs and restrictions .
Do not hesitate to go out and try it out !
Take that pair of snickers and go for it !
I always considered football as a piece of art .
Does not matter how hard the players tried to win , the only thing that matters is the result .
Players must be considered as a paintor working in a piece of art .
Only results will be recognized at the end .
It 's not the efford they have applied or all the hopes they had .
There expectations will be considered unuseful .
Poeple wo n't stare a paint at a museum thinking how hard the artist tried to do a good job , they will judge it only .
Do they like it or not .
The crowd in the stadium only wants their team to win .
After that , if they played a good game will be a plus .
Everything after a successful result will be a plus .
So if someone ever is woundering start practising this sport , they should be aware that lots of people will be expecting them to win .
I would recommend them always remember that , so if things do n't result as they expected , they wo n't feel disappointed .
It 's all part of the game .
We are people and all of us must have private life including celebrities .
There is a great number of politicians and film stars who are followed by paparazz who are trying to know more about their private life .
I agree that film stars and famous politicians must have their free time because they are working for people everyday .
They must have some free time to have a rest without being seen .
It is quiet hard to have a rest when journalists are trying to know some exciting things about your private life .
On the other hand famous politicians and film stars have chosen such life .
It is a part of their everyday life , they are used to be on public and they are used to say something about themselves on cameras , so all the people will know about their life .
There are some moments when celebrities need some time to be with their families and friends and journalists must not touch such moments .
Everybody must have free time for yourself .
Hey Jo !
How are you ?
Good to know from you .
You want to come to Spain ? You should !
There is a lot of things to visit here .
You could do a tour of all the cities of Spain ' cos every one has something special that you must see .
Starting for the top , like Bilbao or Asturias .
You could do that and then , finish it in Barcelona , were I live .
There I could be your tour guide and show you the best of the city .
Finally if you want to find a job for three months Barcelona is a good option to stay .
There are a lot of places where you could work for a short period of time . Beeing a witress or something like this is well paid and not so dificult to do .
Hope that you follow my ideas and you like Spain
See you soon !

In the modern world , the company which has excellent stuff is more competitive , and these employees are usually motivated .
Therefore , good leaders should know how to motivate their staff .
It is clear that staff would spend more time on their tasks if they were motivated by their boss , while unmotivated employees are more likely to spend less effort in their jobs .
Generally speaking , there are two basic methods of employee motivation : rewards involving money and non - financial rewards .
Many leaders believe that money is the best , however , from my own perspective , the non - financial rewards are the best approach to motivate employees and I will prove my opinion in this essay .
I had never been very frightened until one day that something strange happened .
One night , I was talking with my sister about her last trip around Europe , her best friend , Michael , also was there .
My sister claimed that in her trip , she had seen completely astounded buildings , but while she was talking , we heard a very loud scream .
We did n't know what to do , so we only exchanged glances , then we decided to go out and see what had happened .
Outside was getting very cold and the sky was dark , so we could n't see anything but nevertheless we continue walking through the trees when suddenly we saw a very big shadow in front of us .
In that moment we started to run , except Michael .
When we got in the house , my sister and I realized that Michael was n't there .
We were very surprised and scared at the same time .
Ana and I decided to go outside to look for Michael , when we went out , he was in front of the house , doing strange sounds , when he saw us , smile to us in a malevolent way , then made us to back inside .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
My favorite sport is basketball .
I have noumerous reasons why I choose this sport as my favorite .
One reason why I love this particular sport is because it 's based on cooperation .
For example , if you play basketball and the ball is passed regularly then your team is more likely to win because passes cause confusion and exhaustion to the opponent team .
My advice to anyone who is starting this sport is to simply have fun .
On the other hand if he chooses to play professionally then he must try hard .
Regular exercising is potentionall so that he / she can build up strength and endurance
To conclude , I hope my advice should be helpful to new starters of the sport .
One of my favourite restaurants is one located in a delightful town called Ubeda .
The whole town is gorgeous and you seem to be in another age of history .
The restaurant has a characteristic decoration indeed because you seem to be inside a train .
However , the most impressive thing is the game of flavours that explode inside your mouth .
My favourite one is a golden egg made of foie .
The connection between quality and price is plenty balanced .
In fact , there are always plenty of people every day so I recommend ordering at least one week before going .
I know from personal experience that it is worth tasting the gourmet sampling menu .
I really think it is suitable for the class because each one of us could know in advance how would pay to eat there and besides this could taste the main courses of this restaurant .
Without shadow of doubt I am absolutely sure this could be the best option for our class .
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO THRILLED
I 'm not a great fun of films based od fiction , unrealistic facts and events .
I have always preferred to relax during some series or soap opera , but after watching ' Flushed ' I change my point of view .
If you haven't seen it yet , after reading this short text you 'll go to the cinema if you only have a chance .
THE BIRTH OF NEW STAR
I guess that a name Ann Smith tells you nothing .
And that 's obvious because it 's the first serious production of this young , prospective director , whose ' Flushed " became a worldwide hit .
It is said that a well - known cast enabled her to be highly granted for her piece , but I have some doubts about it .
THE STRENGHT OF SPECIAL EFFECTS
And that 's why I find this move so excited .
An enormous amount of additional attractions for viewer provided me with unforgettable feelings .
Everything came us a surprise and you did n't expect that this or that action is just taking place .
The movie requires from us to be strongly concentrated on what is going on and I find it to be one of mostly conceiving factors for those who still have some objections .
The director gives a choice to broaden our mind and to come up with our own conclusion or maybe imaginable ending of the gripping story .
RECOMMENDATONS
For me there is no better movie to be presented in our club .
Taking into consideration our interest in the field of thrillers , under no cicumstances can we miss it !
The profile of millions of recent graduate and professional people in Spain is a young person , well prepared and without work who are thinking of going abroad as a good chance to get a job .
To work abroad can offer you a good opportunity , maybe it would never happens in your own country , instead .
Furthermore , as well known , salaries are higher in other European countries than in Spain , so your life conditions may increase the same as your career ladder .
On the other hand , going abroad without your family might be a really bad experience , because you may thoroughly miss them , maybe because you are not able to visit them as much as you can due to living far away from home .
The weather may be a disadvantage , as well .
For example , if you go to work to England you can see off the bright and sunny Spanish days and say a big welcome to the frightful English weather and depression .
To sum up , the disadvantages of going abroad are higher than the advantages , but every cloud has a silver lining .
Maybe , many people who have studied did it to get a job opportunity in their own country , but life is life .
All About me
Hi ! My name is Ester , I was born in Danderyd and
I have not moved since that .
I have got one sister , she is 15 years old and her name is Tina , she is also going in Fribergaskolan .
I also have a little rabbit which is named Frippe , he is so cute and cuddly .
But my dream is to own a horse because I love riding .
On
Fridays and Saturdays I go riding at the riding center
named " Djursholms ridskola " and at Sundays I often go
to my " carer horse " , it 's like your own horse for a day ( or more ) in the week and mine is Saturdays .
My carer horse is named Wiggins but he 's called Viggo .
Viggo is a black , quite small pony .
He 's a little bit lazy but loves to run fast , so he is lazy in a smart way .
I love him and I hope he loves me back .
When I was eight years old I visited Thailand , it was wonderful and we lived at a hotel so close to the beach , I could nearly touch the sand from the pool .
We rode on Asian elephants and dived in the water .
One day we were out to three different Islands in a diving- group .
One of the islands was a cave you had to swam into it , it was very beautiful .
When we were in Thailand we saw many different animals , everything from big leguans to rainbow fishes and deadly sea - snakes .
Every year at the sport - vaccination me , my mom and my sister are going to Switzerland to go skiing in the alps , it 's wonderful and really fun .
We have never seen a marmot but I so want to .
We have went to Champéry a couple of times .
In Champéry you can ski over to France , that is awesome .
We have also went to Verbier , I loved the cabin we slept in there .
It was very big but was cozy at the same time .
Three words that describe me best is perhaps , animal lover , happy and a perfectionist ?
It 's hard to say something like that about yourself .
A weakness I would like to eliminate is that I often think or say " I do that later " and never doing it or say the same thing when it 's time to do that .
That is really annoying for my mom and others .
I like food , especially Italian food , It is my favorite food to eat .
And of Italian food I like pizza ( thin with tuna ) or some delicious pasta the most .
My favorite restaurant is " La Piazza " in Djurholm and it is of course Italian , I have actually been in Italy twice , in Rome and Florence and in a small town named Lucignano in the countryside .
I think that 's my favorite country too .
When we were there last summer , I saw an endangered and rare bird which is called Hoopoe .
It was beautiful and had like a mohawk of orange feathers on its head .
I like to read too , my favorite type of books is horse books or just random books its hard to explain but I mean , books with daily action not sciene - fiction or romantic .
Some of the books I like is named only way is up and steal the show and is written by Emmy Abrahamson , I think she is a very well author , another author I like is John Boyne who has written the terrible thing that happened to Barnaby brocket .
Right now I read a book called " the maze runner " it is very exciting .
When I grow up I want to be a vet , it 's a dream come true for me , I hope I will go to other countries like Australia and job there as a vet for a couple of years . I have never been blood scared or something like that and I would love to have a job I think is fun lifetime out .
Another dream job for me would be an art - director .
I love to design presentations and edit things at the computer but also in real life like my room , clip - art and more .
Parkour is a discipline in which its main proporse is to train your body and mind to be able to pass through a point A to point B , in any kind of environment , the safest and faster way without causing no harm to your body .
Parkour was developed in Lisses , Frace , around the 1980 's .
One of the faundations used to develop Parkour was the Natural Method created by Georges Hébert .
Basicaly , the method is based in develop the main foundations of moviment of the human body , they are : swim , run , walk , jump , quadruped moviment , climb , lift things , balance and defend yourself .
Raimond Belle was a former Vietnam souldier and worked as a fireman in the French army .
He had a great background in gymnastics and , sice he was a teenage , he used to do a lot of exercises .
The roots of Parkour was developed by him and he taught some of Parkour thechniques to the fireman which he used to work with .
His son , David Belle , was taught some of the faundations of Parkour too .
David and a group of friends tried to adapt this techniques to the urban environment and then the actual Parkour was born .
Some people say that David criated Parkour but , in fact , his father develop all the idea of the discipline .
David adapted it to the urban environment and created new moves .
Parkour is n't just a physical discipline , there is also the philosofical part . Altruism , " be strong to be useful " ( it is actually a frase Natural Method ) , develop your body and mind so that in a dangerous situation you will be able to save yourself and other people and so on .
Therefore , is due to its philosofy and the joy that I fell before , during and after a train , this is why Parkour is my favorite exercise .
Nowadays our society has become very lazy due to the use of the car or the motorbike .
There are less people who use the public transport in the city because they prefer travelling by car rather than in public transport .
For this reason , the use of public transport is going down , and some experts say that there is no future for the public transport .
For lot of people , travel by your own car is more comfortable than travel by public transport like bus or metro , because you do not depend on a schedule , that it is very common when you take public transport .
Conversely , when you travel by your own car , you save a lot of time during the journey .
However , public transport has also advantages .
On the one hand , public transport affords you to waste money , because the price of the ticket is not very expensive .
On the other , travelling by metro or bus pollute less than going by car .
The reason is that when you use the car , you normally go on your own and when you travel by metro or car lot of people are travelling at the same time as you .
In my opinion , there are more people who travel by car every day , even for short journeys .
For me , people have become very lazy and they prefer the car rather than puiblic transport , because you can take the car when you want and go where you want whotout spending hours waiting for the bus .
The consequence of this is that in the near future the public transport will disappear .
The company ensures the quality of water from production to distribution .
The product will be registered with Ministry of Helath and SriLanka standerds Association and adhere their rules and regulatiuon for production , storing and distribution .
We will not compromise the quality of the production process or the product for any cost .
The company will ensure that , the low negative environmental impact due to the production process .
The company will set the retail price same as other bottled water products in market .
But we will give a good price to retailers and hotels to sell our products more in market .
The direct supplies to offices , households and hotels also will be given good price with the delivery service .
We will rent water dispensers with a maintenance services to required customers in future to attract more customers .
During the last century , our way of life has changed completely , even in villages .
For example , cars are the main kind of transport because of this most of the families have more than one in their houses .
However , changes always has a negative side .
According to the last studies , pollution increases this year in the biggest cities whereas it goes down in villages .
On the other hand , cities are more worried about how to recycle their rubbish than in villages .
To resolve this trouble , my village has created a plan to teach its population how important it is to take care of the environment and how to do it .
For this reason , we have new containers to separate all rubbish : we have to throw away bottles , cans and cartons into the yellow ; paper and cardboard go to the blue and there is another one for glass .
Food and other things are thrown into the green container .
The council also has put over one hundred bins around the village to keep clean our streets .
At the school , children are learning how to spend less water or electricity at home .
Turn off the lights when you do n't stay in a room or do not waste water while you are brushing your teeth are some of advice .
I hope these simple actions can be used for other people because the environment needs that we work together for a better world .
Let me introduce our city curiosity .
Our town is often connected with Tomáš Baťa .
He made our town well known and he had a shoe factory built here .
Name of the factory is Baťa .
How interesting !
Anyway , he built a skyscraper , which is called 21 .
And what is inside that building ?
There are some offices .
But that 's not the most interesting thing !
Tomáš Baťa had own office , but do you know what is a little bit strange ?
His office is built as a lift !
But that 's great !
He had to control his employees and this way did n't take him so much time .
But that 's not all ...
When you get on the last floor , there 's a large terrace and cafe .
You can see a beautiful panorama of our town .
It 's an unforgettable experience .
You can offer a delicious coffee , tea or cake and you can watch the beauty .
It may not be your cup of tea , but I think it 's the most interesting and beautiful place in our town . I 'm looking forward to see you !
When visiting Copenhagen during summer time there is a huge variety of shops and restaurants that will give you a sense of the Copenhagen lifestyle .

Do we need fashion ?
Fashion , a popular topic .
We all wear clothes , do we ?
And most people think about what they wear , although some do n't care about there clothing .
What happens when we all just have to wear the same clothes ?
Do we really need fashion ?
I talked about this topic with a few other students and asked them what there opinion is .
In the following paragraphs I 'll tell you what they told me .
The first question we discussed was : ' Does it exist just to make money for clothing designers and manufactures ? '
Their opinios first varied a bit here .
An argument some called was:'In case we remove this whole industry , then there would be an humangous group of peoole unemployed , and that would be a problem . '
The others answered on this with the question : ' When does a company starts making something , just because they want something to do ? '
This question made the other group doubt a bit , they did agree that a company does n't just start making something to have something to do .
This made them all agree that fashion is there for a reason , and not only for money .
Next question we talked about the following question:'Does it have too much effect on models ? ' They did n't have to think about their opinion , they all directly said ' Yes ' .
They told that if you wanted to be a model , you had to fit in a size of clothing which is really small .
There is immense group of girls who really want to be a model , caused by the fact that they do n't fit in this clothing yet they have to lose weight .
Much girls are losing too much weight right then because they want to be ' perfect ' and got anorexia and those things .
The following question which we talked about was:'Does it have too much influence on young people ? '
Here they all directly responded with a ' yes ' too .
In their opinion young people , also themselves , were very busy with fashion and clothes .
An example on which they all agreed was:'In case you just met your new class , and you had to choose next to who you had to sit the most people were going to sit next to the girl or boy with the trendy clothes ' .
Some said that it even happened that people just bought a particular kind of clothing , just because they thought they would have more friends then .
The next question was:'Does it make society materialistic and competitive ?
The students were a bit doubting but agreed on the fact that people who have stylish clothes are usually the most popular .
And there 're a lot of people who want to be popular , so they are going to buy trendy clothing .
The last and probably the most difficult question we discussed was:'Does it affect the way you dress and the kinds of clothes you buy ? '
They all said it kind of did affect however they also bought clothes they liked .
I asked them the question:'If you liked a piece of clothing but your friends did n't , would you then have bought it ? '
They all said yes , but with a little doubt .
So , we do kind of need fashion .
But where do we decide on which clothes we wear ?
And do you have to like your clothes or someone else ?
Maybe we should keep in mind that we should wear clothes in which we feel okay .
It was a lovely and sunny day .
I was gardening since the beginning of the morning , when the postman arrived .
At that moment , my dog was kidding with a ball that was small and green .
The postman took the letter from his bag , and then , gave me the letter .
I was so surprised !
I was not expect any letter .
Suddenly , I felt so nervous and I did not know why .
That letter has changed my whole life .
I totally do not agree with the statement that there is no future for public transportation because of car existences .
General public are using the public transportation more than before .
students who are not allowed to drive still using the public transportation and they will always do .
Moreover , the traffics on areas such as down town enforced people to use the public transportation as train , since the trains are faster .
Insurances are so expensive in north America , most of householder are not using the car because of insurance , and also because of adding cost as fixing the cars , changing car oils and etc .
Furthermore , Government are enhancing the public transportation by services they are providing with lower cost . the fair for raid in public transportation are more less than the cost of driving the car at the same distance .
Finally , none will argue that the benefit of using cars over public transportation , but that does not excluded the public transportation .
Hi Paul ,
how are you ? I hope that everything is all right .
I am writing as I promised .
The concert was great !
The best I 've ever been to .
Although I was watching it from backstage , the atmosphere was the same as I 'd have been watching it in front of the stage together with other fans .
There is a lot of work during the concert preparation .
We had to check if everything is correct : sound , light , special effects .
Besides , we have to watch if the band have everything that they need : something to eat and to drink , I was responsible for it .
It was the hardest thing !
I had to satisfy all of whims of the stars .
It was an unforgettable experience . I will never forget it .
The opportunity to meet your idols in real was the most exciting .
I will tell you everything when we meet !
Hugs and kisses ,
Ania

Vacation is what we have waited for three long months of hard studies , homework , tests and more .
Even though we have finished the term exams , they have just given us a week free .
I did not do everything I wanted because I was forced by my parents to go to Boquete .
The day we finished our last exam , I was not sure what to do . First a friend was not talking to me , because someone told her a lie , so we went to yogen fruz to talk , then I went to the gym and walked to Gabo 's house and then Dani 's .
From there we went to the mall and for last to Juanca 's house .
Friday , I spent the day with my mom and later I went to a friend 's house with Juanca , Oliver , and others .
Saturday I helped a friend with his party and made 64 dollars .
Sunday I went to the mall with the same people .
The group is named Hogwarts
From Monday till Friday I was in .
Boquete where I did nothing and Saturday I came back .
That night I went to Oz with my friends till 2 in the morning .
The last day I went to Nashla 's pool and ordered 50 chicken wings .
I did not do much
The summary of my vacations is that the time I spent with friends I had a good time but when I was with my family y got bored .
I do n't know if you remember the Nastaran thing .
But the same as I thought you 'd never love me for much long time , if you could ever do it , I always thought that Nastaran would be the girl of my life , if there were any .
But I lost her after a little kiss from the cheek in the first date .
Of course after that I never thought that I ever had the chance .
But once one of her friends told me that before the kiss , everything was to be ok .
And I believed her .
And since then it 's the most pain .
I know it may seem as a meanness of her .
But it was n't .
Tonight she got the admission from Harvard .
Since I have a specific feeling by now , I thought of sharing it with you .
I miss sharing things with you .
And I used the English 'cause it would be more spoiled in Farsi .
Belarus is not a popular tourist destination nowadays but a lot of people would be surprised to find real medieval atmosphere in Grodno , a western city of the country .
Founded in the 12th century , it came through all important events of Eastern Europe history , from Tatar invasions till the World War II which was a real disaster .
Two ancient castles remind us of the times of kings and nobility , quiet pedestrian streets show us the life as it could be in the 1800s .
Grodno is situated on the crossroads of great trading ways that 's why one could hear Polish , Jewish , German , Lithuanian there .
Its multiethnic population was the reason to organise and held the Festival of national cultures every two years .
It 's worth visiting because traditions of the ancient Belarusian , Tatar , Russian , Jewish shown alive make us feel history itself .
City of different religions , different nationalities and " talking stones " is waiting for you .
REPORT ON SHOPPING FACILITIES IN MY TOWN
The reason Lagos remains a mega city is because of its abundant tourist centers .
The beautiful seaside and natural games reserve or Zoo makes it very attractive to tourist visitors .
A pleasurable tourism is not complete without a fascinating shopping center that has several facilities .
ATTRIBUTES OF SHOPPING FACILITIES
There are lots of shopping centers in my town with their own unique characteristics .
These include facilities like ample vehicle parking lots with very low charges or almost free of charge , elevator systems to access any area of the shopping malls in the case of carrying very heavy loads of purchases and relaxation spots like Cinemas and gaming centers for kids .
In addition , most shopping malls do have enough space for their customers to move around without getting any clustering of people ; as this is a statutory requirement to building a shopping mall .
SHOPPING RECOMMENDATIONS
As a matter of fact , Shop - rite is one of the best place in my opinion , that I would advise people to visit .
It products are more international and they offer a lot of discounts to tourist visitors .
Besides , this shop is not too far from the known natural games reserve in Lekki area of Lagos .
Another shopping center is the magnificent Lagos Island market .
This is where you would find several shops that sell most African traditional artifact .
I will rather advice tourist to pay this market a visit to enable them have choices of priceless products .
CONCLUSION
I hope from the explanations , I have been able to convince you with respect to my opinion about the shopping centers in my town and their possible facilities that abounds as you take your time in considering visiting them .
In developed countries , four wheels gain high appreciation in everyday transportation .
In capital cities of Europe one can easily notice how many people prefer their own means instead of the pushing crowd of public transportation .
It is however well known after a plethora of scientific publications that cars harm the environment dramatically .
On the other hand , modern citizens like to be part of green revolution and carbon footprint has an effect in everyday decision making .
Many organizations and public authorities encourage workers to use public means of transport to and from the job place in order to minimize greenhouse gases emissions and save natural resources .
As a result , before private transportation reaches its pick for 21st century , it is more probably green mobility overlaps it and dominates in people choice .
There is great future for public transport , same for bicycling and on foot travelling instead of cars and other polluting machines .
Dear Harry ,
I have just received your letter .
I 'm pretty excited to be in London from the 11th .
I 'm arriving at the train station in the morning at 6 o'clock .
Do n't be afraid not to recognise me because I haven't changed a lot in two years , but for your confidence I will be with a bright orange suitcase .
I 'm waiting for meeting with your family and in this case that we will be staying with Eileen , I want to bring her something .
What can it be ?
I would like to visit Big Ben Tower and many other places that you will propose , but I do n't really want to see common tourist sights , so if you could show me something that not everyone can find , I would appreciate that .
Write to me as soon as possible .
Yours ,
Ann .
Best places to young people visit in New York ?
I am doubtless it is an easy task : here you can visit many entertaining facilities , where you can find technology or culture , for example , and there are also many places to eat , dance , etc .
The Statue of Liberty is by far the most famous building at the city .
The great view it provides is incredible .
The Times Square is a good site for buying too , although the excessive quantity of advertisement is a little bit annoying .
Finally , the Metropolitan Museum of Art is a good place for people who like history , antropology and viewing a lot of types of arts .
Talking about places to eat or dance , near the Grand Station you can find the ' Num Pang ' , a good place to eat sandwich .
Remarkably , teenagers like eating this and it is where you can find one of the best .
Around the Central Park , there is one of my favourite bakery : '
The Bouchon ' .
Many types of candy and cakes can be found there .
If you need more information , please tell me .
Have a good travel !
I utterly agree with the statement : travelling by car is much more convenient , because you can go wherever you want without waiting for a bus or train at a bus stop or station .
I think that travelling by car is also more inner and comfortable because you only travel with people you know .
Talking about money probably car is more convenient , even if you have to pay for fuel , highway and everything that is necessary to the maintenance of the car .
As a result , if you use public transport , you have to pay an expensive subscription and different tickets .
There is no future for public transport because buses and trains are broken and dirty and people prefer to avoid them .
So people prefer travelling with their own means of transport instead of paying to travel in a terrible way .
On the other hand , if we do n't use public transport and every person use a car , pollution will increase a lot .
We can also say that with cars you have to find a parking , so you can waste time and sometimes pay for that .
Eventually we should use public transport to reduce pollution , but they have to be more checked and repaired .
I agree with the statement , fmous people deserve to have a private life without life jouralists following them all the time .
Fame is a choice of many people , it was their dream .
But it does n't mean they haven't got some rights to have private life .
Many of them have got family members , who do n't want to have anything in common with fame .
Usually journalists also following them all the time .
It 's very important to remember if you 're famous , you should protect your family .
Sometimes happens , that journalists write some silly gosspis about famous people , which are not true .
It may be a danger for family of a celebrity , politician , famous person , because of them some could broke up .
But on the other hand , being famous is a free choice for many people .
They want to be rich and famous and they know , that journalist will be follow them .
But sometimes it does n't depend on us .
If you 're a queen , member of royal family , from your birth you 'll be observing by press and magazines .
It 's a price of being famous .
Altought it does n't mean , that press should write about privacy .
Public activity is one of the most important thing .
In my opinion , the television has an important role in the society because it can influence in people 's life .
I mean people watch television to entertain themselves but others maybe watch it to learn a new language with different programs that television offers or just put subtitles to make it simple .
A lot of important news can be shown to people around the world by TV .
It 's important to know what it 's happening in the world because it can enrich your knowledge culturally , politically , etc .
Besides you need to know if a conflict is developing at the moment or if many severe situations are being occurred in your country .
Children learn a lot of things with cartoons , it can help them to improve the speaking and to know new vocabulary .
The television is one of the most important media .
So , for that reason I think television can entertain and also educate .
I 'd like to add that television can be the refuge of a person if it 's sad or the break of someone 's on its free time .
Watching TV can be funny and nice but watching it in excess can be bad and not healthy for your life .
I always believe I can become an engineer and computer technician to invent more things since I was small .
After I receive more and more information about some successful engineer and inventor such as Steve Jobs , I realize that no matter who you are and how smart you are , you can not live without a healthy body .
Consequently , I believe physical development is the necessity in secondary school life and I was so grateful for providing me opportunities of extra - curricular activities .
I like the feeling of getting sweat and a great passion in swimming .
Therefore , to maintain my body healthy and my interest , I keep on joining the School Aquathon since I was secondary one . I participated the same events each year .
It allows me know my body state and whether I have relapsed .
Besides it gave me a motion to train harder and never have a thinking of giving up that I need to keep my swimming training every year and reminds me of the importance of a healthy body .
Also , under the harsh training , it trains my willpower and setting goal .
I learnt setting a proper goal as it is a significant factor to success .
This goal push me forward to do better and better each time .
I realized that you will make a concession if you do not improve after take part in School Aquathon and saw others got improved but not just me .
I reckon learning and trying more kinds of things can change my school life to become more colorful .
School work and examinations gave me huge pressure so I found a way to strike a balance that I learnt playing windsurfing .
In my eyes , windsurfing is special and indispensable to me .
When I step on the surfing board , all my vexation and misgiving were gone .
Under the recommendation of my instructor , I joined the Joint school windsurfing competition .
On that day I found something wrong with my position on the result board . I was shocked and decided protest for the wrongdoings of the race committee .
After several meetings , I got my position back and I have learnt that we should believe ourselves .
Also I got trained my body and become more healthy .
The hottest issue nowadays is the global warming .
Therefore I paid more attention at global warming and ways to deal with it .
It is part of my dream that I wish I can have an invention to solve the problem in the future .
To know more information having a green lifestyle , I participated in the Green & Organic Health Run 2013 .
Also , I learnt communication skills with friends .
One of the purpose of this event is to encourage running to have a healthy lifestyle , so I got a better physical development .
To have more different experience , I have joined the " Dialogue in the dark " experiential exhibition .
In the total dark environment , I experience the feeling of the visually disabled and the difficulties of their livings .
After undergo this experience , I can totally understand their needs and I got my new goal of helping them in the future .
I get a greater passions in engineering so as to create some device to help them to have a more comfortable life .
Also I have learnt the communication skills with others and be considerate .
Under the colorful school life , I undergo different type of experience and I finally set my career goal to become an engineer or a computer technician .
I think it is not a good engineer who only got skills of engineering .
Therefore I reckon my experience can trained me to be admitted as a suitable candidate of engineering and I will work hard to achieve my goal .
People differ from each other and everyone have various professions .
Being a politician or a filmstar has something in common : those people are famous .
And , as a draback of being acelebrity , they are followed by papparazzi almost everywhere .
But do n't they deserve to have more private life ?
I think that journalists should remember about the private life of famous people which is deserved to stay in secret for other people .
There are a lot of cases known when journalists would make it difficult for a celebrity to leave some place because there were so many of those journalists .
And for some people it does n't really matter if it was found out that someone was in a bar for example as long as their films are really worth watching .
Besides , being foollowed by unknown people ought to be quite a scary experience .
Some people would say that it 's necessary for usual people to know how the politician lives so they could know if he should be trusted .
That 's for sure an important thing to know for voters .
But as for film stars , is it really necessary to know how exactly they live ?

It is a fact that the public is getting worse year by year specially here in Peru , however we have to think about the benefits that public transport has , for instance it can be a cost - effective way to get to work , so there will be no space for public transport in the future ?
Hundreds of people take buses at any time , one of the main reason for this is that they have not got their own car .
As a result , not only is public transport the option they have , but it is also the only one .
It 's known that over the years the system have improved and new means of transport have been offered such as trains and trolleys all of them with just one objective to transport a mass of people at a quick time .
On the other hand the number people who can afford a car and the cost that it involves have gone up over the last few years and one of the main reasons they have it because of the comfort , also they claim that they can get their work faster than public transport .
Michael sat in the bus and take out his dairy to calculate how much he have to invest in the tennis court .
A girl came and sat in the seat next to him .
She asked him when the bus is going to depart but Michael replied that he was also not aware of the departure time .
The bus starts after half an hour and Michael start talking with his parents over the phone and discussed his business .
The strange girl who was sitting next to him was listening to music and looking outside trying to ignore the details that Michael was sharing with his parents .
It was a 13 hour journey and the girl wanted to talk with Michael and so she offered chips but he denied .
After some time the bus stopped for 5 min and Michael bought two chocolates , chips and a soft drink and offered her a chocolate .
The girl accepted the chocolate with a smile and asked him where he was going ?
This is how they start their conversation and while exchanging conversation , they felt as if they know each other for a long time ... they got attracted towards each other and in the midst of that they kissed each other and even exchanged phone numbers .
Their bus was about to reach their destination next morning so Michael offered her to drop at home and the girl agreed with a smile .
At that time they felt not like parting but they have to and Michael dropped her home and returned back to his own home .
After returning home , Michael flash backed what he did in the bus .
Michael took a deep breath and look at the entrance door that was still open .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Dear Sir :
I am writing with regard to an advertisement that appeared in the local newspaper recently .
This advertisement requeste a group of young people to work in summer camps all over the USA .
First of all , my name is Lorena and I have twenty - three years old and I am from Spain and I would like to job in your summer camp because I can improve my English level and earn money ; my English level is so good due to all this year I have been in English academy to learn the language and now I am going to take another certificate ; and just like that I will be able to communicate with children .
Secondly , last year I stayed in a beach summer camp and there were children aged 6 - 13 , besides my partner and I prepared water activities when the weather was good , against ; when the weather was bad we prepared puzzles games , adventure games , etc .
The advertisement talks about work in the kitchens ; our summer camp was little because it was in a small town so we had to cook children food and I could do it without problems .
I look forward to hearing your response .
Yours faithfully .
Lorena .
Michale will never forget the day as long as he lived .
It was on Saturday morning around 10.30 .
He went to the church on that day .
It was the Seventh day Adventist church which the ritual was to worship on Saturday .
He was there not because he was a Christian , but his presence was because of a girl he had a crush on .
Honestly , as eight years old boy who knows Christianity close to nothing , his knowledge of Christianity was lower than a 3 year - old child .
Anxiousness got the better of him as he prepare himself to enter the sanctuary .
In his mind , the only reason I was there was just to see the girl he had my crush on and to know some of her church friends .
The boy had to push himself and break the ice as the time went by .
Uhhh , I am starting to get lazy .
WHATTTT I MISSPELLED MICHAEL!!Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Public transport means travelling around the world and cities by using trains , buses , taxi , airplanes etc .
Some years ago people believed that private cars would be the main vehicle to move around but nowadays , due to economic crisis , most of the people have changed their minds ; they believe that public transport would be the main way to move around in the future for many reasons .
First of all , travelling by cars is more expensive than travelling by public transport ; cars should pay for gas , insurance , repairing , environmnet fees etc ; travelling by public transport is more ecological and cheaper .
Secondly , people who use public transport are safer than others who use private cars ; if they drink more than usual and drive their cars ; there are a lot car accidents due to drivers are drunk .
Finally , the traffic jam is much less if people use public transport than using private cars ; the developed countries have built a public transport system so to avoid traffic jam , why people not using it ?
In conclusion , public transport will not be affected by using private cars .
I strongly believe that in the near future public transport will be the main vehicle to travel around the world , safe and cheap .
Michael had just woken up , he felt a Little bit thirsty so he went to the kitchen for fresh water .
He saw his brother watching TV as usual .
As he could n't sleep anymore he dressed up and brought his brother to the park .
His mother would be probably working , she was a realtor and would be selling a house .
It was a windy day so they kept their jackets and scarf .
When Michael and his little brother , Jackson , arrived at the park , noticed that there was n't anybody around .
The park was sealed by a green tape which said " danger zone keep away " .
Suddenly two people dressed as astronauts were leaving the park and advertised to the young boys to go to their house and wait until these unfortunately event was over .
Tom and Jack were curious about what had happened but they did n't know from were to take answers .
While they were walking back home they heard a journalist commenting what incident have happened to the park .
The only thing they could clearly heard was : - But this can only be caused by the contamination , although these windy day hasn't helped .
Jackson stopped walking and get distracted by a beautiful dog , Michael continued on his way unaware Jackson was n't following him .
Almost arriving at home and mulling over the thoughts take his own conclusions to what could might have happened .
And wanted to share them with jack but ...
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Well , I think what this guy is trying to say is that it does n't matter if you have thousands of friends on Facebook if you do n't even know half of them .
What I think it 's stupid is that most people use to hide their faces from behind the screen and no one wants to appreciate a sunny day anymore !
What I disagree about this video is because he is generalizing too much .
I think it is cool to have a social network , and there is nothing wrong to let kids enjoy the technology that became part of our generation .
However , they must be controlled and especially by their parents .
I believe the old values should have been taught for children in schools .
The thing nowadays is , if you disconnect from all of the things we have , people make fun of you and say that you are old or just do n't know how to deal with the modern world .
Well , it is possible actually , just like we did in the 1990s .
I 've experienced this , so that 's why I am saying .
The internet has caused me depression once , I felt really alone and I used to be someone who I was n't in the real life , but I learned how to deal with it .
I am afraid more people pass through for the same thing
Some people like shopping .
Some people love shopping and some people can not live without shopping .
I Am from the first type of people .
I like shopping .
I care about fashion a little bit , so sometimes I go on a shopping spree and I spend a lot of money in some clothes shop .
But somebody has to go with me , because it would be boring with nobody .
Shopping with someone would be great .
After that , we can go at cafe and take some good coffee .
A lot of brands are generally good .
Some of brands are excellent and really cool in my city .
For example H&M. It is brilliant shop .
There are all of styles of clothes .
Sportswear , elegant clothes and of course accessories .
Everyone can find right his styles , so I recommend it .
In the summer time , Milan offers a variety of facilities and services , especially for young people .
Visiting the centre of the city is really fascinating : Piazza del Duomo is one of the most suggestive squares in Italy with the particularity of the white marble facade of the Dome and his multitude of pinnacles .
The surroundings are dedicated to the fashion : you can find the most important shops for whom Milan is known in the whole world .
In the same area , people often have the chance to attend free concerts of Italian singers and some foreign artists .
The Sforzesco Castle is another suggestive historic monument and the green Sempione park is one of the best place where people can practise sport or can attend a yoga class in the middle of the wildlife .
Finally people can experiment the Milanese nightlife in the area of the Navigli , which are really crowded from 19 till late .
Here you can experience the typical Milanese aperitif , during which you can have a cocktail while eating whatever you want and you can get to know many young people .
Thriller name : Killer shadow
The review :
Jack Pollard a street fighter known as Crazy dog lives downtown LA .
He has enemies who want to kill him .
One night when he is walking aimlessly in a privacy alley he sees a shadow which gradually comes to him .
At first he does n't care but suddenly sees it in front , an owner - less shadow .
He turns his head around to find the source of shadow but ca n't find anything so he feels fear but controls himself and yells : who are you ?
Hey if it 's a kidding , stop it , it 's not funny .
Suddenly , shadow covers him and crazy dog falls on the ground and dies .
The police announced checkout is the murder motivation .
A detective named James Reilly wants to find out the reason for murder and to arrest murderer .
He realizes crazy dog killed an innocent man named Joe Mendez last year but his body was not found .
In Mendez house in the suburb , Reilly found some old photos showing the sequel of criminals .
They all were tortured viciously before death .
It was around 9 PM when Reilly was there .
Suddenly he hears a weak voice whispering ; do not try to stop the shadow , let it kill the criminals or you 'll die .
He checks everywhere but ca n't find anyone .
He sees a shadow out of the house and follows it until it stands at the end of graveyard .
He goes there and sees a pile of garbage quickly brushes aside it and observes a hole in the ground .
He goes inside it and discovers a half decayed body that was compatible with Mendez identities .
He understands that the shadow was ghost of Mendez who wanted to take revenge on Mendez 's murderer .
I think this thriller is exciting because it shows a ghost with killing ability .
I think since this idea is creative people will like to watch it .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
She knew what does that it meant , Jason was alive .
She kwew that he will be staying away for so long but she will wait .

She could n't stop smiling because she had just noticed that she would n't be alone anymore
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to describe the shopping facilities in Pamplona , and to outline some recommending shops that might appeal tourists with different interests .
Shopping Facilities
As might have been expected , a main city as Pamplona is well equipped to deal with a large number of tourist and residents going shopping .
Within the town centre itself there is a wide selection of stores offering local crafts , fashion clothing , food or wine .
In addition , several car parks have space for 2000 automobiles and are conveniently located on the centre with easy access and cheap rates .
There is also an extensive local bus network in order to provide services to all the suburbs around the city .
Special shops
Although most tourists come to Pamplona for the famous festival of " Bulls Running on the street " , many become passionite about the cuisine of Navarra . As a result , a few shops such as " LA VINOTECA " and " DELICIUS " have dedicated to selling selected top wines and typical food .
Both shops are located in " Castillo Square " and their staff speak English .
Moreover , a store known as " KUXUMUSU " offers all kinds of bulls - related souvenirs and genuine pieces that explain the Basque Country 's culture .
Recommendations for tourists
I would strongly recommend that any tourist , no matter about their interest , should visit the special shops aforementioned .
There is little doutbt that they will not only find original products , but will also enrich their minds .
Famous people should realize that if they try to gain famous all the time and waste their time on it , they will not have their own private life .
But they are surprised .
In my opinion , celebrities should remember that if they want to be famous they , probably , will be chased by paparazzi .
On the other hand , they are still normal peolple , who have families , partners and friends and they sometimes want to have a few private minutes , without cameras , media , newspapers , flashes and spotlights .
Probably , they want to go on holidays without recognise by other people , without giving autographs and taking photos .
Moreover , from time to time they prefer to leave house without make up and beautiful clothes .
Wahat is more , I am sure , that most of them do it on purpose because their main aim is the famuos .
And celebrities well know that they have to be controversial cause that is the best way to achieve their lovely famous .
So big names try to go somewhere without guards , without make ups to show themselves to cause some juicy gossip about them to gain famous in the easiest way .

What is fame ?
How is it to be famous ?
How the famous people feel and what they miss ?
Do they deserve their private lives ?
Of course they do .
I absolutely agree with the statement .
Everyone deserves his own privacy , own peace , time just for him and famous people too .
I understand , they are rich , their lives might seem interesting , even more interesting than ours , but they are not so different , they are not better than us , ordinary people .
Many of journalist or photographers think when they write some gossip about politicians or when they take some " curios " photos , it 's ok .
But it 's not .
They may hurt these people , they may ruined their life just using a bad word .
It must be really stressed when you ca n't come anywhere without journalists following you .
And also it must be really uncomfortable for friends or family who go with you .
It is a big pressure .
Of course some of famous people might like this feeling that they are so likely and favourite and they , who do n't like it they have a posibility to protect their privacy better or more or pretend that journalist following them do n't exist .
If I am honest , I have to say , I would not be famous if I would lose my life .
I like my student life without followers .
My town is a very good town for taking care of the environment .
My town , City X , is a very green city .
Only cool and good cars are allowed .
People will be fined if they throw garbage on the streets .
This town is a very strict town .
Our town is full of green plants everywhere : in the school playground , between the roads and many other places .
My town uses only uses electric cars because they do n't dive out carbon dioxide .
Smoking is not allowed .
Farting in the open air is not permitted .
Plastic substances should be reused .
Plastic bags should be bought in shops .
Most people use leather or fabric bags for their everyday life .
Dogs are also not allowed because they fart and are not clean .
People with dogs will be sentenced and will suffer heavy consequences .
People who smoke will be jailed for 20 years .
City X helps reforestation in many countries and places such as Brazil , Java , Sumatra , Peru , Guyana , French Guyana , Surinam , Bolivia , Uruguay , Paraguay , Colombia , Venezuela , Equador , Chile , Indonesia , Bali , Malaysia , Singapore , India , and many more .
Public transport is going to face a huge decrease in the near future .
New technologies are changing the way of thinking private cars in a new much more save and ecological way .
On the one hand , public transport is well known by their large amount of benefices like less pollution and more economical aspects .
Moreover , large crowded cities using underground or bus are usually a good way to avoid traffic jams , saving time and stress of sad drivers during commutations .
For that reason , fomenting the use of public transport has been the main concern of most of modern governments .
On the other hand , huge technological improvements in car features like self - driving , electrical engines , solar power and others , have created a new perspective of conceiving the way we interact with cars .
Usually , cars need one hundred percent of our attention during driving . Resulting as a huge disadvantage of cars compared to public transport because we are not able to enjoy driving time by doing something else at the same time we are driving .
However , that is really close to change by Google 's Self - Drive Car which is a new technology able to drive our car to any destination without humane intervention .
Furthermore , the car could be empty and go anywhere we command .
That exiting news open a new world of possibilities for the use of cars .
For instance , imagine going to work and order the car going to park home after take your children at school .
In addition , many other improvements like electric engines from Tesla are getting new benefices to this new concept of Intelligent - Cars .
To summarise , cars are going to be so independent , ecological , cheep and intelligent that we will never take a public transport again .
My name is Tove .
I like to play soccer , dance and sing . I like to dance because I can do a little bit whatever I want when I dance and only a few people is judging me .
I like singing because it can bring happiness .
I like to play soccer because I get to hang out with friends and train at the same time .
My favorite food is sushi , and my favorite drink is a pink drink with Pineapple in it . I like sushi because it is fresh and sweet and at the same time it is sour .
The drink is so good because it has a lot of sweet flavors and it has pineapple in it .
I want a kitten but my mom is allergic so we ca n't have one .
I was born in July 25th 2003 .
I have a brother named Markus who wants to be a professional tennis player when he gets older , he is 17 years old .
My mom 's name is Katarina and she likes to sing , she turns 50 this year .
Her favorite food is crab and her favorite drink is a good white wine .
My dad 's name Björn and he likes Tang So Do and to swim , he is 52 years old .

Dear Paul ,
we did n't seen for a while so you do n't know much about me lately .
Last month I was training at a concert by decorated the scene and seriously came out better then I expected to .
The bulbs were red and the ground was full of yellow flowers .
Seems simple but looks beautiful , sometimes the simplicity is the most perfect accessorise .
I was happy helping those people , because money from the tickets were donated to a nursing house .
Nowadays people care more about themeselves and making good things for some of them is wrong !
I 'm sad when I see a nursing house but you know , there , people will never talk whether they do bad or good and in the end of the day , they will not care only about themselves and their insecurity .
Being there is like having your own family .
I hope , in the next project you 'll be there helping us !
We need more caring person !
Dear Jo ,
I am really happy you write to me for some advice and I am very honourated that you want to spend some time in my country .
Now you have got lots of free time and I think that you must make a really good tour of my country .
Firstly you have to decide if you want to visit the North or the South part of Itlay because if you do a full immertion tour of the intire Peninsula you visit neither a half of all you have to visit .
If you decide to visit the North part I think is good if you start from Trento and his new museum about nature called Muse .
It is very beautiful because it is structured like a mountain ( and so you can start from the last floor and then you go down visiting other floors ) .
Then you must visit my city , Milan .
There you must see the center of the city because we have the Dome ( the Church ) , the gallery near the Dome , the little hidden church called S.Satiro and , at the end , the Sforza 's castle .
Then you must visit Venice the city on the water where every part of the city is a little treasure .
If you like the Egyptian story you can go to Tourin where you can find a huge and beautiful museum about Ancient Egypt .
If you want to visit the South part of Italy you must start your trip from Florence , the bithplace of the culture , then you must go down to Rome the capital city of my country .
After that you have seen the Coliseum , the Basilic of S.Peter and the Trevi fountain and so on you must visit Naples .
In that wonderful city you must visit the statue of Jesus Christ called " il Cristo velato " made by marble and then you must visit the centre of the city , full of fantastic features that make this city really particular like Spaccanapoli , Hidden Napoli , S.Gennaro 's treasure , S.Severio Church and so on .
If you are a little bit tired of all this trip you can go to Sicily where a beautiful and special landscape can welcome you .
There ale lots of things to visit in Sicily and the most important cities are : Palermo , Messima , Siracusa , Noto , Ragusa , Trapani , Agrigento ..
The idea to find a job that lasts thre month is great ..
I think you could work as an entretainer in some tourist villages roun the country .
In that way you colud improve your way to make a relationship with people and also it could be a great help for your theatrical experience .
I know that you are a brilliant photographer and that you want to improve your hability , so I think that you could do some photos during your trip and then you could send them to some experts .
Honestly I think that it could be hard ( just because you haven't so much time ) but I know that sooner or later there will be a photo event ... It 's not much but you can start from it to let other people know about your talent .
I hope that my advices will help you and I also hope that you have a great time in my country ! !
Let me know if you enjoy yout tour and take lots of photos ( I want to see them soon )
Lots of kisses

Nowadays , people have different viewpoints about whether the most principle concern of choosing an occupation is salary .
Personally , I disagree with that the money is the most important consideration for deciding a job , because there are several factors equally important .
I believe that other considerations are as important as money .
Firstly , the core values and the reputation of the company are necessarily concerned .
Working in a company which is built up with good core values and has an excellent reputation could easily obtain the fulfillment and keep passion in job for a long time .
We would believe that this job is worth contributing to for life .
Secondly , the co - worker relationship and the atmosphere in the workplace are extremely important when choosing a job .
Having a kind boss or friendly colleagues , for example , can bring workers the senses of belonging and enjoyment from working , hence the working quality may arise greatly .
Admittedly , money is necessary for people 's daily lives , satisfying their basic demand .
For example , the expenditure of food , drinks and commodities need the support from the steady income .
Furthermore , we may need much more money to have some activities , such as worldwide travel or outdoor camping for days .
In addition , in the life - long consideration , health - care would be increasingly important with people getting older , hence enough amount of money as a stable income could not be disregard .
In conclusion , while salary still plays a role and certainly affects people 's choice of profession , I believe that money does not outweigh all the other factors .
Karate gave me a new purpose of life .
This is one reason why it is my most favorite sport .
There are various reasons why I am absolutely fascinated by this martial art .
Behind every single movement you will find gracefulness and power .
Once entering a class , you are able to fully concentrate on the sport .
There are certain procedures in the beginning of a class which encourages you to empty your mind and be ready for class .
Especially in our hectic world it is very important to find to yourself and just listen to your body .
As a martial artist you start to get a great fitness and your balance will improve a lot as well as your flexibility .
Many characteristics will increase immensely such as confidence , self - defense or responsibility .
You will find that you will not only benefit from those in your normal life , but also in your job .
Karate can be started by anyone and any age .
However to see any improvements you should attend regularly and at least twice a week .
Only then it starts to make great fun and you certainly will not regret that you have taken it up . Enjoy ! !
Good Morning :
I 'm writing to apply for one of yours advertisement publised in the local newspaper last week .
I mean , the " Usa Summer Camps " .
I 'm 31 years old , and I have had the priviledge of working as a teacher all my live , so I am an experienced person capable of taking care children .
Due to my experience as a teacher I am sure that I could have any difficulty in organising sports and inventing a wide range of activities in order to entertain children .
As well as , take part in activities about cookering .
In addition to this , I bear in mind to improve my English through my work and of this way be able to teach the children some basic skill about this universal language .
I would be grateful if you would send me more information of this work and you can get in touch with my on 671234567 .
I look forward to hearing from you early .
Yours faithfully
Hi Anne ,
I 'm so happy to hear from you and pleased that you 're coming .
I look forward to seeing you when you arrive here .
Personally , I think the best month to come to Italy is April as the weather is temperate .
In my opinion if you want to meet people of our age I suggest going to the most famous local or places of the city .
How about going out with me and my friends ?
We can see each other in the centre and then we visit the city all together .
April is a very nice month .
Although the weather can change more easily , so you should bring different kinds of clothes both heavy and light .
The perfect outfit can be a pair of trousers , a t - shirt and a jacket .
Thanks a lot for your invitation and if I was n't so busy , I would travel around with you .
Anyway , I 'll wait for a message to tell me when you are arriving .
Best wishes ,
Aurora
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am writing with reference to my stay in your hotel last week .
I wish I could express my dissatisfaction with the facilities .
I am afraid to say the room was dirty and untidy .
At night , the noise was annoiying , I was not able to rest properly .
Besides , the phone did not work properly , it was imposible the use of it to call the receptionist .
In addition the elvetor was out of order .
There were six of us from a school , and we all agree the stay was unpleasant .
In the end , to my surprise , the price was more expensive than I expected as it was announced in your web .
It seems a tax was the excuse , but in my opinion this is a deceit .
I regret to inform you that if you do not offer my apologies and a compensation for all the disturbance caused to me I would go to the main authority .
I look forward to receiving a prompt reply .
Yours faithfully ,
Angel
All about me
Hello ! My name is Emma and I 'm 13 years old .
Now I am going tell you some facts about myself and my life .
I was born here in Sweden , actually right here at Danderyds hospital , but I lived in the city back then .
When I was about three years old we moved here , to Danderyd .
I lived in a yellow house , not far away from where I live now ( probably just five minutes ) until a year ago when we moved to a much bigger house .
I live here with my wonderful family based on my mum Aylin , my dad Tom , my two really annoying brothers Hans and Oliwer , and my two cats Tiger and Smilla .
Hans is 10 years old and Oliwer is 7 years old .
In the middle of the summer we always go to Gotland and stay at a farm , in a little house .
I go by cycle to " Fribergaskolan " every day together with my friends Tekla , Julia and Bianca .
I really think it is a great school with very kind teachers and students .
I like to dance a lot .
On Monday and Thursday I dance at a dance - school here , close to " Mörby Centrum " , called C - style .
I dance a mixture of street dance and show dance .
I also like riding horses , that is one of the thing I often do when we are at Gotland , by the way .
Right now I 'm actually in a riding course every Sunday .
We are just three girl , and I think this kind of riding is so much more fun than riding at a stable with big groups and so on .
I really like Spain , we have been there like six times and the reason is that my dad has a project there and sometimes he has to go there for a week or less and we have the luck to be able to join him .
I really like to eat sushi and other Asian food , like noodles .
My favorite restaurant is a restaurant in Stockholm at Östermalm called : " New Peeking " it 's an Asian buffé and they make the best food .
My favorite subject in school is probably Swedish , English or biologi .
My favorite book is right now : " The fault in our stars " because its a really good subject and it is sad but great story .
My favorite movie is maybe " TED " or " Grown ups " because they are really fun movies with some sad moments .
On the holidays and after school I 'm often with my friends and family .
I have a lot of friends in my new class and I knew almost everyone of them in my old school ( called Kyrkskolan ) .
One of my other big hobbies is photographing .
I got one own camera , it 's a Canon .
The biggest accident in my life was probably when I was three years old .
It was midsummer and my mum was outside on the terrace .
I wanted to go out to her so I open the door on the wrong side by putting my long finger and ring finger in the little crevice .
Suddenly a powerful wind make the door blow up and squeeze my finger really hard .
I screamed and it started to bleed really much .
My fingers were almost cut so my dad wrapped my fingers in bandage and we drove to the doctor as fast as we could .
They had to sew my finger but in the end everything went fine .
And today I got normal fingers .
I like animals very much and I want to become a vet when I get older . I have got a lot of animals in my life .
Three words who describe me best : committed , animal lover , loyal friend
That was the most important fact about me .
Emma Öberg 7A3
I live in Camden .
In camden every block counts with three or four containers to recycle paper , plastic , glass and old clothes .
Also , every flat or house has a recycling bag to recycle paper and a plastic container to recycle organic waste .
The council recollects , once a week , door to door paper and organic waste .
There has been an extensive campaign to limit the amount of water used to water plants and to wash cars .
What is more , people are encouraged to collect rain water to use in these activities .
Public transport was made accessible by reducing the fares and making it free for students .
Nowadays there are a lot of information about healthy , in order to have good food habits , sleep the amounght of hours recommended by specialist doctors , etc .
For these reasons I consider that could be a good option doing any sport that you like or you may be interested in .
In my case I really like doing spinning , I use to do it only twice per week but now I do that every time I can .
I think that in particular , spinning is a hard sport activity because when you was approximately 1 hour over your bike you 'll probably feel taired .
During the process people works a lot their legs , mixing different positions and speeds , And the most important thing , the musis is always running .
If you want to lose weight this type of sport is perfect because it belong into the aerobic exercises to burn the calories that we get eating fast food whereas it is suitable to people that only just doing exercise to entertainment .
Furthermore from the first time that I was in the gym I have known nice and friendly sportsman who try to give me advice not only how improve my techniques but how avoid injury .
Although it is kind of hard for young people who finished school finally , to understand that it 's definitely not finish yet , education do n't stops from then on and it is one of the most important things to continue going to school .
On the the other hand , young people in Bosnia do n't really have the opportunity to choose , if they want to go or not .
They finish school at the age of 23 - 24 including a further study without a chance of work or anything else .
To this , I think , it is a way which goes in the wrong direction .
Try to motivate people for education , studying and school is a very hard thing if they all know all those Imaginations are not going to happen anyway , whereas people in Switzerland have to choose very early in which direction they want to go and what their possibilities look like .
Therefore , education should be reachable for everyone , in my opinion , as long as possible , but only if the goal and possibilities are clear .
Only if all of that is guaranteed the motivation will rise .
Now shopping became one of the best way to spend time with family or friends , but not everyone like it .
For the most of men shopping is so boring and exhausting , but for the women it can be the best way to make better their mood , because they are so happy when they buy many clothes on sale , cheaper than in regular price .
I think that the shopping is not enjoyable for everyone when in the shops are a crowd and very long queue .
Then you spend more time in the shop and you will be more tired .
In the big shopping centre your pocket can be stolen by pickpocket and you can lost a lot of money .
Personally I really like shopping , because I am interested in fashion and I like look good .
So for me shopping is very enjoyable and I always forget about my problems when I try on new clothes , which suit to me .
But I do not like wasting my time too , so I usually do shopping in Mondays , because after the weekend shops are always empty .
Nowadays the technology and the society have changed in different ways and most people have more free time than years before .
This could be good , allthough some people say we need n't all this time and we have to work more .
First of all could be said that the society is spending more time doing relaxing things such as going to the beach or meet friends , and some experts say that we have to spend more time working or studying because people is becoming lazier .
In contrast , the technology have been becoming more useful and it could do works that we had to do some years ago and having more free time could be better for us .
Another point is that we can meet more friends or visit our family if we have more free time and that is allways good .
In other words could be said that if we have more free time our lifes would become better because we can enjoy with friends and do thigs with our family .
Frome my point of view , having free time is perfect because we can do more things that we are fond of and our quality of life would icrease
Hi James ,
how things are going ?
I hope you 're fine !
You ca n't imagine how I 'm excited about tripping to the UK !
After all those letters we sent each other , now we can meet for real .
I 'm looking forward being there to spend some time with you .
I 've never been to London and what 's more I 'm scared of big cities , therefore I 'll literally stick to you wherever we 'll go !
I 've been searching for a lot of stuff we could visit once I got there , for example Piccadilly Circus .
At a glance it seems very original and particular , is n't it ?
I think it would be fascinating go sightseeing around there and I could find some souvenir for my family .
Oh and given you 're a huge soccer fan like I do , what about planning a match involving some friend of yours ?
It would be amazing !
If you manage to organize it beforehand I 'll have the time to prepare all soccer stuff ( boots etc . ) .
Shortly I 'll give you some other information .
Write back soon ,
Mario
My name is Sylwia .
I was born in Polonne , a small town in Ukraine .
My school is located there .
When I was 17 I moved to Kyiv .
I study filology .
A few years ago I worked as literal editor .
Now I am working as a jornalist at National Radio .
I hate my job .
You may ask why is that .
I 'll tell you .
First of all I get less than 100 dollars for my work .
My programs are for the old people in different villages .
My colleagues are brain - damaged .
I want to grow .
But instead I am writing abour stupid decorations , illnesses and other boring stuff .
Next year I 'll be a PHD .
I was going to be a scientist , but I 'm not sure anymore .
I want to have kids and family .
I 'm trying to choose the best time for all these .
Can I cope with all that by myself ?
I 'm not sure .
I feel awful .
Sometimes it 's hard to believe that everything will be OK .
My country was attacked by Russia .
God , save us from the evil .
Teach us how to love .
Friendship is one of the most valuable sentiments for people , especially for people who are in school days .
Making new friends and sharing interests with others are always exciting parts of social life .
When it comes to the best way for students to make friends , some support that participating in community activities or traveling are preferable , however , from where I am stand , joining a sports team is the undoubtedly the best choice .
First of all , for the energetic students , doing sports is their favorite .
Therefore , joining a sports team from where they can share same interests and relax is the easiest way to know each other .
Training in the same sports team , the students can not only release them from whole day 's pressure , but also can build up good relationships with others through the communication and exercise .
For example , the champions of Olympic Games , China 's famous synchronized diving athletes , GuoJingjing and Wu Minxia , the two girls enjoy a really good friendship .
They became to know each other because they both joined the same sports team , and then after exercised and played together ; they finally become two enviable friends .
Additionally , cooperation and coherency are always the main essence of a sports team .
Here , students learn how to work together , how to fight for the same goal through tacit teamwork , how to contribute to the whole team instead of just thinking of self , and even how to negotiate or discuss with others , as well as how to be patient and rational .
Although there may be some argument or disagreement among students , I always think that everything is going to be okay because the sports team will be coherent .
Finally , joining a sport team will provide a long period of time for students to get along with each other .
However , if students participate in community activities , for example , doing volunteer job in the town 's library , they would not have sufficient time to communicate with each other since most of their time is full of working .
Meanwhile , students can play with each other during traveling , but only several days are deficient and most people will not keep in touch with others after the trip .
Sorry that I haven't been in touch for a while , but I 've been really busy lately .
How are you ? have you something new to tell me ?
Is everything ok with your family ?
Well , I have a good news for you ! I met a wonderful girl last weeck when I went to the cinema .
I was in the queue when I saw her wearing a stylish tight black dress .
She is perfect , with her long curly dark hair , and her pale skin .
She has a wonderful body , but in her face you can see the perfection .
Her slanted eyes and her shiny lips are gorgeous .
I want to introduce her assap !
See you soon .
Take care ,

" The Good Samaritan "
My country 's media this year celebrated a doctor who works in Afghanistan .
His name 's Roberto Cairo .
He set up a hospital in Kabul to take care of the mine 's victims .
He was decorated by the Italian President last June .
In my opinion he 's a hero of our times .
He left his job in a safe and comfortable Italian hospital to move in a country that lives a civil war .
He 's very brave to work in one of the most dangerous places of the Earth .
His charity 's saved many lives .
Every day he works hard to give support to the people injured by the mines .
In my opinion we need to thank people like him .
We never forget what he 's done , we must n't forget what he 's done .
Dear Mr. Leader ,
I am writing to you , because I 've heard that you 're planning a trip to our city - Katowice .
We have so many interesting places to visit , but if I must limit to only one I chose the centre of the city .
It is renovating , but you can see many beautiful buildings .
First of all , I have to show you our theatre and if you want to , we can go on an art .
In this theatre perform fantastic actors and I would like you to see their best play which is " Jackyl and Hide " .
Besides btilliant actors they have incredible decor and it 's perfectly situated , that is very near to the bus stop .
I hope you 'll enjoy our city centre , there you can entertain and learn something about our city .
It is really interesting place and I think you 'll appreciate this .
In case of any questions , please , write me an e - mail I answer them with pleasure .
Yours faithfully ,
Dominika .
I agree with this statement that shopping is not always enjoyable .
Some people like to do shopping every day .
Some do not like but it is a personal business .
Some people go shopping to feel better for themselves .
If they have bad day or if they have a good day .
Tend to be people who are dependent on purchases .
I personally love to do shopping and spend my money for new clothes .

Last week , my friends and I were selected from the class to go on a fascinating trip to a contemporary and magnificent museum .
At this mind - blowing place , we looked and gazed at the phenomenally awe - inspiring and unbelievable fossils of ancient dinosaur bones up to 100 meters high !
We also made brilliant mini statues of a type of dinosaur , I did the T - Rex and my mate assembled a Raptor .
I luxuriate the manufacture of the spellbinding models and the gift we get to pick in the dinosaur shop .
I enjoyed this unforgettable experience to the meseum , and hope you can take your time out to go one day !
Kind Regards ,
Jon

When i grow up I want to work with music in some kind , but if i do n't work with that then I want to work with animals !
I think the most beautiful building that I have visited is the " Monumento a La Bandera " .
It 's placed in Rosario , Argentina .
It was built on June 20 , 1957 by the architect and engineer Angel Guido to celebrate the Flag Day .
In the same place where Manuel Belgrano first raised the Argentina flag on February 27 , 1812 .
It has a tower of 70 meters with a viewpoint on the top , and it is famous for its big flag and the crypt in tribute to Manuel Belgrano .
Inside the " Monumento a La Bandera " you can see historical objects about the history of Argentina , in the underground it 's the hall of honor of American Flags .
If you want to enter to the hall of honor or enter to the monument it 's free but if you want to go up to the viewpoint , unless you are younger 5 , you must pay an entrance fee of 10 $ argentines .
The building is open from 9:00 to 19:00 every day .
Hate them or love them , villains are the funniest part in every story board .
Since I was a child , my favourite characters are being the cruellest one .
Why ?
Obviously because in every story , book or movie , despite heroes are weaker than bad characters , they always win !
What a boring situation !
For example , in Terminator 's movies villain was always stronger and more equipped than hero , but at the end of the movie the righteous wins the battle .
Finally , latest movies are based on cruel , bad , dirty and strong character ! Enjoy them !
In recent years , social media sites have developed and interpenetrated our society as the essentials rapidly .
There are enormous numbers of users all over the world , and social media sites such as Twitter , Facebook and YouTube are utilized for acquiring some information , contributing ideas , sharing photographs and communicating between individuals , individuals and organization or between organizations .
While social media sites change our society more convenient and more comfortable as compared with the past , they simultaneously accompany some issues .
There are two advantages and a disadvantage of the current social consequences , and I mention conceivable effects of social media site in the future .
Bulgarian parents can choose when their children start school- at 6 or 7 years old .
Before they start school they have to finish preschool .
Usually children go to kindergarten up to 5 years old , and after that they start preschool .
In this case they start school at 6 years .
Some children start school at 7 years old , it depends on when they are born - at the beginning or near the end of the year .
The Bulgarian school year starts in the middle of September .
So if the child is born in the first few months of the year , parents can choose when their child will start school at 6 years and few months or 7 years and few months .
Most Bulgarian parents are not agree their children to start school at 6 years old .
However , Bulgarian government was thinking change the law so all children have to start at 6 years old .
I think I ca n't compare education of children in school or tertiary education between Bulgarian and Australia , because I still do n't have children and I am not studding in university in Australia .
Let me introduce you to my hometown , Kortrijk .
Kortrijk is a small town , located in the northern part of Belgium .
It is also the Dutch speaking part of Belgium .
Kortrijk is nearby the French border about 15 minutes by car .
The town has 100.000 inhabitants .
It was built in the 11th century and is well known for its shopping area .
Ou
After a day of shopping , you can go at one of the many restaurants Kortrijk has .
You can choose between several types of food such as Japanese , Italian , French and many other food .
Of course you can eat the typically Belgian dish mussels with French fries .
In summer Kortrijk organises little concerts .
The concerts attract many people from all over Belgium .

The last few years a lot of building has been done in the area .
New bridges have enriched the town .

Dear Sir or Madam ,
last week , I was on holiday with my family in your " New Holiday Village " .
Unfortunately , our holiday did not live up to the claims made by you .
We had a number of problems ; the first one is concerning the number of beds : You offered space to sleep for six persons so we excepted six bed , but we only had five .
So , two of us had to share one bed , which is hardly acceptable
The other problems is about the offered excursions : You promised a number of attractions , but two ( the walk up to the mountain as well as the visit of a historic castle ) were not available .
Unfortunately , we also had problems with nutrition : In your brochure it was told that we will have a number of restaurants around , but in fact there was only one which was , in addition to that , really expensive .
This is in our honest opinion not acceptable , because in the brochure you talked about more than one restaurant .
To sum it up : We were not very pleased with our holiday as we could not enjoy some of the things you promised to us in the brochure .
We are the opinion that you should not offer things which are in fact not available .
Yours sincerely ,
Anna Olsen and family .
How people 's lives will change in the future ?
It requires a rich imagination to try to put a view of the future , first of all the means of transport will change , depend mainly on the solar energy or the nuclear energy , a flying public transport bus will be a fast ride to work , you will need to supply your car with spinache after they invent a spinache - using car .
Also the food will change in the future , capsules of your favourite foods will be available at the future in the mobile supermarkets , these capsules turn into your lunch as soon as you put a small amount of water on it .
In the future water will be very expensive to the extent that you will have to work three hours of overtime everyday to be able to pay for half a liter of clean water , but the one thing that will never change in the future is the smile on your mother 's face when you surprise her by cleaning your bedroom without using the robot that belongs to your older brother .
I think today 's television is still a good value , because there is more choice than ever before .
You can see whatever you want , whenever you want!There 's always something to watch for everybody .
Of course I think that we should n't watch too much television .
I think that 's the only negatieve point from today 's television , because maybe there 's too much choice !
Some people just watch tv the whole day long , and stay in their houses .
They just ca n't stop watching television , because there 's just so much what they like to watch .
I think that we should promise ourselves that we just watch maximal 1 hour TV every day .
In that way , we can enjoy all that new technology from today , and all the enjoyable tv - programms !
This photo shows me and my best friend .
It was taken on the embankment of Khabarovsk .
On the background you can see the river Amur .
On the left you can see people on an observation area .
They 're enjoying the view .
I was very excited because it was my first visit to Khabarovsk in the summer .
The city looks beautiful in this time .
By the way , in that day Everybodys were celebrating the Day of the City .
Afterwards we went for a walk .
We felt happy because we have not seen for a long time .
We used to engage in dancing and singing .
When we were schoolgerls we used to spend all our free time together .
We are living in different places now .
Luckily , we are in touch .
It 's not difficult today !
Lots of modern messenger like WhatsApp , Skipy , Vier make it possible for us to talk , chart as much , as we want .

This year is the last one before going to university .
After so much time at school some people think they need a break .
On one hand , it is true that leaving school means passing from the basis to your future profession .
After sixteen years of continues work , it is the perfect moment to take a rest and enjoy your life by travelling .
To know about other cultures and get new knowledge completly different from school .
However it could be a great time to work and earn some money for paying university or simply for saving it .
On the other hand , maybe if we have a break until university the routine of working and studing every day could break .
So when univerity starts , people will become busy , the routine will not be the same , and as a consecuences the marks will be lower .
to conclude , I think after school we need apply for university in order to continue working in what we like .
The year off should be taken after university studies
As the number of traffic accident has increased dramatically over the year , finding the best solutions has putted the government under pressure to whether implementing stricter penalties or using alternative regulations .
Personally , road safety can not be ensured with either former or later methods .
Instead , it should be a combination of various actions .
As a matter of fact , severe punishments can partly decrease the rate of offences .
Nobody wants to pay an expensive fine or spend time in prison , so fear of punishment might be effective and prevent people to make the offence a second time .
Moreover , one 's penalty also can be considered as a mirror that people can look at and avoid doing the same things .
The main offences are driving over the speed limits , drunk driving , driving without licences .
Its penalties , depends on the severity , could include fines , licence suspension , community services or imprisonment .
Consequently , those punishments make the drivers have to concentrate on driving only , therefore , minimize the amount of accidents .
By the same token , a sole method could not solve the traffic problems as driving offences are not the only reason that cause traffic accidents .
Authorities should enact more safety policy on road and ensure by improving the quality of traffic facilities .
In many developing countries , government rarely attach special important to both the quality and quantity of the traffic system , especially in rural areas .
People easily get accidents when driving in narrowed or severely damaged streets .
Furthermore , vehicle collisions are rising greatly due to number of unclear road signs .
Traffic education is also an compulsory measure , especially to young generations as they cover majority of offences .
People should be educated carefully about all the safety regulations and laws when they get driving licence , the more they know the rules , the less risks are taken on road .
In general , betterment of reducing traffic accidents is important .
Therefore , it should be considered carefully on how to combine both severe penalties and many other regulations .
Public transportation once used to be a convenient and inexpensive way to transport oneself in the city .
However , the increasing number of car ownership has been taken place of public transportation , providing more convenience to get around places to places .
Traveling by cars gives flexibility in our schedule .
We do not have to concern to catch a bus or train at certain time .
We can get on a car whenever we want to go to places and drive .
Such convenience of cars can enables us to use our time efficiently .
However , cars can not take place of public transportations just for that convenience .
Maintaining cars is cost associative .
Driving a car requires to fuel gas , and gas prices are becoming more and more expensive .
In addition , cars require regular maintenance such as oil change and checking tire pressures .
Mechanical problems can often be a costly problems .
Unlike public transportation , one has to be responsible for his or her tool of transportation , and it could be expensive sometimes .
On the other hand , the public transportation is inexpensive .
Not to mention not everyone can afford keeping a car with their budget .
In other perspective , cars require to drive .
Driving is not everyone can do .
For example , people who have disabilities and certain diseases are not able to drive .
Children under certain age are not permitted to drive .
For those people , public transportation can be an optimal choice of transportation .
In conclusion , cars are convenient , however , it is not for everyone use .
Therefore , the public transportation has its own means of existence , and there is a future for public transportation .
Dear friends !
Our congregation has carried educational family camps with the support of NNNs Integration programme for 8 years .
We have a hugeexperience in organising seminars and camps for families with disabled children .
For many of children participating in this camp is the only opportunity to spend time with the coevals and to feel fully - fledged members of the society .
Words fail to express emotions that all participants experience .
Health improvements of some children can be considered a miracle .
All children get a lot of positive emotions spending time together and learning how to be tolerant .
Reduction in financial support from foreign charity foundations leads to make our camp not possible to happen this year .
Our budget is fixed for only 75 people , it is almost twice a number of participants last year .
We do n't know and we do n't want to know how to refuse a participation in the camp to children in this situation !
We want all our children to go to this camp , so we set up a donation project .
The greater amount of money has already been collected thanks to the trustee board of " NNN " community , but we still need additional $ 13000 .
We are asking you not to stay indifferent to disabled children and to provide feasible help .
( Essay )
The idea that newspapers will diminish by time due to people 's perspective toward surfing the internet for the worldwide news does not necessarily mean that it can be taken for granted .
One of the most controversial issues nowadays is that a large sector of the society deals with newspapers as a daily routine .
They ca n't withstand one day without skimming through their pages with a cup of tea in the morning .
To the best of my knowledge , it is a way of behaving more than a way coping with the latest technologies .
To begin , the reason for decreasing the popularity of news papers is that most people , recently , rely on being online most of the time to follow the latest news all around the world .
The second main reason is that online news is often free of charge .
Thus , people read news at any time and for free .
On the other hand , newspapers are presented in a definite place , with limited time in addition they are daily payable .
While some may claim that credibility is the main reliable aspect of publishing .
It is obvious that the daily newspapers having a respectful reputation are the ones which could be accepted by thousands of people .
In this respect , newspapers seem to be more credible than numerous websites that make up fake stories much more than publishing real news .
Furthermore , reading habits have their own taste , specifically for those elderly people .
They enjoy turning the pages and reading the headlines using their eyeglasses .
That marvelous tasteful generation ca n't be buried alive as they have their own experiences and influences upon the modern society .
In light of the forgoing discussion , it appears to be true that the internet is an incredible aspect toward globalisation even in daily news worldwide .
However , the newspapers still have their lead in that perspective .
It can be suggested that combination of both arenas will positively influence the ways of delivering news .
Last week one friend of mine told me about a new cafe that had just opened near my house and that she thought it was a magic place .
At first , I did n't belive that this place would be as amazing that she said .
However , I accepted her plan and I met her at " Wonderland Café " .
I have to be honest and recommend all of you this magic place .
It has almost everything that you need in a cafe , comfortable chairs and sofas , beatiful features and a really good - taste coffee that they serve in most of twenty different ways and with all toppings you can think in .
Althoug the most important thing is that there were not only friendy staff but they look like if they were having tea in Wonderland , with Alice and the White Rabbit .
I strongly recommend this café if you want to enjoy an excellent coffee with a careful decoration and brilliant performances in which you can participate while having a drink .
You will love it ! !
I 'm 50 years old and I 'm living in a little city named Monza .
At my age is very important to keep fit so I ride twice a week .
This sport is not so hard , give me the opportunity to do an activity that is not too expensive and could be done outdoors and not in a closed sportshall .
When I came back from my job , in the afternoon , I wear something comfortable , take my bike and go away over the street alone with my thoughts and no one could disturb me .
Whenever I go out with my bike I stay on the way for two hours and I enjoy so much this time for myself that I 'll remain outside for ever .
For everyone who would like to start this sport is important to remember that you are alone with yourself and must have the power to improve the time you 'll stay out and never give up .

I think this thriller will get your nerves out of you , the movie reveals many things as it continues it 's actually so good and for those that are scared about thrillers , this movie is more like suspense and I really think you can enjoy it .
When facing a decision on whether to shop in a shopping center or in small stores , many people will choose the shopping center because you can buy all types of products at once .
Others , including myself , believe that shop in small stores is the premium choice .
In the following essay , I will outline two reasons to support my view .
First , small stores provide products with more unique feature and different selection .
That is to say , most small stores may have their own logos on mugs or even T - shirts and it is more likely to find handmade products in it .
For instance , my friends once bought a nice scruff with cute animal figure in a small store and I really like it after she showed me .
Therefore , the next day she brought me back to the store , we found out that they did not have the same scruff because it is the only one .
Although I was disappointed that I could not have the same scruff but this is the fun part that shop in small stores , you can always find something unique .
Second , it is true that shop in a shopping center is fast and convenient because one can buy all types of things together .
However , most shopping center provide limited selections and sometimes the price is expensive .
In conclusion , I prefer to shop in a small stores because it is more likely to find the one and the only product while it also provides a sense of treasure hunting .
The changes on television are evident , it could be because the society are changing too .
On television we can see what people consume .
If tv 's programmes are a lot of rubbiss , is because some people prefer those .
So , we have to take care of it .
Maybe , there are a lot of repeats of old programmes , but some of them are still watched for a long number of people .
And sometimes , programmes are so aggressive and gives people bad messages .
On the other hand , there is some channels , which show documentaries and programmes about specific subjects like science , math or history .
And there are musical channels too .
I think there are good tv 's programmes , but people do n't give them the value that they should have .
There are a lot of old programmes , but it is n't a problem .
The television has still something important to show .
I am writing to congratulate on the excellent Dumplings Festival which I attended in Cracovie last November .
I spend a great time with my friends , but I have a few comments concering the organisation .
I was far from impressed by all dumplings which housewives prepared .
In my opinion dumplings with spinach tasted great .
I am impressed a cabaret who performed during the festival .
Them jokes were very funny .
However , there are a couple of small sugestions .
First of all , the vanue itself was very crowded and parking almost impossible to find .
It could be a good idea to find a large location .
I saw a parents with children but kids did not have many attractions .
I would like to suggest fire special animators wgo will entertain kids .
In addiction tickets were too expensive .
you should think about reducing proces or prepare special discount for xample for students .
Once again please accept my compliments on a job well done I hope you find my suggestions helpful and I look forward toa n even more successful event next year .
Yours faitfully
These days , the use of technology is increasing , especially robots .
According to Russell and Norwing robots are especial machines that have intelligence to executed activities on their own or by command ( as cited in Chijindu & Inyiama , 2012 ) .
They represent an innovation that has changed the world in distinct ways and have implanted in different areas of society ; for example in security , health , army forces , education , industries and agriculture .
Consequently , positive and negative social impacts can be observed by the population .
More accurate surgeries , emotional bond and increase of communication are examples of positive consequences .
Negative impacts such as the human dependence on robots for doing basic activities and pollution of environment can be cited .
This essay will describe the positives and negatives social consequences of the robots , and possible implications in the future .
Each day , the environment suffers different problems caused by the global warming and human are the unique guilty of this issue .
We need to analyze and investigate the main problems to find solutions which may get better our world .
First of all , transport is the most relevant carbon dioxide 's emitter .
As we know , in all cities a lot of cars are used every day unnecessarily .
Probably , if we used up public transport like bus instead of private , we would reduce the greenhouse effect because of the CO2 produced .
Secondly , the huge amount of litter floating in the rivers and sea 's water destroys the ecosystem and has a high visual impact .
Sometimes , cities get rid of rubbish throwing it to the water .
An easy answer could be building more landfills .
Last , I 'll propose a solution of a common and near problem .
Reusing things that we do n't utilize ( like clothes , furniture … ) and give them a ' second life ' .
I think we must be down to earth and creative to cut down our daily trash 's production .
To sum up , it 's necessary to solve the environmental problems to keep safe our planet , so we had better start resolving closer issues .
If we avoid them , the earth will get worse .
Dear Jo ,
I 'm happy that you wrote me to ask some advice .
Well , to travel there in Brazil , you have to choose some places to go , because here we have a lot of beautiful places to visit and have fun .
To help you , I need to know what do you prefer to do .
If you want to go to the beach , I 'll tell you to visit the Northeast 's beaches because there are the most beautiful beaches in the entire world .
You have to pass some days in Fernando de Noronha .
For these places , the best season is the Summer .
One other place to visit in Summer is the pantanal .
There you will see one of the most beautiful biome that you have seen .
In pantanal the weather ir hot and wet , and we can drive into the river deeper in the wood and see the wild animals like the alligators .
If you want to come here in the Winter , you have to know the South .

Chinese , Spanish and Portuguese no one of those languagues are so popular as English is .
Over 1 billion people around the world speak English as a second language because of that it is considered the universal language .
Nowadays , it is an obligation to get a better job .
I will discuss the importance of English as a second language in Brazil .
Even though , study a language become easier because of the internet , fluency is harder to get when you study by yourself .
Brazillians need learn English because it opens doors in business and in higher education .
In Brazil , regular schools teach for students the basic aspects of the language and do not let them emerge in the language .
It can explain a little bit of Brazil 's lack of English speakers .
Learn English as a foregein language will make a huge impact in brazillians ' professional life to get a better position .
To conclude , Brazil has deficiency of English speakers .
The brazillian educational system should be aware to develop more students ' language skills .
Learn English as a second language will help brazillians to get a better job and have more opportunities in their careers .
It is a rich , graceful and delightful language to learn .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .
To the national championships in swimming , she was preparing since last summer .
Taking part in it and gaining the best place was her biggest dream .
Especially since the previous national competitions when she suffered a shoulder injury and could not start .
After all , this is a hard work from an early age and on the list of players does not enter by accident .
But the daily duties , which she had as a teenager , and the murderous workouts till midnight , built in her the strong will to fait .
She knew that besides her , the race will be attended by the best girls from all over the country .
Dressed in a swimsuit , she was waiting in front of a swimming pool for the next judges command .
Only a few seconds separated her from the jump to the water .
The judge ordered to take place at the sites .
Anna looked again toward the audience , where her the best fans in the world were sitting - her parents , friends , coach and friends .
They all were keeping their fingers crossed .
She swam so fast , like a former fish , not a human being .
In the water she feels like at home .
Only after a while , after a few quick and short breaths occurred to her that she fulfilled her biggest dream .
Anna won first prize , regained confidence .
It was one of the happiest day of her life .
I would n't like to be a teacher since I do n't like children a lot .
I am not as patient as a teacher has to be with all his students although only some of them are naughty .
Many of my friends are teachers , they like their job despite the fact that they often have to deal with lively children or lazy students and heavy parents .
These people sometimes think of their sons or daughters as innocent angels who spend a lot of their time with inexperienced teachers with no qualifications .
Teaching could be a stimulating working environment for students and teachers if it involved a rewarding career and the improvement of teaching skills .
In this case , teaching would n't be monotonous and with no opportunities or prospects .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am writing to ask you if your school could organize an individual course in English for me .
I study English for two reasons .
First , it is necessary for my job ; second it is my hobby .
I have been studying English for ten years . I make sense of the reading , but I am not good at listening and writing .
My pronunciation is not always correct , as a result I have some problems with listening . I know English economic terminology very well but my everyday English is rather poor .
However , my grammar is not that bad .
I score 56% in my last test .
I would like to sign up for a summer course for three months .
I enjoy visiting museums , travelling in my free time .
I prefer learning on a one - to - one basis , because it is more comfortable for me .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Sincerely ,
Evgenia Ilyina .

It is said that no future for public transportation . I think it when I was young , but it is changed while I am getting older .
But it is changed recently , I fell down and hurt my knee , so that I can not drive by myself .
Now I need it again .
There are a lot of benefits by developing public transportation .
First , it is more convenient .
Most developed countries developed the public transportation system to low the impact of growing population .
Then , it is cost effective .
Shared cost let the huge expense on developing and building the public system possible .
Finally , it is environmentally .
Public transportation is proved less energy consumption .
I still think the public transportation system will be growing on in such a crowded era .
How long haven't you use public transportation ? do you agree that there is no future for public transport ?
I personally think so , the reasons are as below :
First , As we all know , Cars play a very important role in our life , the more and more cars come into our family .
Also travelling , of course , that 's a big part of the function of the car !
The very well developed highways , roads , city streets provide a good foundation for the cars , look at the North America , the highways were developed anywhere , it 's really your own lose if you do n't drive a car , drive on them(highways )
Second , Human start to learn driving at the age of 16 , and they can master the driving skills very quickly ( within a month or two ) , soon they can drive to wherever they want to go , and we also see people at the age of 80 still drive to their destinations as they got used to it .
so who care to bother taking the public transportation anymore ?
Third , The public transportation sucks , when you think about it , you can picture the crowded subways , dirty buses , and the difficulty / hussults between the public transportation transfer in your mind .
The wasted time also should weight in , whether it is waiting for the trains , or waiting for the delayed buses , not to mention the longer time it takes compared to travelling in a car .
And driving your own car can be very convenient too , it can right come to your own garage .
All in all , Public transport is not as fast as a car can be ; it 's not as convenient as a car can provide , so it 's future is in doubt .
I agree with this statement that being safe is better than feeling sorry .
There are the three following reasons .
Firstly , no one like to be sad .
Life is full of good things why do n't we look to the full side of the cup instead of looking at the empty one ?
Being sad and sorry will destroy your life , because you will not be able to work , eat and live in a good way .
All of this will affect your life badly , maybe you will lose your job or your health will not be good anymore .
Secondly , Eveybody seeks safetiy in their lives .
Look around you , crimes and death are srounding us , all this people are dreaming to live a peaceful life without all the aspects of killing and sadness .
People are fighting as they can to only reach a calm life where everyone of them can be safe .
Thirdly , I lived two years without feeling safe and comfortable .
The war in my country make me feel no longer safe .
For that reason I beleive that being safe is absloutly better than sorry . I will always remember my dad telling me to calm down , saying that the life will go on and oneday all of us will be satsfied with this life .
In conclusin , I think that all of us should see through rose -tinted glasses and be happy , because you live a calm life without anything makes you sorry .
Be someone famous for a day
If I could change places for 24 hours with a famous person , I would like to be Paula Echevarria
I start telling something about Paula Echevarria , she is a very pretty and famous actress , she also writes in a fashion blong , she is 34 years old and she is married with David Bustamente who is a popular and hadmesome singer in Spain , they have a daughTer , her name is Daniela and they are like a perfect family .
I have chosen Paula because she is popular , famous , rich and she has the perfect husband but above all I choose her because she is friendly , intelligent and she is always smiling .
Therefore she has everything good aobut being a celebrity but the most important is that she is a great person .
Let me conclude by saying that I would like to be Paula for one day because Not only is she a good professional but also a wonderful role model to be followed by everyone .
I would like to talk about my hobby of breeding birds , this hobby is very pleasant to me and also for many people , especially when you have different kind of singing birds like canary or finches … .
This hobby give me pleasure and good sense of nature , especially when I wake up with the sound of the singing birds in my house .
At present , I have three kinds of birds , one of them is yellow canary , the second one is finch , and the third one is combination of two kinds of birds , Each bird has his own special voice .
I 've started this hobby since 2007 , and since then I have tried to have many different kinds of the singing birds , I spent one day in the week to take care of them , feeding them , cleaning the cages , change the water .
I would like to recommend this hobby to many people , because it give us the sense of nature , and fills the house with the joy and happiness .
By increasing the veriety of cars with new technolgy , people 's demand hasnt ' stop .
But are these new comers will be placed by public transport ?
As technology enhanced the life system in any way possible , people become more dependent and ca n't avoid it beacuse of many different attractions that these cars have .
Another reason for using their own car is that easy access in a second .
Furthure more , there are advantages travelling by a car , like seeing the scenery and also the costs is less in compare to plane .
But it 's not possible that every one have and use their own car .
In this case there will be a huge chaos .
Trafic jam will cost a lot , such as pollution which certainly cause more health problems and will make expense not only for us but for the others as well .
The solution is public transport again , which enhance the pace of life and make easy accsess by subways and special roads .
On the other hand , by increasing the population we should revise the regulation with the fast pace of technology .
To sum up , as thought the cars are too covenient to some extend , but the cost will reduce the benefit .
So for sure we will use public transport but maybe with some changes .

Speaking English is becoming essential for students and workers .
For this reason , school of English are opening in all the big cities as well in most towns .
Studying English in your country let you continue working or studying without change your habits .
Anyway , it must be taken into account that English courses are often very expensive , and you have to study in a constant way to improve class by class .
In fact , usually there is just one class per week , and it is not enough without studying by itself during the week .
Studying English abroad is the better alternative , but it have advantages and disadvantages .
On one hand , living abroad will be probably non cheap , so it could be needed to find a job , but it would be at the same time an advantage : working with English people would help you improve quickly your speaking and listening .
On the other hand , living abroad you 'll need to speak English all the time and you 'll have the opportunity to learn English in a short time , and in a not boring way .
So probably , if you have the opportunity to stay abroad several months , you should do it , to learn English and live a different experience .

I am going to write about a short story that I have read from the book : And all for love .
title : The kimono .
Written By Herbert Ernes Bates .
There are two main characters .
The plot is about a man , Arthur , twenty - five yeras old , engaged to a nice girl .
Arthur went to London to an appointment for a job interview .
The company requested him to go back three days later , so he was looking for a hotel that someone had recomemded him .
He got lost and asked about the hotel in a cafe owned by Blanche , a beautiful girl .
He was delighted with her and fell in love immediately .
This changed his life forever .
He Forgot his engagement and went to live with Blanche .
But all was not as wonderful as the expected .
twenty - five years later he regrets his decision and wonders what would have happened if he had not met Blanche .
I chose this story because even though this novel was written in the early twentieth century , the underlying theme , is still current today .
And also I would like to highlight that reflects the importance of every decision we make and how it can change our future .
" Atacama 33 "
" Atacama 33 " is a recent American movie that tells the real story of a group of miners that keep trapped in a mine 700 metres underground in Chile for two months .
This group had a leader called Mario Casas starring Antonio Banderas .
The film is well - developed and shows the audience every little issue and difficulty that miners had to go through .
However the first 17 days in the movie could turn a bit tedious because the director focused in every single feeling of the trapped men and their families .
After that lapse the rescuers found the place where the miners were hiding and the moment for rescue them started .
The characters were perfect as soon as they were people from Chile and Bolivia that were involve with the real accident .
Antonio Banderas made an excellent work acting as a desperate leader committed with the local people .
Despite some details , I think you ca n't miss this film if you want to know the truth of the recent miracle called " the Chilean miners " .
It is universaly known that shopping is not always enjoyable .
However , other people think in the opposite direction .
I agree that shopping is not always enjoyable .
Everyone know that shopping is a good way to spend time and get positive emotions or just relax .
Even though shopping can make bad affect on our health especially we can feel tired or exhausted in the end of hard day .
At the same time there are one more opinion that shopping is always enjoyable .
People declare that shopping can make our mood better what in consequence will make as fun .
As for me I do n't agree with these people .
Quite often in the shopping centre is not enough air and as the result you can get a headache or just feel bored .
In conclusion I would like to say that there are different views about shopping and it 's not surprise because we are all different .
Do we need the internet to enjoy life to the full ?
Internet has been developed a lot for the last years , and we can use easily for doing any tasks .
But it is a good invention for the world ?
To answer these questions we have to analyze giving some positive and negative arguments .
On the positive side , the use of internet helps us to find easily and quickly a lot of information that talk about all the topics .
What is more , we can only have to press one computer key to find what we are searching .
For this reason the most people have Internet at home .
On the negative side , the use of Internet can be a waste of time in our lives ; this happens because although search is faster , we can distract looking at other things on account of the attractive of the Internet .
Following the above argument , this is the danger of spend hours and hours surfing the web and not being in real world enjoying the live .
To sum up , the Internet is a good and efficient instrument if we know the correct use of it .
If not , it could be a waste of time that can produce the opposite meaning of enjoying the life .
Nowadays it is very frequent to meet new person coming from abroad who speak different languages and speak about their home countries .
This makes us curios to learn more about foreign countries and their cultures .
But to learn new cultures we must know their languages , especially if we want to travel .
Due to globalization there are more and more multinational companies that require employees who can speak at least fluent English but if a candidate knows more languages he can have more career chances and achieve top level positions .
In my opinion it is very important to speak several languages not only for above reasons but also to train brain , to have the opportunity to find a job abroad and , why not ?
, To have more fun with friends whom we now in our summer holidays abroad .
Unfortunately it is very difficult to learn foreign languages when we are adult so it is extremely important to teach and to study them since kindergarten age .
The doorbell rang insistetly , It was Saturday , in the earlier morning and I still was in bed .
The last low sound of the doorbell finished to wake me up."I am not dreaming " I thought , ¿ Who is ringing at this time?Then I jumped out of the bed and went down fast the upstairs .
I still was in pyjama , so I did n't open the door fast .
First I asked " ¿ Who is ringing so early?¿What 's happen?Suddenly , a family voice shouted me throughout the door .
You do n't think opening the door at your little brother¡Oh brother!I shouted and I ran to open de door .
What are you doing here ?
and He held me strongely .
What amazing surprise!I was very emocional and was about to cry .
But You were in Ireland , What are you doing here?I wo n't expect you .
I would want to do a surprise sister!I miss you .
I am so far from home .
It is sometimes very hard for me .
Oh I miss you too and I was looking forward to you .
I'm very excited because of you are here .
We are finally together .
It 's for three months since I was in Ireland visiting you .
I hope you are a lot of time now with me .
Yes .
I 'm going to stay one week .
I'm on holiday school .
Dear Jane ,
Thanks for your letter , it was so nice to hear from you !
How are you ?
I believe it is amazing the project that you are doing .
In answer to your question about the use of internet beyoung people of our age , I think it is very helpful to get information easier and quiker .
Although , it plays a freat role in removing the borders on nations , in a matter of seconds we can now communicate with people around the world , whether for important business matters or just talking to a friend .
Nowadays , the Internet is very useful , it has many ways of helping people such us with their homework , using Google , or entertainment websites like Youtube , emails websits such as Hotmail , and the number one social network site , Facebook .
Evidently , we can not imagine how much time we spend online , because we are the whold day connecting , in our houses , moviel phones and computers at work .
If there is anything else you want to know , drop me a line anytime .
Love ,

My favourite way to travel is by train because I love watching scenery through the windows .
I think it is a bohemian trip too because the train use to be one of the most appreciated means of transport in the literacy .
When you take a train , you can read and feel like Phileas Fogg in " Around the world in 80 days " .
I feel better when I travel over ground because I have fear of heights .
Although experts say the plane is the safest means of transport , I continue thinking It is very dangerous .
Probably , I 'm afraid of planes because the media use to show plane accidents more often .
The boat is a very beautiful way to travel , but I 'm sure when I travel by boat in the future , I 'll feel anxiety because I 'll be surrounded by water .
In conclusion , my main problem is the concern about how safe is the means of transport that I take , so , the train let me to be more relaxed than other ways to travel .
Volleyball is a complete sport where you can exercise all your muscles .
It 's a sport where two teams play on a court , which is separated for a central net .
The players have got a ball which has to cross at the other side .
Each team has got a limited number of taps to return the ball .
The ball , usually is hit with hands and arms , but also with any part of body .
A feature of the volleyball is that the players have to rotate their positions while they are getting points .
In fact , I enjoy playing volleyball because it is a fun sport which you can practise with a lot of people , eleven people concretely .
I suggest at the new players of volleyball that they have to start step to step .
It 's a sport that looks like easy , but you can injure easily .
Put comfortable clothes and suitable shoes .
Young people may confront some health issues , making bad choices , like for drugs and alcohol and also a negative body image , including crash dieting , eating disorders and obesity .
Nowadays they have to work through a lot of issues while they are in their adolescence , they begin to have lack of self - esteem , depression , social pressure , and all this can cause a lot of problems .
I 'm going to write about the obesity , a lot of people do n't eat correctly , they consume a lot of junk food and this cause effects in their health .
They have to realice that if they continue eating that way and not doing any exercise they are more likely to have differents diseases .
Maybe a lot of people that are fat do n't have the time to do exercise , or they have other reasons , but that is not an excuse , they have to have the habit of eat healthy food .
Another problem is like the junk food is really cheap , even cheaper that the healthy food , and people prefer to buy something cheaper and that 's a big problem .
They need to create a new lifestyle habit to reduce the obesity and have a better body image , they should have a healthy eating , and physical activity .
All this to be in your perfect healthy body .
I went to a workshop about the light controlled synthesizer .
To get to the place they were holding the workshop in you had to come to the Chester Beatty library and then the guides arrived and led you to it .
On the way there everyone who participated in the workshop stopped to buy some snacks .
We were told to choose biscuits and the guides paid for us .
When we reached the workshop the kids and I were told to put on protective glasses and given booklets with the instructions .
We were taught how to solder two wires together and how to solder a wire to a vero board .
We were instructed to make a badge that flashed different coloured light by using solder to attach the led and battery hatch to the badge .
Then we had to follow the instructions in the booklet to make the synthesizer .
At first I was quite confused but then one of the instructors came and helped me out .
After that we had a snack and then went on to assemble all the parts together .
We put them in metal boxes and turned them on .
Each synthesizer emitted a loud noise .
When the light sensor is in the shade , the synthesizer emitts a lower pitch , and when the sensor is exposed to light the synthesizer 's pitch raises .
I worked as an Advocate ( Solicitor ) for a period more than four years and from those jobs I gained lots of experiences about minute taking , dealing with clients , arranging meetings and handling cases .
I am a proficient user of Microsoft office packages .
In my first placement I had to deal with lots of cases relating to violation of children rights .
I worked voluntarily for some cases about Juvenile justice like ( speedy disposal of cases , abuse of their rights while they were under custody , custodial death etc . )
I worked on a project about how education the fundamental rights for children under 14 years of age is denied in some community .
This job is related to subject of my interest .
I my second placement I had to perform lots of administrative work including typing .
I had to work as a liase with clients as well as the company officials ( since Shriram Law Consultants is a part of Shriram Group of Companies ) .
The article and the lecture are about the attitude towards taking medical experiments on animals .
The author claims that the main aim of the scientists is to reduce human suffering even if it demands research conducted on animals .
The lecturer opposes this idea , as , in her point of view , medical experiments on animals are not to be taken .
Firstly , the author informs us about impossibility to discover new types of drugs .
The lecturer answers back , saying that different types of medicine have different impact on different species .
Secondly , the author suggests that it is impossible to replace experiments on animals with anything else .
The lecturer disagrees with that point of view , because it is possible to introduce computer substitution or do research on tissues .
Thirdly , the author considers such tests to keep animal suffering to a minimum .
The lecturer argues that as a biologist she used to see animals suffering without appropriate amount of anesthesia .
The topic of the two passages is about future use of hydrogen based fuel - cell engine .
The article states that the most efficient substituer of internal - combustion engines will be fuel - cell engines , because of their several advantages , while the lecture refutes this point by stating hydrogen does not have so many advantages .
First of all , the reading passage says that internal - combustion engine relies on petroleum , which will be depleted soon , but hydrogen will not deplete easily .
The professor contends this point by explaining that hydrogen is , in fact , not easily found .
She adds that it is not directly usable , because hydrogen should be obtained in pure liquid state , which technologically is very hard to be kept under -200 degrees celsius .
Secondly , the article states that this hydrogen use will solve pollution problems , inasmuch as it does not use carbon dioxide , but water .
The professor contradicts the idea by saying that will not solve the pollution problem , because it requires to be purified in order to be used .
She explains that in the process of purefication , a big amount of coal and oil is burned , which pollutes factories rather than the environment .
Finally , the article says that the use of hydrogen is highly economic , because it requires only half of the energy of internal - combustion powered cars .
The professor says that the claims in untrue , because the material , from which the cells are produced , is very expensive .
She explains platinum is very hard to find and without this metal it is impossible to produce hydrogen .
An Unexpected Success
I am a fairly calm person and I am interested in reading every kind of books therefore I have a quiet life .
Last Spring , however , something happened which surprised everybody , especially me .
My little sister wanted to learn to play the piano so she joined a music school which organised a concert performance at the end of the course .
I went with her and I waited for her the whole lesson .
It means that after some months I was able to read the sheet music .
But a few months before the play , disaster occurred !
My sister had fallen down her bike and hurt her wrist .
Unfortunately , she could no longer play .
The teacher said to me ' Could you play in the place of your sister ?
You are able to read the sheet music and I think you will learn to play the piano in a while . '
I was absolutely terrify as I had to show .
However , the teacher persuaded me to try to play the piano .
Only then did I realise that I was keen on playing .
As a result I spent the time playing the piano until I felt far more confident .
The day of the concert I was so nervous that I could n't stop walking .
But when I started , I relaxed and felt like I was the only person in the theatre .
At the end of the play , everybody applauded , never felt I so well .
I am going to play definitely the piano for a long time .
A person who I admire
One of the person who I admire is Martin Luther King .
He was a pastor of Bautist Church and he fought against the dicrimination of black people in the Unated States in the 60 's .
He founded the movement for the civil rights and to free a black people to the racial segragation and equality .
He participated a lot of times on the meeting , like a leader , he went against the law for several times .
He had decided not use the violence in this kind of movements , because he was concentrated about fought against the Vietnam War and poverty .
The other reason for Martin Luther King was the right to vote for the afroamerican people .
One of his most famous speeches was " I have a dream " , where he discrives the equality of the society beetwing waith and black people , where all people can live together .
He was murder in 1968 , in Menphys , he was 39 years old .
Report on shopping facilities in my town :
Introduction :
The aim of this report is to assess the most interesting shops for tourists and make some suggestions .
Shopping facilities :
Most people are satisfied with shops in my town in spite of being quite small .
However , the relation between quality and price of the products are believed to be the most essential points to visit Cáceres .
In general , shops are condensed in a specific zone so that tourists can find what they are interested in very easily .
Suggestions :
In general , tourists think shops should be opened during middayas they are foreigners and like to buy things after watching sights around the city .
It is thought that the best shops in Cáceres are found in the ancient town as it has a medieval charming which involves visitors in that moment of the time .
Conclusion and recommendations :
Overall , the majority of the tourists prefer to buy typical products from the region and besides it is very enjoyable to taste a meal in San Juan Square while people walk around to see the main clothes shops situated in the main street before to go to the heritage town .
Hi Jo ,
I 'm glad to read you and I wish you to come to Russia for you holidays .
You know that Russia is a big country and there are a lot of places to visit .
In our country there are few different climate zones with very rich nature , various cities with old and prominent history and culture .
I 'm pretty sure that your journey to Russia will be a very good and interesting experience .
First of all , you can come to Moscow .
As you know , Moscow is the capital of the Russian Federation , it 's a very fast , energetic city with lots of things to do and to see .
In the city there are a lot of museums and art galleries , theaters and clubs , few parks which priveds different events like open - air concerts or public muster - classes .
Of course , you must visit Red Square , the Kremlin and Saint Basil 's Cathedral .
I strongly recommend you to book on - line tickets to Big Theater and visit it 's opera or ballet .
You know the Big Theater is one of the oldest in Russia with very rich traditions of ballet school .
Maybe you remember the famous Diagelev 's seasons which were popular in Europe in the beginning of the 20th century .
Nowadays artists of the Theater try to keep that old school and develop their mastery .
In addition , few years ago the Big Theater was restored and had gained it 's original appearance .
There is no necessity to describe all sightseeing in Moscow , you easily can find it in the Internet , I just want to say that I 'm sure , you 'll like it a lot .
After Moscow you can visit town of the Gold Ring .
It 's a range of the oldest Russian cities which were centers of the principalities during the ancient period of Russian history .
Here you can feel the spirit of antiquity and the huge contrast between Moscow and provincial Russia .
You will understand that people here and there are very different and styles of their lives are dissimilar .
Hello my friend
You know last week Alex and I went to my favorite band concert , it was really fun , the whole band line up played about an hour and a half , it seemed to me like just a few minutes .
They played all the greatest hits from the 80 's and some other songs from their new album .
People were really excited about the show they just has three attire changes but the show was amazing , the lights and the sound was fantastic .
I could n't wait to listen to my favorite song until they played it , it was the best experience ever , I wish you could be there to see that .
Hope you have the chance to see each other next month .
Wtite soon
Regards .
Terry
DEAR MARY ,
NICE TO HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN .
IT 'S BEEN SO A LONG TIME SINCE WE WROTE TO EACH OTHER .
HOW ARE YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ?
MY FAMILY IS VERY HAPPY TO MEET YOU !
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME INFORMATION ABOUT PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN NAPLES AND I HOPE THEY'LL BE USEFUL .
I DON'T RECOMMEND YOU GETTING A TAXI BECAUSE IT 'S TOO EXPENSIVE .
I THINK THAT THE EASIEST METHOD OF TRANSPORT FOR YOU IS THE UNDERGROUND ; NEAR THE TRAIN IN GARIBALDI SQUARE THERE IS THE UNDERGROUND THAT YOU HAVE TO CATCH AND YOU HAVE TO GET OFF IN CHIAIANO STATION . I'LL BE AT CHAIANO STATION SO WE WILL TAKE A WALK UNTIL MY HOME .
ABOUT THE WEATHER I CAN SAY THAT NOW IS STILL HOT , BUT NEXT MONTH WILL BE COLDER , SO I SUGGEST THAT YOU SHOULD PUT SOME SWEATERS IN YOUR LUGGAGE , AND ALSO SOME HIGH HILLS BECAUSE WE'LL GO TO THE DISCO !
ALL THE BEST ,
SILVIA
Some people claim that universities and colleges should not spend a great deal of money on sports and social activities , as their budgets should prioritize classes and libraries .
However , as educational institutions , universities and colleges have an obligation to provide a wide range of knowledge to their students to help them develop academically and socially .
let us look at an example for a univesity student .
The student had a great deal of assighment and projects , so he spent more time to access the libabry , becoming more ambition to study books and using a computer to search latest information .
Sometimes he felt tired to do papers , going the gym to play basketball .
Therefore , not only did he get high score in the reports that absorbinge a great deal of knowledge at the libabry , but reduce the study stress and maintain healthy in the gym .
I had a similar experience .
when I studied in the university , I sit in the classes hour by hour in a day .
When I finished classes , I would like to access the health center not only to do exercises , but I could maintain healthy .
University , I also have a lot of assighments , so I like to go to libabry to study where is more quietly , spacious and internet accessible .
That 's why I like to go to school in terms of good facilities and widespread information to facilitate me to be a successful person .
Sports and social activities can greatly improve my efficiency .
In addition , my academics education also stand out in my student life .
For these reasons , I maintain that universities and colleges should spend enough money on academic education and social movements to prepare students for their future development .
Academic education will always be at the heart of a university .
In universities , sports and social activities should by no means take the place of a focus on academic study .
I believe that universities and colleges should spend adequate budget on academics as well as sports and social activities .
Teenagers usually do n't know what to study because they feel confused .
It is a great life stage but at the same time is difficult , sometimes teenagers have problems with their families , with themselves , as a result they do n't know whah to choose .
Many times when people leave high school and they go to University , they realised after several months that the career they had chosen it is not for them .
In the other hand when teenagers take a year off is helpful for them to become mature .
You can work , travel , going to an exchange study , rest and do something that you are interested .
A lot of people think is a waste of time , but that is not true .
When students enter University after they have taken a year off fewer people leave the career after several months because they know themselves better .
I 'm interesting in doing a course in your school .
I 've been studying English for eight years and now I want to improve my English level because I need it in my job .
I have an intermediate level and I 'd like to speak English better because my pronunciation is n't very well .
My grammar and writing are good but as I 've said early my pronunciation is awful .
I 'm available to start the course immediately and I want both an eight - week intensive course and an one - month summer course in August , when I 'll be on holiday and besides I 'd like to learning in small groups because the teacher can focus on his pupils better .
In my spare time I like reading English books and going to the shopping with my mother .
Twenty years ago , no one would think of the inventions of Ipad or smarthphone and how they could change our lives , but today , these items have become the necessities of our daily lives ; nowadays , many people just got into the habit of carrying their smartphones no matter where they go .
Advent of science , whether it is in the scientific research or in the designs of consumer products , has changed our lives and will definitely keep changing our lives in the future .
Ipad , smartphone , genetic food engineering , all of them have one thing in common -they changed our lives dramatically .
Take genetic engineering as an example , on the one hand , it helps farmers to produce more corps and meats , on the other , it makes people believe that scientists can help in finding more efficient ways in producing more corps and poultry in the future , resulting in an unprecedent increase in human population , which brings pollution to the environment .
To cope with the problems of over - population and pollution , people need to dramatically change their lives in the next 50 years : they may , among other things , face tight birth control and environmental protection measures imposed by the government .
It is sad to say that the future generations have no choice but have to adapt to the changes in order to survive .

I watched the film one month ago and it has really impressive and engrossing effects .
The film tells about a movie shooting and adventures of filming team which is in Bolivia .
They try to make a film which explains how Christoph Colomb conquered to America and mention about what Colomb 's aims were .
They come across with some problems while they are shooting the film and this supply quite a few strong highlights .
The both of them are imperialism and poverty .
Actually , they want to describe the history of discovery and conquest by a critical perspective but while shooting the film , appear some protests against the privatization of water and the team fall into a chaos and then film starting to give some social , politic messages .
The messages are very important which effect me .
The private companies try to keep public 's all water which is vital to live , rain is in danger ; Even the rain …
The crucial point is transformations and exprerienced contradictions of the characters .
In our imperialist and capitalist World , we need more films or arthistic influences which mention the problems about our life and realities .
I do n't think that there is no future for public transport and I agree that travelling by car is much more convenient .
If the government provide good transport infrastructure like modern and comfort buses , traffic free Metro lines then people would rather to use public transport than travelling by car .
Now a days worlds are facing the big issues like climate change and carbon emission .
Government should promote the good mode of transport in order to reduce carbon emission and people would be encouraging to go green .
Many times because of huge traffic congestion on road we waste our time . while using public transport like Metro save our times .
There are many city in world , planning to car free days and promote to use of public transport .
Department stores are found in all big cities .
There you can find almost everything you want .
In this fast - moving world , shopping is the one of the most important things but I strongly believed it is not always enjoyable .
First , shopping complexes are full of branches of big chain - stores , so this can be boring to walk through them for a long time .
Second , if you ca n't control your shopping habits , you will buy more and more things you do n't need , so that you can have a problem with your budget .
In my opinion there is the reason that shopping is not always enjoyable and full of pleasure .
CONTRIBUTION TO A LONGER PIECE
I always love writing .
I have always loved reading .
You never know what you are going to find when you are reading ( or writing ) and less if you are doing it on the Internet .
There are such an interesting websites and blogs where you can find out something very useful that you would have never expected or unsurprisingly , missinformation .
WHY BLOGS APPEAL TO BOTH READERS AND WRITERS
Many people will find blogs and websites useful in order to meet new people .
We now that making social contacts can be sometimes a problem for a wide range of people , who sometimes find it a lonely and dauting experience .
However , on the internet you can find not only meeting points but practical and very thought - provoking articles in blogs .
In my experience , being under the screen of a personal computer will you be able to show and exchange ideas or opinions easily as if you have to do in front of someone else .
However , both readers and writers not only do it as an altruistic and philantropic way but to get fame and popularity at the same time . Blogs and websites could give them the chance to became famous if they really appeal to a large amount of people and they will abe also available to earn money thanks to the publicity .
Consequently , we should never blind trust in everything we see or read on the Internet .
THE BLOG I FOLLOW
To give an example , I usually follow a blog whose main task is to inform about novelties of new and old series , characters , new seasons and when they will be ready to watch them again .
If they give us reliable information or not , it usually depends on the source .
That 's the point of Internet .
You must n't take everything into account .
To clarify what the situation is , it is truth that not everybody may be interested in blogs or websites but the fact is writing or reading in a blog could give to people a practical way to communicate and share preferencies , beliefs or thoughts , however , more or less reliable .
Peter looked at his whach and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Firstly I want to explain why those words came to Peter 's head .
He was hunting a hot day in summer in the country near Monfrague with Jon , a friend from Madrid .
Jon did n't use to go to the countru , so he did not know how to walk over the stones and he was afraid .
After to drink water form the bottle , he fell over the gress and Peter saw that Jon 's leg was broken .
There was a lot of blood and was then when Peter looked at his whach and knew that he had to do something immediately .
He thought that they must go at the Hospital quickly , so Jon would have a great problem if he lost more blood .
Jon 's face was white and his lips were blue .
Finally Peter ran to the car and went to pick Jon up .
Two hours later they were in the room of urgency of Cáceres Hospital and the doctors were curing Jon ' leg .
If Peter did not had run , perhaps Jon should have die

Hi !
my name is Filip Jönsson , I 'm 13 years old .
I have a sister whose name is Andrea Jönsson , she 's 16 years old .
My parents are divorced ,
my parents name is Susanna and Peder .
I have three dogs , one at my dad and two at my mom .
Their names are Harry , Alice and Bonti .
Bonti is very old she is 13 and she are feeling pretty bad , so I do n't think she will be alive so much more .
Harry and Alice are seven and one years old .
I play basketball on my free time and hanging out with my friend from my old school .
We all have things in common like driving scooter .
We have a lot of fun .
I have moved a lot in my life , as I said before that my parents are divorced and because of that I have moved a lot .
My favorite place on earth is Hawaii .
I will never forget that trip .
On our hotel there was like a water park , it was enormous .
That trip made me a lot of friends , I 'm still holding the contacts with them and this trip was two summers ago .
We all liked it so much so we are thinking going back there sometime .
there was this amazing beach , we could hire paddle boards , snorkel gear , kayaks and other fun water things . and one day my mom and I went out early and hired a kayak and went out on the water and we saw sea turtles .
I had hired a snorkel gear and a water camera , so I took pictures of sea turtle on the bottom .
After a week we went home .
My favorite book is the hungergames .
When I got it I read it five hours in a row .
I like that book so much because it is pretty realistisk and it can happen in real world sometime .
It 's pretty scary of all that happens in the book , all dead bodies and hurt people .
But if you haven't read it I suggest you to read it .
My favorite tv series is called Lost .
I have seen all episodes and I still watching it because it 's so good .
I like it so much because it 's dramatic , action and adventure .
It 's does actually reminding me of my favorite video game , which is called Minecraft you must have heard about it .
Everything is made of blocks and you can build and play with friends .
I have played many sports in my life , like football , golf and tennis .
I have played tennis since I was four years old .
But I played basketball and my tennis at the same time , so I chose basketball , because I think it 's fun .
Visiting museums is essential parts of their travel to new places for many people .
Besides seeing touristic or historical places , and attending open air activities people also want to see museums of the city they visited .
Because museums offer so many interesting and different things differ from other places in the visiting city .
First of all , people visit museums to learn history of the visiting city . We know that museums generally established to expose special and unique belongings which are historically valuable as well as to expose modern belongings .
These old things in the museum give us unique information about the history of the city and its social life .
For example , when you go to Metropolitan museum of art in New York city , you can see lots of historical monuments and items belong to American history and also other countries ' history .
Observing these items you can get idea about the old times of the visiting place .
Secondly , museums are places from where you can learn culture of the visiting city .
Many items in museums has cultural value beside historical value .
For instance art museums include art collections such as paintings from many different artists .
Some of them were made in modern style and some of them in classic .
You can get idea the culture of the city from these paintings .
Third advantage of visiting a museum is that you can have fun visiting a museum .
Beside historic and cultural characters , some museums also can be source of fun including attractive activities .
If you bored to see classic museums you can go to thematic museums such as natural history museum .
There you can see dinasours from old ages .
It can be amazing to see different sprecies of animals which are no more live .
In sum , museums are attractive places for tourist to discover about the city they visited .
By visiting museums we can learn interseting details about the history and culture of that society .
In addition to having lots of information we also can have fun to see interesting things in the museums such as huge dinasours . You may feel incomplete if you do not visit the museum of the new place you travel .
I ca n't agree with a statement that there is no future for public transport .
Today plenty of ecology organisations are trying to raise people 's awareness of the environment defilement .
They say it is caused by burning oil , so the society demands itself to enclose it .
It is often necessary to have a car when living in a small city or village without public transport , and it is understandable .
But while living in a big city , where there are lots of bus stops , tram stops or metro stations is quite incomprehensible that people want to drive their own car and be stuck at a block while rush hours .
As the ecology organisations says , it is better for the environment , and as we decided , it is better for us to save our precious time .
Increasingly people prefer to use public transport rather than to drive a car for these reasons .
It is not true that public transport has no future .
The bigger the city is , the more important public transport is .
And now , when cities are widening , public transport will be more important than ever .
The importance of internet on our lives
The last decades there has been an massive change been in our lives , this is caused by the development of internet .
This had been some positive and negative effects on the possibilities to study and on the social life .
In this essay I will describe some of those effects .
In these days a lot of student are using the internet as a study tool .
The internet allows you to search for information in massive online libraries for research and writing essays .
There are massive online libraries like Science Direct or Google Scholar to find publications of researchers around the world .
The internet is getting important for our study because of the availability of information sources .
The greatest impact of internet on our lives is the use of social media .
Almost everybody have at this moment at least one account on a social media like Facebook or LinkedIn .
The positive effect is that it is possible to be in contact with your friends and family whenever wherever .
One of the downsides you are not able to get away from your bully .
This could drive someone crazy and very miserable .
The greatest impact of internet on our life is the use of social media because you can get in contact with everybody around the clock .
The internet has a lot of consequences on our lives .
It makes it possible to study and do research easier .
Also it gives the possibility to get in contact with family and friends .
There are also negative effects like bullying !
I think we should use internet carefully and keep use it with cautious .
In my life there are too many sports i like to but there is one in particular that i love so much .
It is the football .
when i was born i saw my father watching every day football 's programmes but i did n't understand what it was .
However , overtime i begun to understand how to play and i liked it much more than the past .
In fact when i was sixteen years old i begun to go to the stadium with my friends every sunday .
In italy , football is the most followed sports , specially in my town where played the most important player of the world : Diego Armando Maradona .
He played for my town 's club : Napoli .
He wins two national championships and also an important european competition .
Every day in my town people speak only about football becouse it could give you a lot of emotions .
A football match is something special and you don t see the time that arrive sunday to watch your favourite club s match .
On the other hand , my advice that i give to someone who start this kind of sport is that he must do it with a lot of responsability and sacrifice if he wants to become another Maradona .
Nowadays , most people go by car every day instance of using public transport .
But , is it really necessary ?
Is it the best for the pollution and environment ?
In the morning everyone goes to their job by car but I think that the real reason to do this is that we need to do a lot of things durind the day and with public transport we spend more time than doing the same with our own vehicle .
But , I think that in other cases we take the car without any reason , it 's only a bad habit and maybe we could be changed it to improve our health ( going on foot or taking the bike for example ) and also we will help to the environment and the pollution .
For example , I 'm a commuter and also I need my car to pick up my daughter from the school in the afternoons . I live in a bustling city , I do n't like the traffic then when I get away from the hustle and bustle of the city I usually go to my village .
The car in my quiet village is not necessary and I feel really happy there .
Hello guys , my name is Matteo Davide and I love lot of things in my life , but the most important is one : play tennis .
I play this game four times a week in a really beautiful centre which is called ' Rai ' .
There are around ten tennis courts , one swimming pool , two football pitches and three gyms .
In my opinion tennis is the best sport because I 'm an individualist , so I prefer individually sport , because in these kind of game everything depends from you .
In others sports no .
For example during a foorball match if you wrong is n't too important because you have a team which can remedy , evin if ypu do nothing .
An other reason for loving this sport is that having a racket in hands , for me , is beautiful .
If you want start playing this sport remember that when you are playing every points are important and you must n't relax during the match , even if you are winning with a very big advantage because in a few minutes you could lose the match .
I hope this sport will have more importance in Italy in the future .
Dear Chairman ,
I am writing to you to raise an important issue concerning school library .
I look forward to understanding and I hope we will reach a consensus .
First of all , it is very important to me to determine the basic problem of our school .
For many years we , pupils , have been waiting for library .
Yet , it has still not been built .
Together with an unofficial Student council create a petition which is to raise the issue among teaching council .
Our priority is good preparation for secondary school certificate .
For this purpose we need a quiet place to learn .
Moreover pupils demand is the possibility to borrow books .
It is the most important matter , because most of us is not able to buy highly educational books .
They are simply too expensive .
Our request boils down to the fundamental role of education .
It is broadening the horizons of our knowledge .
Besides issues that have been already mentioned there is also undisputed fact that if our school had a rich computerized library , it would be more representative .
Given the rationality of the above arguments , we , pupils , expect a positive consideration to our request .
Respectfully yours ,
Piotr Dudek .
Our live has changed a lot from the last century due to the technological improvements and society changes .
But how will change the people 's life in 50 years ? .
This is a difficult question to be answered too quickly because we have to take into account that we have not enough knowledge at all to do it .
That 's why we have to describe some important ideas related to this topic .
First of all , as we said before the people 's lives have changed due two important elements which are the technological improvements and society changes .
The first one it is very obvious because every day the researchers are discovering new things and improving the scientific knowledge that allows us to create new invents and improve the old ones .
For example , one of the most important devices that has taken an important role in our lives is the mobile phone which has changed extremely fast over the last ten years .
Another example is the cars which are taking the same way as well as the mobile phone has done .
The second one is very important too because society has changed a lot as well as the people 's mind .
For instance , one hundred years ago was impossible to see a woman working and carrying on economically the whole family alone or studying a degree in the university , things that today are very usual and well accepted in our society .
In addition , there are other conditions and facts that has helped to change the people 's lives such as political decisions , global wars and global economical problems , etc .
To sum up , there are many issues that affects people 's lives and we do not know how it would change in the future , but we are sure that in 50 years from now it would be an important change as well as it happened these last 50 years ago .
Dear Mr Bond ,
I am writing to You in connection with Your request for information on an interesting building or place to visit in Katowice .
At first I would like to tell you that Katowice is a wonderful city , full of great places to see .
The most interesting is the art gallery Oko Miasta , which is located in the city centrr .
It is a very distinctive place because of its magnitude , its outsite look and its atmosphere .
What 's more , in the middle of the biulding there is a small library where people used to buy the newest books and papers .
It is a good place for everyone who wants to get some Polish literature .
Furthermore , in the biulding of the art gallery there is a club Oko .
Not only it is the popular place among young Polish citizens , but also it is very extraodrinary : people can walk the red carpet and drink the most famous drinks .
In my opinion art gallery Oko Miasta would be the best place You can visit with your group .
I recommended it because it is the best place for young people .
I hope my help was useful .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
XYZ
Hit and run
Do you like adventure sports ?
Or do you prefer the relaxed ones ?
If you have said yes , grass hockey is for you .
Grass hockey is a popular sport practiced among people of all ages and it 's more played in countries like Britain , Argentina or German rather than Spain or Italy .
This sport consist of beating the rival by scoring as many goals as possible .
In order to score you should push a small white plastic ball inside the goal using a stick .
In my opinion grass hockey is the best sport you can play as it requieres you to be really focused on to hit the ball correctly .
Besides , when you practise it you must move all your body , because you have to run and guide the ball through the field .
So now , if you 're thinking hockey is for you I recommend you to buy a pair or good grass boots .
And do n't worry if you are not able with sports that involve using a tool you can always be the goal keeper in your team .
It was the usual Friday afternoon .
Michael was home alone , spending time in front of the TV , watching his favourite movie .
While he was lost in the action , a strange and unexpected sound came from his sister 's bedroom .
He continued watching the movie , thinking it must be nothing .
Then there it was again , the sound .
" Hello , is someone there ? " , Michael asked .
Suddenly , a loud bang .
Michael reached for his baseball bat , ready to look into what was going on .
He tiptoed to his sister 's room , knocked silently , hoping there was no answer .
And there was n't .
" Okay , I think it 's time I go in " .
He slowly opened the door , and a cat jumped right in front of him . "
A cat ?
All this was caused by a cat ?
My sister should definitely close her windows , I am going out of this house , I should leave this cat here and let it ruin her things " .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Destination : Disney .
Do you imagine travelling to the United States ?
Have you ever gone to a place designated only for having fun ?
Disney is the dream of a lot of people in the world , many of them have said that it is a magic and awesome experience .
Firstly , Disney is not a common destination like beaches or mountains , it is a place that requireds a different means of transport since it is in a long distance .
The vacatios starts when the plane takes off and nerves and happiness blend creating an experience you will never forget .
When the plane arrives at the airport of Miami you can appreciate the beautiful viwe that thid place offers .
Secondly , The entrance of Disney is incredible and colorful , it also has the main characters in it .
Disney has such a lot of amusement parks whose makes this place fantastic .
Each of one has a different topic and amazing coasters perfect to adolecents .
Although this place offers a very good service to eat , you can bring your own food .
To conclude , Disney has so many facilities that it is impossible to get bord , you can relax in your hotel and have an unforgettable moment in the roller coasters
I do n't agree with the statement .
I think that public traffic will be more used in the future .
Indeed , it is true that travelling by car is much more convenient .
But cars need petrol .
Fossil resources are about to run out .
We have to therefore choose the other alternatives .
For the sake of that the public transport will be improved , instead of being replaced by cars .
On the other hand , more electric cars are produced every year .
This technology will be improved furthermore in the future .
This fact could keep the share of cars .
For the above reasons I suspect that the share of public transport do n't decrease rather increase in the future .
The share of cars could remain because of the electric cars .
But the form of using cars could change .
For example car sharing could increase in the city .
I 'm not addicted to films what so ever , but I prefer to watch the ones that are said to be good and stand out from the others .
Besides that , if I had to choose a type of film I would say , the comedian and the action ones are the most appealing to me if they have a real dramatic and coherent story instead of a fictitious and meaningless one .
Recently I saw some pretty good films called " The Wolf of Wall Street " and " Capitan Philips " , films that caught my attention since the first minute .
Honestly , they lasted for 3 hours but the most impressive of all this is that they were able to create a single world between me and the screen for all that time .
They really caught my attention , they had all the characteristics that I consider the basic ones in a film , not couting with the astonishing actors that made an impressive performance .
All I expect in a film is the way they establish connections between the actors and the audience , in a way that allows them to play with the characters like if they were puppets and to create a coherent and attractive film .
Dear , Sir / Madam
I am writing this letter regarding the announcement in the USA SUMMER CAMPS .
I understand that you required for peoples have good English , energetic , cheerful and hardworking , who that are able to look after children among 8 and 12 , help organise sports and evening activities as work in the kitchen .
I have previous experience working with " ADRENALINE SUMMER CAMPS " coaching children how to play football for a football championship within the summer camps also organized other activities such climbing , running , competitions , expedition and other movement .
Moreover , help in the kitchen to prepare fresh food for children .
During the time I spent coaching , organizing and helping in the kitchen , I learn that the most important thing is to keep a positive attitude and always motivate them in every step of the way .
In this way , the kids are always up for the challenge and do not give up upon their first obstacle .
Y truly enjoy working with children to help them learn and improve their already acquired skills , especially in sports .
Hence the reason I am very interested in this opportunity to coach sports to children during this summer .

Because of him I am what I am .
I think everybody knows the importance of having a person , who is always there .
A person that takes a fixed place in your life and without that person you ca n't live .
My best friend is called Christoph .
He is 1.80 meters tall and 23 years old .
He is a soilder in the military in thun , where he works as a teacher .
In future he wants to get a general .
We have met us years ago , when we were babies because our mothers were and are good friends .
He is a very honest person and has short blond hair and brown eyes .
During the holidays and at the weekends , he wears summer clothes .
As you can think he is a very straight person , who knows what he wants .
But he also can be harmfully and sensible .
For me , a good person to speak about everything especially about my problems .
Although we have many different views of the life we understand each other and are best friends .
Many people around the world follow passionately international sports events .
That could be a great way to stop international tensions , although crisis and wars still exist .
The most important events takes place in some different country every four years .
Of course during these events all the world watch it .
Sports in general are followed by a huge percentage of the population .
Usually I do n't watch sports match , I used to do that sometimes , but nowadays I 've been thinking that it 's just a waste of money and time .
Probably because I do n't like team sports .
I 'm keen on individual discipline .
I do n't want to appear too rigid but I 've seen too many times people forgot the real problem and think only to this thing .
People seems to be distract from their real life .
The point is that we have to make the world better not just sometimes , but forever .
During these events people seem to fall into a peaceful dream where all the country love each other without show racist feeling .
Whereas often we see bad behavior .
I 'm happy about that , but I still thinking that it 's not the truth .
Probably us , as human race necessitate of this kind of things .
I 'd prefer that people express their good behavior independently of international sports events .
On the other hand , sometimes I 'm feeling happy during this event because people seems to be so excited .
In my opinion we have to deal with a lot of other important point related to our culture .
I 've been interested in play an instrument since I was a child .
When I was young we used to have a piano in our dining room because my mother used to play that .
Latent fingermarks are commonly found at the scene of crime .
They are key corner in forensic investigation .
Persistence and uniqueness are the characteristics of the fingerprint .
Latent form of fingermark is invisible to human eye , hence need some methods for visualization and development of latent fingermarks .
Divergent approaches are used on routine basis for development of latent fingermarks .
Powders by adhering physically to the fingermark residue developed the latent , chemical reagents undergo reactions with the organic and inorganic parts of the fingermarks developing the latent , small particle reagent developed latent fingermarks by adhesion to sebaceous content of the fingermarks , ninhydrin reacting to amino acid of the fingermark and developed the latent marks , single and multi - metal deposition methods works on the principle of deposition and resulting in the negative development of latent marks .
so starting from powders to chemicals , all are in public eye .
New methods are continually added in the literature and shows the importance of fingerprints in criminal investigation system .
one can easily deduce information of culprits with partial form of latent fingermark .
Have you ever thought why we need sports ?
As we all know it is an essential part of our life .
I believe that nobody can do without it .
Firstly , sport is the best way to improve your immune system .
For example , playing sport at least two times a week prevents diseases and obesity .
What is more , if you want to get rid of depression or stress - go to the gym .
According to the scientific research mental health is closely connected to the physical one .
As for me , I am keen on basketball as it is my personal way to unwind and work out .
I am into it because it is quite catchy and spectaculous .
Moreover , it is considered to be one of the most active and popular kinds of sport all around the world .
To sum up , I believe that if you want to be mentally and physically fit - try to do some sport and exercise . Also do not worry if you are not so good at it , just keep doing it and enjoy yourself .
Plants have been widely used by almost all cultures in past centuries for medical purposes that are commonly known as herbal medicines ( Izzo and Ernst , 2009 ) .
These are defined as plant - derived substances and occur naturally with no or minimal manufacturing processes that manage and remedy various health conditions effectively ( Bent , 2008 ; Tachjian ; Maria and Jahangir , 2010 ) .
Although , herbal medicines have significantly performed well in the treatment and management of illness , people have increasingly consumed these products via self - directed therapy .
This essay will discuss that there is considerable evidence for the possible detrimental influence on public health due to the increasing use of self - prescribed herbal medicines and that a health crisis is likely if no action is taken by health organisations .
The most recent thriller I 've seen is " The Miserables " .
However , I 'm not referring to the musical nor the intermediate version ; the oldest version is the referenced one .
It is a movie that has presents a lot of richness in characters and historical facts .
You are able to analyse human emotions and rationalise moral situations , so it is a movie that provides a lot of factors .
I found it very exciting because it shows a pre - revolutionary era when Jean Valjean is sent to work as a slave for stealing a small piece of bread .
After he ends his sentence , he has to solve many moral situations that prove who he really is .
It is very profound too , because it shows you problems that could happen but in a minor scale .
What really makes the difference is if you choose to help others or not .
I think people who read the book ( written by Victor Hugo ) , who are interested in this historical incident , or who merely want to analyse human relationships must see the movie .
This is due to the fact that it will teach a lot about the French daily life and about what inspires people to improve and cause good .
As the man left the café , Maria saw that his phone was still on the table .
Then she took the phone and ran out the café .
The man was so far from her that she had to run very fast towards him .
Suddenly , the man went back and looked at her .
She noticed he was Robert , her first boyfriend , but he looked like an angel .
In fact he wore a black suit and a lovely linen tie .
Maria could n't hardly say anything , she was shocked by Robert .
Then Robert smailed and giving his hand towards hers said : ' I have missed you a lot ' .
In purpose of building more necessary networks of housing and transport , areas of farmland , forest and wetland have to be destroyed by many countries today .
Such large - scale building projects has created a large amounts of problems for both human beings and animals .
As to people who make their livings by selling the products they obtained from farmlands , forests and wetlands , they will lose their sources of incomes .
In addtion , farmers , huntsmen , fishermen and any other people that are used to living by such areas have to move to cities and try to find new jobs .
They are less likely to find good jobs because most of them are not highly educated .
As a result , they will not make enough money to afford their livings in urban areas and even face problems of poverty .
Meanwhile , wild animals which take forests and wetlands as their habitas will lose their homes and find it difficult to survive in jungles of concrete . Endangered animals will be harder to be found after the destruction of their homelands .
Also , there will be no fresh grass and grains for domestic animals , such as cows , lamps , chichen to be fed .
To reduce above problems , it is necessary for governments to plan carefully before construction of builings and transport and try their best to decrese the side effects .
They should provide economic support to those who once lived in such destroyed lands and help them improve professional skills to look for good jobs .
Meanwhile , they need to build natural reserves for wild animals which can not easily find another habitats to live .
Although there will be many bad influences of large - scale building on people and animals , the countries would develop better if governments could take efforts to solve above problems .
I agree with the statement that shopping is not always enjoyable .
Personally for me shopping is very pleasant , but sometimes it can be a little tiring .
In my opinion is a few advantage of shopiing .
First of all , if we are in shops , we can buy everything we want .
Another good point of shopiing is fact , that it could be relaxing for some people .
I like buying some clothes or cosmetics .
It give me some pleasure and fun .
Anyway , it 's also some disadvantages of shopping .
Michael was a 23 years old boy , who wanted to be famous artist .
He had very good talent but no one understood his creative mind .
Everyone considered him as a crazy and boring guy obsessioned by his passion ; except Kate , his only best friend , who encouraged him every time he wanted to let his dream down .
At that time Kate was working in an international advertising office .
It was a really busy and hard period for her because her costumers of every part of the Earth wanted something new in the subject of art .
They wanted something that could be traditional and revolutional at the same time , something that could give a new vision of the reality and Kate started to bring some information about many artist .
One night she was working at her home ; she was in difficulty because no one satisfy her clients .
She started to be a little bit nervous , she was n't able to find any solution when , suddeny , she remembered that Michael 's art had the features requested by her clients .
She immediately took the phone and called Michael and she started to explain her project .
Michael was very excited because he finally had the possibility to introduce his view of art throut his pictures .
After lots of meeting and conferences with the representation of China , Japan , Usa and Oceany Michael began to be the man who he dreamed since he was a child .
Now he was famous and everyone respects him .
Everything was going good except his behaviour with his friend Kate .
He started to be very rude and sometimes he treated Kate like an inferior girl .
On day the two guys had a terrible discussion .
Kate accused Michael that the celebrity made him blind and Michael did n't want to listen to her .
Kate was really angry and she oredered to him to leave her room immediately .
Kate was crying a lot but Michael run away .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Enjoying outdoors in my area
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to propose the best places for visiting and to show the wide range of existing facilities which can be used by young people who are going to make a trip to my area .
What Places you can visit
There are many parks and green areas close to this city where young people could spend their time outdoors and having fun during all day before going out , such a park called : San francisco , which has a big lake and local young people are used to having barbecues there , after they had done any water sport or rented a boat .
In addition there are many public transport which could drop you off in front of the park .
where you can have an amazing night
We have an active Nightlife in this city , live gigs are performed from Wednesday to Sunday in several pubs with free access and our cinemas have always had a good movie listing
Whenever I hear about famous actor or singer complaining on photographers following them , I ca n't get a smile off my face .
What 's a description of a famous person ?
Most of the people know a lot about him .
So do n't tell me that famous people do n't enjoy being on the first page of the newspaper or any other magazine .
In my opinion the fame is a need for actors and musicians of the popular culture .
Despite the fact I said that famous people need to be well known , I think that ca n't be applied on politicians .
The personal space in their life should be larger than in a movie stars , but they should make their descisions transparent for most of the population tho .
It is their work to make descisions that ensure the benefit of the people in their country , but we do n't need to know nothing else about them , after they come home to spend some time with their families .

Once upon a time , there lived a boy named Micheal .
He lived in a village near a railway station .
He was very naughty and was not much interested in his studies .
He was a very big menace and the villagers hated him because of his mischievious behavior .
One day while he was all alone at home , he thought of calling the fire force and lied and pretended as if his house was on fire .
People gathered around his house hearing him screaming out loud and within no time the fire force also arrived at the destination .
At the same time , his parents reached the place and seeing the big crowd and the fire force they got horrified .
They ran towards their house , worried for their child .
Every one was shocked and no one knew what was happening .
Later his parents became very angry and even got him beaten up for his mischief .
His parents scolded him and made him make a promise to them that he wo n't lie ever in his life again .
He was even made to apologize to all his neighboring villagers .
He went to his room and felt very bad for what he did .
Micheal closed the door and knew at that moment , he had made a mistake .
last month i watched the Fast and Furious 7 , a film stared by Vin diesel and my favorite actor , Dwayne ' The Rock ' Johnson .
this film was about the previous roberry which had been accomplished by Vin 's gangs leads to the hatred of a criminal stared by Jason Statham .
Jason statham was so strong and made all the gang feel terrible fear since dwayne Johnson was inroaded and heavily wounded .
the chasing of Jason Vs Vin was so exciting furthermore the walkthrough is designed where Vin vs Jason interrupted by another party .
However , both of them did not unite to face the intruder and continued to assault one another .
The end of the story when Diesel get cornered by Jason , spontaneously Dwayne came and fired jason with a machine gun .
The next scene was demolishing of the whole building as well as exploding of jason 's copter .
Finally , Diesel was found alive and get evacuated to the medical center , where Jason was broughted to the jail .
Vin 's family lived happily ever after because the enemy was eradicated and the rest were got jailed .
The film was the last movie stared by Paul Walker as in the film production process he passed away due to car accident .
This film 's Soundtrack , ' See You Again ' , was composed by Wiz Khalifa and dedicated to Paul .
This film will catch everyone 's attention because the scenarios , the action scenes , and drama beyond paul 's death are harmonized rigorously .
Moreover , the special effect which is displayed are so immense and lead us to feel the emotions of the actors .
Dear Marco ,
I am sorry to hear that you 've got to give up either sport or music .
I know how much you like both activities so just I suppose you are having a hard time .
Soccer has always been part of your life and memories of you kid kicking a ball bigger than you are still vivid in my mind .
I still remember the first day we went to attend a soccer lesson you promised me you never give up!. You dreamt of becoming a professional player and decided what your life would be like once you reached it .
You 've kept working on it for almost your entire life now and although you have not become a professional one you have never given up .
However , piano is also part of your life .
When I first introduced you to it you were quite sceptical of your possible achievements .
But again you never gave up and now you playing in the 3rd Orchestra in Town shows how big you are .
Proof that not only you are very determined but that piano was meant to be .
We have enjoyed music together for nearly 20 years and most of our good times are related to that .
As you asked my take what I tried to do was nothing but thinking of you as if you were my son .
I imagined the scenario with Mathew coming up to me and looking for some advice .
First off , I would take him to a long journey by car .
I 'd suggest we take some days off together and head for any particular place he would like to go to .
Then once we get on the car I 'd let the music we had planned before as the ideal background absorb us before uttering any words .
Only after driving for a while I would ask him to tell me what he 's been up to lately and if there 's anything he hasn't told me about but keen to mention now .
At that point I would let his talking go without stopping him from interruption .
I 'm convinced he 'll speak his thought at once without beating around the bush and all his fear and doubt will slip out .
By now he will be able to answer himself many questions he 's been troubling with .
All I 'll have to do is just point out what the main points are that he is too dull to see .
Because that 's what an outside criterion is needed for .
Someone else can just help you think out and be nothing but supportive .
Then he 'll be lost for words as much as he spoke and he will be willing to put the whole thing aside and just lose himself in some drinks , although he hasn't come to age yet for that .
Perhaps the next day he wo n't even be able to recall what the speaking was about but I 'm pretty sure that after all deep down himself he will know what best move on is to make ! !
Let 's talk about sports
Do you have a favourite sport ? I have !
I really enjoy volleyball and horse riding , although my favourite is swimming .
Have you ever tried it ?
You should .
It is a hard sport , but when you are it , you forget all your problems .
Swimming is a fantastic sport , especially in the Summer because in the water you can get fresh .
If you are starting this sport , you should n't be afraid of the water .
Do what you can do , and when you think that you ca n't do it , try your best .
You just need practise .
Everyone should have a sport , when you are doing it , you do n't think about anything more .
You just try to do your best .
Driving my own car seems really convenient for travelling , but public transportation is the most effective way to bring people from a place to another .
Try to imagine that , if everyone in the city has his or her own vehicle , we would be always late due to the terrible traffic jam .
In fact , travelling by car is not convenient when people have their own cars for their family or themselves .
The reason is that we have to wake up in the very early morning for avoiding the traffic jam to attending school , working , etc .
The main advantage of public transportation is that it can transport a large number of passengers at a relatively low cost .
For example , a bus can take more than 40 passengers one time at a low cost .
For another , the subway is able to transport a number of people around the city .
The second benefit of public transportation is that it can reduce the air pollution for a city .
Too many vehicles in a crowned city would increase the carbon emissions .
In conclusion , public transportation would still pay an important role of transportation in a city unless the environmental vehicles are promoted by the government and the roads and highways in a city are managed well for accommodating a huge number of cars .
It 's really important that we do things we should do .
So , we can obtain certain benefits and more doors that can be opened easily .
There are some people that spend too much of their time doing nothing useful although others may say that it helps to be more relaxed in their lives .
Personally , people must dedicate most part of their time on things they should do for two important reasons .
First , you gain time doing essential things .
By doing so , you immediately take advantage of the time in your life doing something essential .
For example , when I was 17 , I was about starting my first day of class in the university .
I started to feel bored with complementary courses on my curriculum because there were the kind of courses that did n't have any help to my university career which is mainly about System Engineering , and I was required to take complementary courses such as Ecology , Laws , and so on .
But later when I graduated , I realized how important were those subjects .
I was able to explain something basic about Ecology that my grandfather had trouble with in the countryside when I went for a vacation .
That experience taught me how important it is doing whatever you are required to do - such as taking complementary courses - without rejecting it , because somehow it 'll be helpful later in the life .
Second , if you avoid doing things only because those do n't like you , you 'll miss opportunities .
You 'll dedicate your time only on things for personal enjoyment and it really will hurt you .
For instance , a friend of mine called Freddy was in a social club in the city , he was requested to do a running around the pool for 30 minutes .
He refused to do this .
After all , one guy decided to do the venture .
He ran for 30 minutes around the pool and when he finished , my friend started laughing at him .
Nobody had noticed that the president of the social club has an award for the runner , and he received an amount of 30,000 dollars because of his effort .
As you can see , my friend lost the opportunity because he did n't like what he was requested to do .
To sum up , it is a good decision if you do things that are necessary or needed at the moment though you do n't like it .
If you do essential things you gain time in your life at the same time .
If you would rather avoid essential or required things you 'll lose many chances to succeed .
So , we should focus our minds making the right decision and spend our time wisely doing what is most important .
Some people think that computers are the most important invention over the last century , while others think that are a lot of inventions over the history that are more important than the computer .
Personally , I think the computer brings many changes in the world , and is for that I think it is the most important invention .
Some people say that the computer change the way people see the world , and this change the way in which humans perceive everything that happens around the world or only in their social life .
For example , how one person can be informed what happens to the other side of the world with only a click .
For other part , other people only use the computer to have communication with someone , have entertainment with some movies , which can be from anywhere , or simply have some fun online with your friends that live abroad or are busy all the time .
In contrast , some people think that the computer is just one more invention in the history of humanity , and although they accept that is an important invention and changes the world , they prefer to say that exist inventions more important than the computer that nowadays we still use .
For example the paper or the wheel .
Overall , people are divided in what they think about the most important invention in the world and what changes these objects make to the world and humanity , I still think that the computer is the most important invention because it not only changes one part of the history like the parper or the wheel , it changes every aspect of the human 's life .
Personally I prefer different movies .
The choice always depends on my mood .
Most of the time I like to watch comedies , love stories and adventure movies because these types of films can help me relax after a hard working day .
I do n't like horrors because they always have a bad impact on my mood .
Therefore I feel more peaceful when I view something funny , adventurous and undemanding .
In my opinion , people watch movies because they want to spend their leisure time .
Movie companies offer all kinds of movies so everybody can choose something that he likes .
I think other media will fulfil these functions as well .
For example , books also help us relax .
Besides , we can learn something knew from books .
Dear Ms Hammond ,
Thank you for your reply , it was so useful , but I still have some doubts and I will be really glad if you could give me this necessary information .
First of all , I want to know what water sports do you offer , because our group of students would be probably interested in doing something related to water , for instance , surf , diving or sailing , due to the fact that they are used to being constantly in contact with the sea ( we live in Barcelona ) and , therefore , they develop a real passion for it .
In addition , I would also like to ask you about the type of equipment you can lend to do this kind of activities and sports I have just mentioned .
For example , for doing diving , are you provided of all the diving gear ( oxygen bottles , wetsuits , security elements , etc . ) ?
That is something really important for us .
As you said , the safety of the students is our maximum concern , we must be completely sure that you will take care of them , chiefly because most of the students are still young and we have a strong commitment to their parents .
Yours truly ,
Jennifer Barraza
In my opinion , this statement could be said for a person who lives in a city with little traffic or a person who prefers travel in a freedom way instead of being concerned about public transport schedules .
However , I do n't think that this affirmation would be correct for a person who lives in a big city , what is more if you take in a count the economic aspects .
The most common problem in crowded cities is that usually they have a lot of traffic jams , and this is because there are too many cars .
Since my view , to use the public transport in this case have two important advantages : the first one you do n't have to care about parking ; the second one you can move in a relaxed way reading a book , listening to music or talking with other passengers .
Nevertheless , having a car in a big city is quite expensive nowadays , not only because the petrol price is continuously raising but also you have to pay high taxes for the car .
In short , although travelling by car is more comfortable and easier than do it by public transport , it is not probably than in the near future they disappear .
Is it true that there is no future for public transport .
As i recognized there are severeal way to improve because we are trying invent a lot of thing every day .
You would not think but when you are just thinking you may have the chance to invet something new and useful for humanity .
Inventors work years to reach their goals they are working with their project like you every day .
So we have the chance to improve public transport .
Using new vehicles , travelling can be more comfortable and easier .Everyone in this world would have a better life .I am really happy when I simply see a new bus with air conditioner or anything which can make travling enjoyable .
Most of the people are frustrated or nervous because they have to use public transport .
If the bus drivers can follow their time table there wo n't be any argument .
Artifitual Intelligent is one of the best way , we can switch drivers to these vehicles .
They will only follow the orders and wo n't be out of time and there would not be any arguments .
In conclusion we have a lot of things how o improve .
We can also help by paying our tickets , yes this is simple but these companies need money to improve their businness .
Help theme and enjoy your travelling .
A hectic day .
It was raining cats and dogs when she realized that he had lost one of the most important things in her life .
Can you imagine what it was ?
In fact , probably it was n't a significant thing for most people but it was it for her .
It was a ring which was given away by her mother .
Probably that day was the worst day in her life , besides she hasn't got married , her sister had died in a car accident , It had been a terrified accident , her sister was driving from Ciudadela and she crushed into a tree .
She was outside the church when a friend of her called to tell the new about the accident .
If I had known that there were full of problems I 'd have gone on travel instead to get married .
Hello I 'm Mathieu Sanabria and I 'm here to deny and explain everything about the case of my sextape , I went to a party with my football team - mates and we were having a whale of time then some girls arrived and I started to talk with one of them , I like her and she likes me so we went to my room to have privacy and I do n't know how but some guys get into my room and started to record my with the girl and I did n't noted then many days after I received a call from a guy that tell me that he have a very explicit video of me doing things with a girl and that if I do n't give him some money he will put that video on the Internet .
I think that he makes a wild goose chase he just bitten off more than he can chew because he does n't know me and I 'm going to make him pay for what he had done .
In other ways I 'll talk about Benzema , he is my friend for many years ago but I 'm not sure if he is with me or with the others guys so I want to listen to their version of the story so he is here to talk about that .
I 'm Nedar Benzema and I 'm blamed for Mathieu 's sextape .
One of my best friends called me two weeks ago .
He said to me he needed money .
I had n't got enough money so I told him .
I 'm gutted because he is my childhood friend .
He talked about a plan about Sanabria .
He set up plan and he made true .
He made a video his friend and Mathieu .
He asked to me how much money should I wanted from Mathieu?Then I asked him how much do you need?He said about one hundred thousand euros and after that I said " you can get it".With hindsight , I was wrong because it was illegal .
So now I regret that and I apologise for this situation .
The Number of the Beast was the third album Iron Maiden relesead .
The British band announced that the album was coming with news , a new singer , Bruce Dickison , joined the group and made the fans completely astonished by his nice - sounding voice .
Most of the songs show demoniac features causing serious concerns on the media .
The album 's name is from the song by the same name : The Number of the Beast .
In this album the drummer was really great and fantastic eletric guitar solos were showed too .
This oddly - named album became the most well - known on the history of the band .
I 'd say that was their best album and obviously they rock
I am living in Chennai one of the populated city in India perhaps one of the most polluted city in India too .
The city is dwell with people , cars , bikes and factories , which turned out to be one of the polluted city in India .
The infrastructure build for controlling and maintaining the environment ecosystem friendly is worst in other words government and people do not care about the environment rather they spoiling the environment drastically .
The government always says the statement they are doing their best to improve environment but nothing as done perhaps they corrupting people money in terms of various projects that controls the pollution of the city .
The government is not only one to blamed but also people who leaving here , who never cares of their environment .
They polluting more than factory does , by using plastic material , disposing wastes in public places and even some people tend to split and use public places as their toilet .
Although many factories and people is polluting the environment drastically but some people and organization is protecting the environment but most often these people are discriminated from society .
But they do n't care about this and continue with there work , often these people tend to demonstrate the effect of the pollution on people and future generation and made some people to change the way look the city but often some most people do n't care about what they trying to say and sometimes these people are scold .
So far people do n't understand the consequence of the pollution but with in decade they will then the suffer and understand the consequence of pollution in their life for sure .
Dear Joe
I have seen your advertisement and I am more than delighted to take part in a summer camp as an assistant .
I am 19 years old and I have 2 younger brothers and a younger sister .
I think I have some experience with young children as I have to take care of my own brothers every day .
In addition to this I go to the gym three times a fortnight and I took swimming lessons for 3 years .
Also I had also taken some self - defense lessons and a climbing course over the Alps .
I think that I deserve to have a job here because with my swimming and climbing knowledge I can entertain the children .
And in order to help them defend themselves I can also teach them some techniques about self - defense .
Anyway I hope I will get the job and I am able to attend an interview at half past nine on Saturday .
Yours sincerely
Andrei
Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , Lula , is a myth .
As the only Brazilian president from unprivileged background , Lula has made history after running for four times for President .
Since he took up the office in 2002 Lula has made major structural changes in Brazil , taking out more than fourty million Brazilians out of extreme poverty .
During Lula 's era , from 2002 to 2010 , Brazil experienced an economic boom as never before and became a world 's economic power .
Democracy also had fundamental changes on that period .
To curb corruption new laws were created , instituions were re - structured and innovative mechanisms were developed to engage and give voice to the civil society .
Minority groups received more attention to protect their rights and investments in education , health and well being increased .
Curiously , Lula is the only Brazilian president without a university degree .
For the poorest Brazilians Lula and his history is to be proud of .
For the Brazilian elite it is unacceptable that Lula , a poor migrant from northern Brazil , overshadowed all the presidents and most politicians of their own , priviliged , university educated and careless about the real Brazilian problems .
Dear Sir ,
I am writing to apply for a job in the USA I saw recently in your advertisement in a local newspaper from my city .
Further to our recent telephone conversation , I have worked as a babysitter with children aged 5 - 10 for five years .
Furthermore , I have worked in some important companies when I finished my degree in Journalism five years ago .
By the way , I had experience in the organization of sport and evening activities because at the university I did a course of Public Relations .
If you want to see my reports I can send you whenever you want or if you prefer to ask my teachers about me I can send you their phone numbers in case you want references from my job .
My teachers have said to me that if you want can write a letter about my experience .
I think I would be a suitable person for the job because I have a good level of English .
Thank you so much
Yours faithfully ,
Ana Fanucci
Most people like to drive cars instead of using public transportation .
In my country people go to work by own cars .
Students go to school or university by cars as well .
As a result of horrible traffic jams took place .
The government had to start a major public transportation projects in order to solve the problem .
Underground metro in Riyadh is one of those projects .
Long distance between cities makes it difficult to use cars .
Airplanes are the best way to travel through long distances .
It 's fast , easy , comfortable and safe way .
Buses are much more convenient for driving kids to schools .
transport workers by public transportation or by buses is more convenient for big companies .
Public transport is a must and cars will never replace it .
Public transport or travelling by car ?
I think travelling by car is a very comfortable way .
Yout do n't have to think about Bus timetables and gates .
You only can go to your car , sit in and drive away .
All what you need is a driving licence , a car and a little bit luck that there is no traffic .
If you go with a train , you need a ticket , that 's not very cheap !
You must know the timetables and at which gate the train will leave .
You have to be fast , if you want a seat to sit , sometimes the trains are full of people and you have to stand the whole way !
I think it 's right , that travelling by car will be more popular .
You drive the way you want .
You can stop wherever you want and there are a lot of other points to travell with the car .
I 've just finished reading 50 shades off Grey ....
It is really good , it is better than the previous novel FSOGrey , i really mean it , It is not porn , BE GROWN UP PLEASE , when you do nt want to read the " sex parts " just turn over the next every single page till it ends , that s all , i hve done like that to finish that novel , This novel is just to tell us the passionate love story between a sucessful business man , chairmen man with stricly unhappy childhood , and only refers to his birth mother as " the crack whore " which related to the his recently behaviour - BDSM and the girl was seemed very bored of rountine life , innocent , did nt know anything about life , Apparently , THEY were so diffirent from each other but somehow , some magic connecting them to be a very lovely couple .
It would bug me if s1 did nt read it to say that is a porn novel
The two maps depict the main changes which take place in Shipsmouth between the year 1995 and 2010 .
Overall , it can be seen that the city has became more modern , with more transport and entertainment facilities .
One striking change is that a new station has been built , to connect the north of the city with the city centre and the road has been pedestrianized .
In 1995 , there were green areas , however they were cut down and an airport and an apartment block were built in those areas .
Another interesting redevelopment is that factory was knocked down to make way for a shopping centre , and in the same way was for Church which was pulled down to take place for a pub .
The urban areas were demolished , to make way for skyscrapers .
A final notable change is that football stadium was erected in the south of the city in 2010 .
I like playing tennis .
I enjoy this sport because of its highly aerobic exercises .
Player is required to run all over the field to chase the ball and to return it to the opponent .
To win the game , a good strategy should be also applied .
One must recognize the field and the strengths , as well as the weaknesses , of his opponent to make a point .
Thus it is a game with a combination of brain and physical skills .
For people starting to do this sport , one can try to train individually .
A wall in a tennis field can be a good start to learn how to hit a ball .
It will be better of course to join a club or to get a trainer to guide .
Information about the basic theory and technique on tennis can be gathered in internet / books .
One should make the effort to practise regularly to make sure a continual progress .
Learning to do juggling will also be beneficial .
Many coaches advise their pupils to practise it for a better coordination of hand and eye .
But most importanly , one should enjoy all of this with fun .
I exactly do n't understand why people want to learn about private life of politicians and film stars .
I have to say that everybody has the right to have a private life although they are famous .
It means nobody should interfere with famous people 's lives .
Unfortunately , a lot of people are interested in others .
Famous people also have got needs .
Megastars can run into bushy problems .
These happenings are not strange .
Because all the people have got predicaments .
But public wants to see famous politicians and stars in every situation .
For example they want to see well - known people with her boyfriend / his girlfriend or want to see them in causal attire or want to see famous women without make - up .
On the other hand , should be considered this opinion : Some of big names are important for someone who has them like an ideal .
Society thinks that they haven't got weakness and lack of ability .
And media appear on the scene .
Media make use of this interest and thanks to this coin much money .
On the scene of TV , media closes their defects or removes .
And all the time follow famous people and their families .
Privacy invasion seems to be an absolute right of media .
However , being able to protect against an invasion of privacy is a fundamental human right of stars .
The government should give to superstars the right to protection of personal relationships and activities .
Ultimately , crowd - pleasing people also have got any civic rights just like everyone else .
Nowadays , many people prefer owing a car more than using public transport .
It is more convenient as you can travel straightly to the place you want to go .
Some may say that we do not need public transport anymore in the future .
However , I think public transport should be kept as it still have their values .
First of all , public transport provide the experience of the journey .
Public transport is not only bus , but also plane and ferry .
They give you the experience of flying in the sky or floating on the sea .
That is the experience can not given by car .
You can not know it if you only travel by car .
So I think Public transport should remain .
Last but not least , public transport can share the cost of traveling .
Public transport is for many people to go to the same place .
More money can be saved as the cost can be shared with the people who are going to the same place .
Third , public transport is good for the environment .
The pollution of many car is so much .
The air pollution make the climate change .
To sum up , public transport still have their own values .
The President of the United States of America Mackinley says that , regarding Cuba , he will not meddle until December .
The newspaper " Times " publishes an intercepted letter written by the Spanish Ambassador Dupuy de Lowe that will make him resign due to what he wrote about the USA .
Next to the blow - up of the North American steamer Maine , the Spanish commission created to investigate this explosion assures that it could n't be done from the outside , but from the inside .
On the other hand , the USA commission brings their results to the Parliament without previously notify their results to Spain and with the opposite conclusion of the Spanish commission .
However , the Spanish government does not agree with the USA 's conclusions and they request North Americans to solve this disagreement with an international arbitrage .
Later , the USA government affirms they do not want to conquer Cuba , but they demand Spain to sign an armistice with Cubans .
Mackinley ask for the arbitration of the Pope León XII in the conflict and Spain reclaims North Americans to get out of Cuban beaches in order to show their desire to put an end to the conflict .
The Pope requests the Spanish army to cease immediately the hostilities in Cuba .
Later , the United States House of Representatives approves a resolution to military intervene in Cuba if necessary .
The Spanish Ministry of State publishes a Memorandum relating all the events and conflicts made by the USA to Cuba until the publishing date .
In this Memorandum , the main events narrated are the filibustery crimes originated in New York and the change of attitude towards Cuba of the USA after the election of the president Mackinley .
Also , this Memorandum specifies the origin of the conflict , which resides in the letter written by Lowe and the blow - up of the steamer Maine , the latter being remarked concerning the USA rejected the Spanish proposition to carry out the arbitrage together .
The 21st of April EEUU denies the Spanish sovereignty over Cuba , the 23rd of April Spain sends the Memorandum to several nations and the 25th USA declares the war to Spain .
Since that day , the diplomatic relations between both nations will be suspended .
Keeping a Promise
Being able to keep a promise is a very important quality of a person .
It 'll show if you can be trusted or not .
So it is not just a fundamental element of being a good person but also effects on your society .
If you can keep promises to your friends , that mean how much you really care about them .
I know how important of keeping promises . I always try to keep them .
But the problem is I do really care about my friends , so I always say " Yes " to my friends , because I do n't want to disappoint them .
And then I always have a lot of promises to keep , and it also makes me too busy to keep them .
So keeping a promise is good , but the thing is : Do n't keep too many promises at the same time ! You should consider if you really can complete it or not .
That way you wo n't have lots of pressure , and you can be an honourable person .

My Husband ...
My husband is so annoying , sometimes he keep talking and talking without any goal , he drops his dirty socks and clothes all over the house and always shouting for lunch , he sleeps in the middle of good movies and important subjects and snores while sleeping .. all he wants to do is too eat and sleep
he says I shop too much but the fact is he does n't want to spend money , he stopped buying me flowers and chocolates and he stopped being romantic
after all of that he keep asking why I have changed with him !
The fact is he is not the same man I have married and that issue upsets me so much .
he keep saying I love you but I do n't feel it any more , I sacrifice my life in my lovely country for him and left my family to be with him but seems like it was one huge mistake as I feel like I am living with a stranger and he is nothing like the man he promised me to be .
anyway I still love him and still have the hope that this is just a temporary period in our life and he will be back to the man I loved once especially that we have the most amazing reason to live for its our beautiful son our angel and amazing love of our life .
There are widely different views on the public transport future .
Despite some people would suggest that such service has no future because people are more rely on car as it is convenient , it is my personal belief that public transport should continue and has its future .
Two of the principle reasons for this are as follows .
Firstly , the society today are more concerned about environmentally friendly .
This is a worth seeing be concerned because air pollution has negative impact on our health and the ecosystems .
The more cars on the road , the more green house gases produced .
Therefore , public transport play an important role to mitigate global warming .
For example , if a bus can carry 100 passengers , at least 25 cars can be reduced on road , solved the problem of traffic jam .
In addition , scientists and engineers are working hard to invent and improve the vehicles , so they become less harmful to the environment .
The second argument is more related to everyone and has great influence .
For those who do not drive , public transport is extremely important .
There are thousands of students travel with public transport to school everyday because they can not drive and their parents do not have time to drive them .
Moreover , insurance , petrol , repair fees are very expensive .
Not everyone can afford it .
On the other hand , public transport is good value of money .
In conclusion , I believe that public transport should have future .
Professionals are continuing to develop a better vehicle to make it eco - friendly , and there are still many people rely on public transport .
Everyone deserves to have a private life , even celebrities and stars , who is a life and soul of the party during their working hours .
We all need a shelter , where we can hide from daily difficulties .
This is the only way to maintain mental health and not to fall into depression .
We can say for sure that stars and celebrities are also people .
It means that in everyday life they are faced with the same problems as we do .
What is more , celebrities as ordinary people need some time to rest and some time to build deep relationship with others .
As ordinary people they need someone to take care of them , someone to share their feelings with .
It does not matter what amount of money is in their accounts .
They are not able to buy real relationships such as friendship and love .
They can gain fame and admiration thanks to their skills but their stage personality is more like a powerful creation .
Sometimes in everyday life they are not even interesting in terms of character and appearance .
We all go through hardships and failures .
But this should not reach a level that it lets us fall into mental disorders .
That is why a private life is so important , especially for stars assessed all the time by society .
Hi ,

I love to help people and the best was I meet members of band and have the autographs !

Learning new languages is becoming a priority for young people because most of them go to study abroad and work with foreign countries .
I believe that knowing more languages is always better . that way people have a lot more culture and are more knowledgeable .
Those are the people who know their way around life .
Another great reason for knowing languages is that people will like and respect you .
You will also develop your mind and learn new things .
So knowing a lot of languages could be very useful in life .
On the other hand , learning languages is not always practical .
It takes a lot of time to know any language fluently and it waists time .
Even if you learn a certain language and you do n't use it manually , you will simply forget it .
It turns out that learning a foreign language may be pointless .
In conclusion learning languages may be very handy but can also be a killing time activity .
So it 's nice to know other languages , but just those you will really need .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I saw your advertisement looking for a kids monitor , and I think I could be the best person to fill that position .
I have a degree in English and I would like to learn how the Americans speak it in real live .
For that reason , it would be a wonderful chance to learn amongst kids and adults in the USA Summer Camps .
I have worked at schools in Spain and I have first hand knowledge about organising sports and activities .
We could learn new activities from each other .
I am a good cook .
Although I have no title , I love cooking .
For that reason , I think I can help in the kitchen .
I could also share with everyone some Spanish recipes .
Nevertheless , I realize this is not the ideal reference .
See my curriculum vitae , enclosed , for more details .
I would love to answer any question you could ask through this email , qq@gmail.com , and this mobile phone number , 666666666 . I would be delighted to attend an interview whenever you see fit .
I look forward to hearing from you in the nearing future .
Yours faithfully ,
Indiana Jones
Michael went to a trip to Poland by himself .
At his 5th day of his trip , he hiked a very high mountain , but weirdly he never seen any people .
About 1 hour after he started to hike , he saw a big cave and there was a cozy - yellow glow inside the cave .
He went in and found an old man standing there .
Next to him were few dozens of doors and there were letters written on it .
The man spoke , " Welcome " .
He led me to a room which said ' Happy ' at the door .
When Michael stepped into the room , I felt something very fresh inside me .
It was like breathing in a forest .
I felt happy .
Really Happy .
The old man said , " You feel happy , Do n't you ? " Michael nodded .
He went on , " Every room have a feeling written on it .
That feeling tells you what you will feel inside the room . " .
Michael went into couple of rooms until I spotted a room written ' Anger ' .
He was curios about how he will feel when he goes into the room .
He stepped into the room .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
I think , that everybody deserve privacy , including famous people .
They can barelly breathing with all those photographers around them .
I do n't know why people love spying famous people .
And magazines are full of those things .
Another useless thing are gossip .
Why are they even exist ?
Thay can really damage the reputation of someone .
I also think that the following famous people sometimes could be dangerous .
For example , when fan follow the cab , she or he could be hurt , because the traffic is really unpredicable or when there is a huge mass of fans , they could hurt each other .
My opinion is , that the famous people deserve a quiet time , when they are with their partners or with family , but also when they are just going to the supermarket or gym .
Yesterday I saw in the magazine photo of Sarah Jessica Parker on which she was walking with her dog .
The headline was : LOOK AT THE SARAH WITHOUT MAKE - UP , SHE LOOKS LIKE A HORSE !
My first though was : " God , let her live her life !
She is only a human being ! "
Why when men stalk a women they forbid him to come closer to her , but when a papparazi hide in car of celebrity , he will get a huge pack of bucks for the photos ?
I 'm going to talk about social networks .
Years ago , we used to get through with other people ringing up or texting messages by our mobile phone and as time goes by , nowadays we also can communicate by social networks such as twitter , facebook , whatsapp ... First of all , we use them to catch up on news , social issues by twitter instead of newspapers , for instance , it 's usually to see people having breakfast in a cafeteria readings news by his smartphone , an image so far from years back .
We also can have more knowledge about current issues by Facebook pages which are not considered appropriate by some TV programmes such as political discussions , strikes , economy ... As far I concerned , nowadays population know more about what 's going on in the world than in previous years .
One example of this could be North Corea or some Arab countries where their Government ban to have access Internet to citizens , in other words , they want to mislead about reality avoiding population could claim bu this nets or up in arms against their system .
On the other hand , we can get more information about our known and unknown people who are our friends by facebook , uploading photos at any time , taking a coffee , watching a football match or spending summertime somewhere .
So , this means we are getting less intimity and becoming more gossiping at the same time , as a consequence of sharing our lives on public sites .
You can follow to your favourite celebrities and have a direct interaction but this also has negative consequences such as some followers critise to them
Michael Xander is the famous team captain of Onix University , one of the most prestigious school in the Philippines .
He was born with a spoon on his mouth .
He has everything : the looks , the brains and the charm but he has never felt contented .
He has never been serious on the entire 17 years of his life .
Everything has been easy for him , he used to get what he wanted .
He thinks that life 's a game and he should surely win whatever it takes .
One of his favourite game is to conquer every girl he liked and break their heart .
But that was until he met Celine .
She was describe as plain Jane of the campus .
The never been noticed girl , Celine .
One day , in the silence of nowhere while Celine was reading a book she felt someone beside her .
It was a new thing for her knowing that someone had the guts to sit next to her because almost all the people on that school define her as a weirdoe .
' Excuse me ? '
She looked up and she was surprised seeing the stranger beside her is the famous Michael .
Curiosity was written all over her face . '
Yes ? '
she responded . '
I 'm Michael , nice to meet you ' he said ..
She was starstrucked .
She knows him .
Everyone in that school knows him and how flirt he is . '
Uh yeah . I know you ' she said .
Michael thought it would just be easy talking to this girl .
Seeing her that close makes him realised that she 's not ugly .
The word beautiful is not enough to describe her .
She 's gorgeous , if she would only take off her glasses maybe other people will notice it too . '
Nice then , do you mind going out with me on a date ? '
he blurted . '
No ' she replied .
This guy actually ask her out and she 's not that stupid not to know his intentions .
She stood up , packed her things and went out of the library .
Michael was surprised .
He had never expected that he would receive a no from this kind of girl that is even far from his type .
She just challenged him .
The past two weeks of Celine 's life changed in just a blink of eye .
Michael did n't give up on asking her out .
Rumors spread that easily .
She knew herself that Michael is just playing with her and she said to herself that she will never fall into his trap .
If he wants to play , then she will give him the best game he could and would ever have .
She 's going out with him .
Two months had passed since the day they dated .
Since then , everything went so perfect between the two of them .
Celine realised that Michael is not that bad and maybe those rumors she heard before were only rumors and they only wanted to destroy Michael 's reputation .
She baked a cake for him because she wanted to thank him for the flowers she received yesterday .
One of the things she knew about him is that Michael loves to surprise , that 's why she wants to surprised him too .
She 's on her way to the court where Michael was practing when she heard guys talking .
' Do you still plan on finishing our bet or the rumor is true Michael ? You have fallen to Miss Jane ? ' it was Nicolaih Heindric voice . '
I 'll do it .
Just be patient .
I ca n't wait to have that car of yours ' Michael said .
Celine knew at that moment that her world had fallen down .
Tears automatically falls down her face .
Everything Michael did for her was just for a bet .
The next day while Michael is on his pad watching tv , he heard his door bell rang , he was surprised to receive someone now .
The last time he remember he never invited anyone .
He would like to invite Celine but he knew she would decline to him again and he 's not ready to be alone with her .
Maybe he 's too coward to admit it but yes , he 's inlove with Celine .
He tried to deny it to his friends because he knew the moment he told them the truth Celine 's life would change .
He knew how Celine loves having her privacy , he knew the moment he admit to everyone that he loves her , she would never have her normal life anymore .
He just loves that girl that he would protect her from everything .
Even if it cost him hiding how much he loves her .
When he open the door he was more surprised to see who 's on the door .
His eyes looked automatically on how Celine looked today .
Is it only him or she was wearing a sexy dress ?
He opened the door wider and let her in with a big smile on his face .
Celine came in and kissed him aggressively .
The next thing Michael knew is that he is making love with this girl .
Everything felt amazing and beautiful .
All they could hear was them kissing . '
I love you so much ' Michael blurted after what they did then hug her .
He felt a liquid falling on his shoulders .
Is it raining ?
he asked himself .
He realised that it was n't raining .
Those were Celine 's tears . '
I knew everything .
Everything was just a bet right ? ' Celine said .
Michael got frozen . '
Everything that happened to us was too good to be true .
I should n't have believed you .
I should n't have believe that you will change just for me .
I 'm just so stupid to believe guys like you .
Now you have what you wanted . '
Celine said with a broken voice and a broken heart . '
Look away .
I 'm going to dress now ' Celine added .
Michael ca n't believe of what he had just heard .
The next thing he knew is that she was gone not only on his pad but from his life .
He just lost the girl he loved for the first time .
Micheal decided to get dress , he was on the way to the door when he saw a box of things he gave to Celine .
Tears started to fall from his eyes .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
In the presentday community shopping is one of the most important part of life .
For some of us trade is a thing for a living , but other people treat shopping like a good thing to spend time and they are enjoying it very much .
For me , shopping is not enjoyable and I am trying to avoid big shopping centres .
The very first reason for my disagreement is that I do not have enough money to purchase everything which I would like to buy .
Things are getting more and more expensive and I am really disappointed when I must go out of the shop with nothing and furthermore it gives me a big amount of sadness .
The next thing about unpleasant shopping are enormous lines .
Going for a few food - stuffs always end with an hour in a line .
No matter in what time you come to shop , you will wait .
The last , but not least reason against enjoyable shopping is that I have to travel a lot to a store in which I can buy everything I want .
Of course I might go to a few different shops , but without driving license travelling is tough task .
Carrying many heavy bags is not my favourite kind of spending my spare - time .
There are lots of good places to visit in Brazil .
Beautiful and important places for the history of this amazing tropical country .
Among all of them , one of the places you must visit in Brazil is the Amazon Theater , located in Manaus , the town of Amazon State , in the north of the country .
The building is important because it was built in the last century during the rubber age , when the city was one of the most richest city in the world .
Architects , builders , painters and sculptors were brought from Europe by ship as well as all the material construction that were necessary for its building .
It is a sophisticated construction , full of details , everywhere around the theater , from the floor to the ceiling , everything carefully fashioned according to that period .
Even if it has more then 100 years since it was built , all the original fashion are still there , intact , with all the luxury ready for everyone 's visit .
The place set out important concerts , presentations and international festivals until nowadays .
The theater is famous not just because of its age , but also because it was built in the middle of the jungle .
During the rubber age there was no urban life around the build , which is completely different from today of course since there is a restored square and a church in front of the theater , that have the same age of the theater and is surrounded by art galleries , pubs , offices , houses , restaurants , where groups of friends , tourists and families are used to go to appreciate the breeze in the end of a warm day and during the night .
It really worth visiting Amazon Theater in Manaus , taking pictures and having good stories to tell in your life .
Have you ever heard about it ?
If you live in a small village , you may know the sport I do .
Most of all Girls Play it in my village .
In big cities there 's a similar Sport called Basketball and this one is more for Boys .
Every monday we meet us in the sportshall of Mandach .
Before the lessons begin , we talk about the news in the village and do some exercise to get warm .
After our Trainer Nico shows us a lot tipps an tricks .
The reason I like this Sport is more or less simple .
I can Play it with good friends , it 's a funny Sport , but it 's also hardly and you can get to your Limit .
In winter we have some games every two weeks , where our friends are visitors .
In the last season we reached the second place .
If you want to know more about this Sport , do n't hesitate to watch a game of us .
You can find more informations also in the Internet .
To sum up I hope to see you soon by a game .
In the reading passage , the writer provides several theories about the purpose of the carved stone balls .
However , the lecturer points out the problems in all his assertions .
Firstly , the author holds that the stone balls were possibly used in hunting or fighting .
In contrast , the professor argues that they were impossibly weapons because they show no damage .
If they were used as weapons , they should be broken up or divided into pieces .
Secondly , the writer claims that the stone balls might be us as standard weights to measure .
Nevertheless , the lecturer contends that the theory is indefensible .
The main reason is that the craved stone balls are different types of stones .
It is because different stones have different densities that their weights are different though they are uniform in the same size .
Last but not least importantly , the author asserts that the stone balls might serve a social purpose .
The professor , however , does n't think so because the the designs of the stone balls are too simple to show the important social status .
Moreover , in general , artifact of social symbol is buried with its owner after he or she died .
However , the craved stone balls were not found near any graves .
To sum up , the professor totally disagree with the statement in the reading passage .
Life is changing every day and in the next fifty years a lot of things will happen .
Science is developing very quickly and nowadays scientists are discovering new things .
In the future some dangerous diseases such as Cancer or Aids will be treated , and there will be no worries about them .
I think people will not go out of their homes to buy goods and foods or clothes , because professional robots will be invented and they will do anything that you want , and they will obey your orders .
However , this can cause a problem for human and some people will face to the threat of compulsory redundancies .
I would say that some problems will happen and people will lose their jobs .
I assume that another problem will be robots , because little by little they will capture the world and they will become human 's enemy , and that would be one of possibilities in the future .
In conclusion , I would say that developing is not very good for human , and little by little the world will be demolished by human errors .
I hope the world will not being destroyed by human , but in the end everyone knows that the entire of the world will be ruined and nobody will be alive .
' The Go - between ' by L.P.Hartley
This is an original and moving love story that has people agaisnt the relationship between the main characters .
And this story was told from the point of view of Leo Colston the lead character .
Moreover , the whole story happens in the 20th century during a trip that Leo does and calls it the best century of his life .

So there he meets the oldest - gorgeous Marcus ' sister and he immediately falls in love and since then the go - between appears in the story .
I think everyone will enjoy this book because it shows a typical way of behaving in the 20th century , their daily - routines and the things they do to have fun .
Besise this , it tries to give us a real idea of what an innocent child may do to help people without being told the real truth .
This paper is a review of scientific researches , including magazines , newspapers , websites and others ; with the purpose of exploring ecotourism , presenting the tourist attractions and beaches to people , in order to call it to their attention in relation to the commercial promotion and local development , where a lot of people do not know the natural beauties of our city .
Warning the responsible departments how much they can do to the city in relation to employment opportunities , tourist atractions , enrionmental education , ecological preservation and make it as the best touristic city of Litoral Paulista .
Throughout the marketing and advertising , we want to encourage young people who enjoy surfing the dissemination of the best beaches of this city to practice it with others that may have .
Preserving , exploring the trails and beaches , encouraging extremist sports are what we believe that attractives to tourists of this wonderful seaside city are .
Key words : ecotourism , marketing , track , the Guarujá beaches , tourism .
In today 's world people use public transport in every aspect of travelling .
Nevertheless , travelling by car can be posing a real treath to public transport because it is much more comfortable .
Firstly , having a car makes travelling much easier .
People can go wherever they want and whenever they want without thinking of buying a ticket or getting to a station on time to catch a bus or a train .
Car gives comfort because you can personalise your space and your ride .
All the same car is also necessity today , because very often that is the only means to get to where you need to .
However , public transport is not threatened by car .
First of all , too many cars make towns crowded and create traffic jam , which is counterproductive .
Secondly , one car is making as much pollution as one bus which transports many more people .
In my opinion , public transport is secured in the future .
It will even get more popular because it will be faster , modern , and cheaper than a travellng by car .
It was the worst night we had ever had .
We had never gone to Michael 's house before .
We were thinking that meeting there we will have a funny night in friends , but we were very wrong .
When we arrived we saw an old house where Michael lived .
He was waiting for us outside .
At first , we did n't think that something bad was going to happen .
When we got inside his house , we saw a lot of old pics on his wall , it was like a horror movie !
Michael looked very nervous too .
After a while , when we were playing one of his Computer game , we heard a scream coming from his garden .
There were two bodies in that place .
They were Michael 's parents , his father was dead , but his mum no .
Then , Michael tried to hide their bodies in a room , without knowing that his mum was alive .
When we saw that we escaped as fast as we could , and we saw as his mum walking to find Michael , like a zombie .
In the end , We heard Michael 's scream .
We never see him again , I think that when Michael closed the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake .
The best thriller I have ever read
It was long time ago when I have read this book but it was so good and exciting that it 's still in my mind .
That 's a novel written by Sidney Sheldon called ' ' If tomorrow comes '' .
There is also a film based on the book .
It talks about an ordinary young woman who has everything she needs in life .
After she finds out that her mother has committed a suicide because of some kind of fraud she decides to revenge her but she gets into a prison .
After she comes out she decides to make another revenge because of the same reason .
This book is very exciting because there is a lot of things that are happening and it 's not monotonous at all .
It has a lot of intrigues and a lot of to think about what 's going to happen next .
I would recommend this book to the people of all ages because it has something for everyone .
It is serious enough for the older ones and it has a romantic side for the younger ones .
It is a really good book that should n't bee missed .
Dear Sir ,
I hope this letter finds you in good health .

This organization taught us how to deal with children , and how to make their lives happier and more joyful .
There main aim is to make the children over the moon .
In addition we were also taught how to organize sports and activities for them in a way they will enjoy .
Moreover , sir , I have taken courses in cooking .
I believe that I am suitable for this job as I have huge experience about what is required . I would be on top of the world if you allow me to be one of the team .
Believe you will never regret choosing me .
Sincerely ,
Razan Salib
Everything happened that summer I spent in Egypt .
My mother had found a new job in some ancient ruins , right in the middle of the desert . I should mention that she was an important archaeologist , known all over the world , and she had to travel to every corner on Earth .
I used to spend my whole holidays at my grandparents ' country house , surrounded by green fields , forest and rivers , but when I turned eighteen my mother thought I was old enough to take a plane on my own and stay with her for a month .
I did n't expect to find anything else than sand , heat and tourists on my way across the desert , even though I was leading myself to a patch of water among leagues of wasteland , the oasis of Faiyum .
Finally , my plane landed in Cairo almost five hours after I had left England and I had to remember that the time there were two hours in advance .
When I managed to reach the outside I had a taxi waiting for me , probably sent by my mother , so at least I did n't have to look for another one in the stifling heat of the city .
On the other hand , the taxi did n't even have air conditioning , so I spent the two hours of the journey trying to fan myself with a magazine I borrowed from the driver .
I reached the hotel well in the afternoon , nevertheless , the air was still oppressive and hot like at midday .
Even though I had to bear the climate , I was happy with being able to see my mother more often than I used to in past summers .
I had n't met her since the beginning of last February , and that was five months before then .
Introduction
The aim of this report is to give some tips for tourist who come to the city . I will provide you with some pieces of advice about shopping clthes in the city as long as some recommendations .
Fashion and luxury
In the city there are many fashion shops where you can get the most trendy clothes . You must be aware that maybe you will spend more money than expected , but if you are a shopaholic , it will woth it .
NANY 'S has party dresses and wonderful shoes that you can use on special occasions .
You would fall in love with them as they are pstel colured .
In addition , they often have discounts and offers , so you can get some bargains is you look into the wardrobes .
Linda is a modern shop where you can find the latest fashion in Milano and luxury complements from the most known companies .
Clothes at short price
Every Monday there is a street market in the central square .
Despite they are not new clothes , they are usually trendy and with high quality .
If the idea of a street marke does not seduced you , I recommend you visiting a is a little shop in Saint Peter street , The Old Bag , where you can buy bags and other complements such as umbrellas , gloves and scarfs .
In addition , The shop is very cheap and you can take a cup of coffee iside meanwhile you are shopping .
Recommendations
If you are a fashion lover you should visit Linda and Nany 's .
I recommend you having a look inside just in case .
By contrast If you are more lickely to save money , the best option in the street market .
I suggest a quick visit to every shop and make comparations in price and quality
A group of young people from abroad will be visiting my home town for three months .
This is a short report which will include my recommendation about the most interesting places in my town for them to enjoy .
I have chosen two most popular places to have a good time in my town .
The first place would be " Culture Centre " and the second one " Sports Centre " .
In the " Culture Centre " your young visitors will be able to join daily cultural activities , such as theater , cinema and drawing classes , whereas in the " Sports Centre " they will have an opportunity to join many sports activities , such as bowling , swimming , athletics and karate classes .
Additionally , since the young people are going to stay in my town for a few months , I suggest that they should subscribe to a Polish language course .
It is very helpful to be communicative in Polish language at least on a basic level .
The course would be three times a week only , and fully paid by the Polish government .
The course will give your young visitors not only a lot of fun but also a general knowledge about Polish culture and eating habits as well .
In short , a trip to Poland will be an unforgettable experience for your students .
However , they should be aware of high costs of living in my town .
When I think in food the first thought it comes to my mind is ham , it brings back memories of the Christmas 2012 .
I have fond memories of those Christmas because of the ham and my niece .
In recent years , I have been buying the ham in a shop in Cáceres which is hugely popular and I really enjoy seeing that my family is delighted , but overall I enjoy seeing my niece , who is still a child , eating ham .
Every year , in my house , we play the same role : my mother and my sister prepare different plates for Christmas dinner , and I am highly probably the responsible for carrying those plates from the kitchen to the dining room , because the rest of the family is lost in their conversations trying to save the world .
It was while I was coming in and out from the kitchen I found my niece standing on a side of the table eating ham .
I do n't know how she took the plate from the centre of the table and put it in front of her , but she had started to eat it , without asking anyone .
It was an unforgettable moment , I was looking at her slightly excited because she was eating alone without help and fast , which was and still is unusual coming from her .
If there were more buses or trains at any time ( also in the night ) , it could be convenient using them and letting the car in the garage .
Unfortunately it 's not possible because of the costs that the Economic System would be compelled to support .
So people often prefer using the car and paying for oil instead of the bus ticket but having more advantages : not to be constricted to wait for the buses and not to have to take a taxi in the night when they come back from the disco , for example ..
Recently , in many towns , there is also a new system for moving around the city .
It 's called " City car " or " Car Sharing " and it consists in sharing a car , using it for our movements and then letting it in every part of the city in the dedicated parking .
It 's a cheap service and it 's very appreciated from people who needs car not every day but only for a little time .
So I think that in a short time , cars will take the place of the public transport .
The Internship , a film of Shawn Levy with Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn .
In this film there are two not younger men who have lost their work .
They sell clocks , but at a certain time their factory had closed .
They have to find another work .
It is n't easy finding another work for them because they are alone able to sell .
In the beginning , one of them , looks for a job asking to the boyfriend sister , but fortunately his friend convince him to find another work .
One day , finding on google , the two friends discover that google looks for new people to employ in its company .
They send their curriculum .
Of course they are much more older than the other candidates , and when the staff control their curriculum only one member confirm their candidature .
Despite everything they could take part to the competition .
The google agency arranges a lot of people , and declares that only one group will have the possibility to win .
Of course when the groups arrange themselves , the two old men remain alone and they are forced to create a group with the discards .
Of course , on paper , this group haven't chances , but the events will demonstrate something of different .
This film is interested because it drafts work problems but not only for this ; it also transmits some important values like , the importance of the solidarity , the group cohesion and the importance not to lose the fait in dreams even if the situation is withstands .
Of course there are also negative observations about this film : for example there are some pornographic scenes in the middle of the story : they are n't interesting and they during so much time .
In addition some situations of the film are taken from the high school movie .
In conclusion this film is plain and a little discounted but in the same time light and funny film to watch during the summer with some friends .
Dear Jo ,
I 'm very happy to hear that you have chosen to come to my country ! I 'm sure you 'll love it because you had a great time the last time you came .
If I were you , I would start in Catalonia and I would catch a train which describes a wonderful route .
You travel around all the Spanish coast and you end your trip in Madrid .
So you can see nearly all Spain in a month and it is quite worth , according to my best friend .
The problem is that you have to book the hotels you want to stay so yoou need some time to prepare it .
You should bring summer clothes because it 's very hot at his time of the year , and some jackets since the north of this country can be a little chilly too .
As you know , my father runs a tour agency which needs some new staff and they are looking for people who speak at least three languages .
I think you 're suitable for this job as you can speak German , English and French .
It is well - paid although you have to spend hours and hours under the sun , but it 's a good idea .
It may help you to choose what to study at university as I know you haven't decided your mind yet .
If you do n't like this idea , there is an excellent website which offers a lot of jobs and maybe you find something interesting .
I enclose for you the name in this e - mail , I think you should take a look !
Please , tell me when you make a decision .
Yours sincerely .
I think that there are different types of famous people .
The most are famous because they expose their private life and all their interests are to making money .
The rest of celebrities are artists or good workers .
They do not think in money or fame , simply they enjoy working .
On the one hand , I agree with the statement because everyone has the right to maintain a private life .
It has to be uncomfortable to go out of your house and find some reporters or paparazzi waiting for you to asking or to taking photos .
If something changes in your life will be a notice in television , and people will invent rumours about you .
Not know if people take interest in you because they are real fans or is a person who wants to take advantage of you .
On the other hand , I disagree with the statement because if they are public people , fans will interest in them .
There are celebrities that sell their life in television and then do not want to journalists chase them .
There are other famous people who not appear in television and they are chased by reporters .
This is the result that something new has occurred and they want to collect information .
It is impossible to take a private life if you are a celebrity , because people who love you want to know about your privacy .
To summarize , if you expose yourself to television you will not have a private life .
The best way to keep it is not be a famous person .
To whom it may concern ,
I would like to apply for the job of instructor in the USA Summer Camp as advertised in the newspaper .
Last winter I had been working as a coach in my basketball team with kids about ten years old .
I have formation in basketball and Physical Educations .
For me this is very pleasant because I like being with children and it is a challenge for me .
Moreover I am very active and hardworking as you request .
In addition I am very funny and always I am joking .
It is not a problem for me to work in the kitchens because I cook on my house and I think I do very well .
I think this job is perfect for me because I love children and sport .
Also I feel that I can be a positive incorporation in the Summer Camps .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely

Have you ever thought about how the home of the Future would look like ?
It would be different from nowadays ?
Many of us think that the home of the future will be exactly like in our favourite sciean - ficions movies or books , for example , " Solaris " or even " Star Wars " .
House , which in we will be life in the future , would be full of complicated to use computers and robots .
Televion of the future will be amiazing , because it will have a 3D projector , what makes that movies will look extremely realistic .
Remarkable will be of course robots , which will help us in every day responsibilities , for instance in cooking delicious dishes , cleaning every thing in the house or even in washing and ironing clothes .
To be perfectly honest , ever human - being is dreaming of the home of the Future and ever dream is an individual , but in the future , our dreams will come true ?
Hi ,
Whether you want to visit some interesting place or building , you should go to our zoo , which is near Zlín in Lešná .
There is a nice old chateau and a lot of animals , which are from the whole world .
You can see for example tigers , lions , zebras , birds , pinguins or horses .
In the chateau is an exhibition of snakes and spiders .
And the reasons for visiting our zoo ?
It 's a beautiful place for every generations in nature and you can spend there all day .
If you were hungery , there are some restaurants a fast foods .
But the main reason is , that Zlín zoo is one of the biggest zoos in Czech Republic and , in my opinion , the most beautiful .
Please write to me back and tell me , if you like the zoo or if you went on other place .
Love ,
Jitka
It is argued that famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
On my opinion sometimes stars ' behaviour is very suprising .
To illustrate my point of view I want to give some examples .
On the hand famous people intend to protect their private live , but on the other hand they want to be followed by paparazzi .
First of all being on the covers of rags help them make their more attractive for directors .
The other reason is that actors want to be recognisable , because popularity give possibility to earn more money .
Hollywood fees depend not only on skills but first of all on fame of this person .
Film stars have very duties for example going to the parties organized by other people from show buissness .
Dear Jeff ;
Hi , How are you ?
Honestly , I do not like Nature Programmes so much because they are so boring !
I personally like Sports Programmes and Comedy Shows , because I love sports and also enjoy having a good laugh .
My favourite tv shows are " Hablemos de Football " , " Sports Center " , " Fox Sport " and " The Simpsons " , all these except " The Simpsons " are about sports , mainly football , basketball and rugby .
And as a sports lover I am glad to be informed about the latest matches of the international leagues like the " NBA " , " Premium League " and also the " National League " because of my deep love of sports .
I watch tv about 5 hours a day and in the weekends about 6 hours because I can stay in bed till late .
I watch some football matches repetitions and Comedy Shows .
What about you ?
How is everybody there ?
What is your favourite programme ?
And I would like to know what is the most popular programme among teenagers in your country
I hope you will write back soon .

I enjoyed the past summer holiday , it is entertaining and I usually travel around Hong Kong with my family during weekends .
I have been to several places during the holiday , including airport , Mui Wo , West Kowloon Cultural District , etc .
The summer holiday was quite long , nearly two months .
I usually wake up at around nine O Clock in the morning and spend the day by reading newspapers , books , and also digitalize some video tapes .
I enjoy reading newspapers so I can get updates on the latest development of incidents and news .
Furthermore , it can also improve my language skills .
I usually watch television programs from Discovery Network at night .
Besides , I find those talking about building massive structures and science interesting and I learnt some knowledge from those programs .
To get prepared to the things to be taught in grade 9 , I also flipped through some textbooks , including Integrated Science , Geography , etc .
And I find the knowledge to be taught in some subjects interesting , while some are n't .
As I am a member of the Robotics Team , I went to school for 3 days during the summer holiday to prepare for a competition on fourth of October .
Despite the hard work , I enjoyed the process of preparing the competition a lot .
Nowadays the level of our life has become higher .
We are looking for better conditions everywhere .
So a public transport is not exception .
Most people prefer using their private car instead of a public transport .
Basically , there are a lot of drawbacks using this kind of transport .
First of all is a traffic jam , if you stick in a traffic jam in a big bus you will waste much time then you expected on the road . Bisedes a public transport are overloaded at rush hours .Another downside is that most of buses are old and dirty .
That 's why people choose travelling by car because it ' is more convenient and fast .
ALL ABOUT ME

I am 12 years old and I was born on September , 12 2003 .
Most of my time I like hanging out and chilling with my friends , but when I am not with my friends , I am home studying .
I have one big sister , Anisa , she is 18 years old , and I also have two younger sisters ; Alicia 8 years old and Isabel 4 years old .
I have many hobbies , but one of my favourite hobbies is to ski downhill , because I love doing it .
The reason why I love to ski is the freedom I feel when I ski and it is also my type of sport .
Green And Clean Environment
Introduction
The aim of this report is to explain the way our Community have decided to preserve the nature of our town and which other activities could be useful in order to achieve this purpose .
Schools and Offices
On the one hand , if you belong to a School you can participate giving information to the children about the cathastrophic image our village would have if we do not reduce the pollution in the minimum range .
On the other hand , everyone has the opportunity to clean the streets where they spend most of the time .
It could be the place where you work or your house .
Nobody has to be worried about the vacuum or the broom because it is provided by the Government .
Recycling
In case you do not have time to help with that kind of activities there is a rule you must follow .
You have to throw away every single thing you have in the correct container in order to recycle them .
Recommendations
My recommendation is to invest in a good cleaning machine , consequently we will not have to spend hours cleaning the streets .
A high number of tourists visits Cáceres searching for culture , heritage and typical food from Extremadura .
For that reason , this town has a lot of facilities to cover that demand and to offer a good time inside .
The most attractive resource in Cáceres is its heritage .
The old town is an historic and cultural center where a great part of the tourism is focused in .
This part of the city is ready to receive it because there is an intensive control to have access to the old town with cars .
Anyway , taxis and official vehicles are free to enter whenever they want .
One of the most particular things of this region is the food and Cáceres is the head city of gastronomy in Europe .
Currently , Cáceres is the only Spanish city having a European award for offering a big selection of food and drink .
" Atrio " is the most important restaurant of the city and it has been recognised with two stars of the most famous guide for restaurant from Spain .
Anyway , " Atrio " is not just a fine food restaurant , but it is a five - stars hotel in the middle of the old town .
Almost , Cáceres has a great offer if someone wants to buy other things like clothes , souvenirs and art .
Pintores street is the commercial place of the city and it has a great selection of shops and restaurants with typical food from Spain .
Garlic is a plant , member of the lily family , with an odor and a taste characteristic .
It is known by Human history at least since 3000 B.C. In many cultures , garlic is associated with superstitions , providing bad or good lucky .
In Ancient Egypt , garlic was used by people for heath purposes .
The slaves , who constructed pyramids , were fed with garlic , because the Egyptians believed that garlic would make the workers stronger , so they could work harder .
In Roman and Greek cultures , people believed in garlic 's magic powers to avoid the Evil .
Even Homer cited garlic in his odyssey .
In Middle Ages , sailors carried garlic with them to endure long periods in the seas .
In more recent years , in the World War I , soldiers used garlic to prevent from gangrene .
At the present time , modern Science is providing some evidence of a real beneficial effect of garlic consumption in human health .
Experiments made with garlic and some types of bacteria , revealed the ability of garlic to kill some kinds of bacteria .
At least 23 different types of bacteria were tested .
Thereby , the bactericidal effect of the garlic , probably can explain some ancients ' beliefs that this plant can help in some illness treatments .
It can explain too , why the use of garlic was a good option to prevent gangrene in WWI .
Another experiment demonstrated a positive effect of garlic in blood system .
It was demonstrated that garlic has a compound that can make the blood " thinner " .
This can be used to prevent heart attack and stroke .
Therefore , include garlic in the diet can really be beneficial for health as some cultures believed .
How many of us today are really into helping the environment .
There are lot of campaigns going on globally .
Is it worth all the time , energy and money in convincing people to be responsible to their environment ?
Yes , indeed !
I recently joined a campaign program in Manila , Philippines dedicated to protecting and preserving our natural resources .
I was very enthusiastic in all the activities not until after that one event .
I found out that the leaders of this organization are not realizing the beliefs and principles they are imparting to the public .
They are not a good representation of their ideals .
I backed off and decided to just continue to do my personal contribution in helping mother earth .
I believe that if we aim for a change , then the change should start with us .
Maybe we can not convince the whole world participate in helping the environment right away , but it can begin with ourselves .
After my awareness of what was happening in our natural resources , I am very glad to have been doing my part .
I am now living an environment - friendly lifestyle since 5 years ago .
Firstly , I cycle everyday to work .
This just did n't save me from too much gasoline expenses , but it also made me physically fit .
Secondly , I turn off the faucet and the switches when not in use .
Thirdly , I segregate my rubbish .
At home I have separate garbage bins for paper , plastic and organic wastes .
Forthly , I am only buying organic products for consumption and keeping a small spice garden at my backyard .
And finally , I am educating my two children about the importance of what I am doing inorder to help our environment .
All in all , I think that helping our environment does n't have to be big time . We should be aware of the fact that mother earth is irreplaceable nor irrevocable .
We have the time now to do what is necessary .
We can begin in ourselves , in our family , in our own homes .
That is a small start , but will eventually reap a huge outcome .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
My name is Juan Farías and I am writing to apply for a course at the Effective Learning School .
To begin with I would like to tell you that I am really interested in the course because I think it would provide me some professional advantages have in my career as a school teacher .
Learning languages is increasingly important in the teaching sector so I want to improve it .
I would be able to spend three months in a intensive course in spring .
Starting in April or May could be right for my schedule .
I reckon my weak points are speaking and listening skills nevertheless I would be also interested in working over writing and grammar points .
Although I am in my late forties I am still very active so I like practising sports , music and going to the cinema as well .
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours Sincerely .
Juan Farías
Michael is an American guy , living in and studying in the Netherlands at the Leiden University .
He lives in the Netherlands for about a year .
He had chosen to study Amsterdam because he loves that city , it 's his dream city and he loves canals and the Amsterdam 's lifestyle .
One day he went out with couples of friends , they went to a night club called " Miami beach".They were dancing and having fun and then he saw a beautiful girl and she could n't take her eyes of him , so he decided to go and talk to her .
She was very kind and she was smiling all the time , he offered her a drink and late in the night they went to her house where they spend the night together .
The day after , he woke up with a hangover and realized that he had made love unsafe .
He started to panic and put his clothes on and walked to the door .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
I heard a noise .
i looked back and i noticed that the earth was strange .
Moved by my curiosity i dug up and found a paper which contained a map .
Without a second thought i decided to follow the directions on the puzzling map .
I did nt know what i was going to find at the end of my hunt but this idea made the situation even more exciting .
The directions took me along a path towards a cave and i went into it .
I had been wellprepared and i carried a lantern .
I walked through the darkness and finally i arrived at a stunning lake .
There was a boat by the share and as soon as i went on board it started to move .
A few meters ahead i saw a blinding light and i realized that i was nt alone because i could hear the sound of the music and people talking .
Dazzled by the sun when i opened my eyes i realized that i was in a wonderful funfair .
My relatives and friends had prepared a surprise birthday party that i will never forget .
Dear group leader ,
I am writing in connection with your stay in Cracow .
I know you 're looking for interesting place to visit so I want to offer you place where you can rest , have a lot of fun and spend great time with your group .
I want to recommend the amusement park , one of the most interesting place to visit here .
On the face of it it sounds childishly but I think it 's a good way to spend free time even for adults .
This is a huge amusement park with many attraction for young people looking for excitement .
There are many carousels , go - carts , slides .
There 's also something for someone who do n't like risky play .
I 'm thinking of an aqua park where you can not only swim but also take advantage of SPA , jacuzzi , sauna .
The amusement park and aqua park are located close the centre so you do n't have to go far away .
I hope that you will take advantage of my proposal .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
XYZ
The picture shows clearly the process of making bank notes .
As is shown in the picture , we can obviously see that four main steps make up the process .
First and formast , the bank notes should be designed and the design includes background colour , artwork and securityissues .
Going forward , it should be the preparation of metal plates .
In this step , skilled machinists is required .
Then print the banknote .
In this stage , pay attention to the colour , special ink and images slightly raised is necessary .
Last but most important step is the ispection .
In this step , the workers should tell the good quality sheets from the band ones .
If the sheets is in good quality , it will be cut into separate notes , packed and
dispatched .
If the sheest is in bad quality , it will be securely destroyed .
There will be a third situation .
When the sheet is partly damaged , it will also be cut into banknotes .
The difference is the good part will be kept while the bad part will be destroyed .
Well , I 'm sorry but , although I studied French when I was young , I have forgotten almost all .
So , I 've tried to translate your French on Google translator and I 've could n't understand what you mean about my English and Google translator . I 'm used to write English and I have an intermediate level .
I use Google translator to find an equivalent word to a Spanish word sometimes .
It is n't easy at all , they 're too different languages , and I prefer to use the software " Grammarly spellchecker " to get some help .
Anyway if you want to know my level I can tell you I 've finished the level B1 .
I will start the level B2 the next course .
I think you do n't know our national team .
There is a new and stunning basketball players generation .
Mirotic , Ibaka , Claver , Marc Gasol ( and his younger brother is all a promise ) Therefore we 'll have Paul Gasol 's brothers at least for ten years more but also , Felipe Reyes , Rudy Fernadez , Sergio Rodriguez , Sergio Llul , Calderón are young still .
I 'm sorry to tell you , but we are going to have an awesome team for a long time still .
About Ricky Rubio :
I think you do n't follow the American news .
You just have to search on Youtube and you 'll find a lot of videos .
He 's improving his game in a spectacular way .
Indeed , his team was almost at the end of the NBA teams whilst they are in the middle position now .
It is n't only that he 's a very good player ( He is :D ) but also , thanks to his style of play , his assists , and points has served as a lever to his team that has improved dramatically .
He began to play as a professional in Spain when he was 14 years old and he began in our national team when he was 17 years old .
His current team is preparing him physically in the gym , his physical form has improved a lot and now is faster , stronger and he 's still 23 years old .
Watching him play is a delight , especially his assists and juggling games while he looks at the opposite direction .
I really enjoy watching him to play a lot .
The " Di roma reataurant " is a restaurant situated in the heart of a small village " Monção " is very popular , between teenagers and adults who love to eat pizza or any other fast food .
As you enter the place you are welcomed by a magnificent setting , a lot of paintings of the city .
Sitting in any table you have a wonderful view of the workshop - like kitchen where you can see the chefs working , so you can see how they make the food that you will eat .
All fast food dishes are home - made .
The chefs take great care in selecting the best quality ingredients .
The restaurant also caters for all tastes by providing a large selection of the best wines of the region , who are very popular around the country .
The service is always great , the clients do n't have to wait a long time until the dish is done , while clients are waiting they always give a Indian food .
The price of the food is very cheap , takin into account the quality .
I had a pleasant dining experience with food of the most exquisite flavours .
For this reason I highly recommend going to Di Roma restaurant .
Hi Jairwoo ,
I recently tried to ask you some questions through your " Ask Me " section in your site , but it said :
However , I 'm Andrea and I 'm from Italy .
I 've followed you for 2 months and I really love your style !
Please can you tell me some websites where I can learn how to style , how to combine clothes and something like that ?
I would like to make my own style but I do n't know where to begin !
whenever I search on Google " men fashion " , I only find stuff for mature men .
The problem is that I 'm only sixteen ... what could I do ?
Thank you so much !
Public transport is not as valorated as it should be although a lot of people uses it every day .
Here are some of my reasons for thinking that public transport is important .
Firstly , it is very good for the environment because it reduces a lot of carbon dioxide gasses which if everybody took the car instead of taking public transport would pollute the atmosphere
Secondly , travelling in public transport makes much easier to travel at rush hours or on those moments in which you should not take the car
Finally , it is a good way of travelling because it is safer than travelling in a car or in a motorbike and also in the way that you are much relaxed than in a car and it saves time too .
To conclude public transport is good for the environment , it makes much easier and cheaper to travel , and it , in some way , saves lives .
For those reasons and some others I think that public transport must be there for many years .
Hello .
I am going to talk about my country .
I live in the capital of Sweden , Stockholm .
A big city with more than one million people .
I live in a little part of stockholm called Danderyd .
Danderyd is n't inside the city .
It 's some kilometers outside of it .
Because Danderyd is n't in the city it 's very much nature and nice people .
So Sweden is located in the north part of Europe .
Between Norway and Finland .
It 's a big country and does n't have many inhibitants .
Around 9 - 10 million people .
It 's one of the biggest countries in Europe if you think about the area Sweden have .
Anyway , about one thousand years ago Sweden , Denmark , Finland and Norway was Vikings .
The Vikings where like pirates that lived in the countries I was talking about one thousand years ago .
They sailed to France and England to plunder .
But they also where the ones that first discovered Greenland , North America and Asia .
The Vikings where feared from most people in Europe but they where also merchants and explorers .
The most people in Sweden are christians .
But because Sweden accept so many people to flee to Sweden from the wars in the northern parts of Africa and the southwest parts of Asia .
The nature in Sweden can be very cold , especially in the northern parts of Sweden .
If you are at the most northern part of Sweden it 's always day in the summer and always night in the winter .
Also when it 's winter you can see something called the northern light .
It 's a strange light in the sky in different colours that is very beautiful .
Some just travel to Sweden just to see it .
In Sweden we have very good education .
Most people go to highschool and unversity .
There are though a problem with jobs .
It 's hard for young people to find jobs in Sweden .
In Sweden we are very proud of a free download able program where you can listen to almost all the music in the world .
It 's called Spotify and have grown super big .
There is also another free program that is called Skype where you can talk to eachother and text eachother totally free !
The gaming community in the world is growing fast and most of the boys that have a computer play games .
In Sweden gaming is really big and there is also one game maker that have made a game called BF or Battle Field .
It have been a great succes and is one of the best games in the world .
We in Sweden are also very proud of our best football player , Zlatan .
He 's one of the best football players in the world and is really popular both in Sweden and in other countries , especially in Europe .
Even though we have a lot to be proud of we need to make a lot of things better .
In Sweden we have a lot of different people from different kultures .
The problem is that there are a lot of swedish people that are razists .
Not the majority of course but there are many razists .
That can be really painfull for those who is n't from Sweden from the beginning .
Or for those who does n't have swedish culture .
Also as I said before we need more jobs .
My home country is Hong Kong , which is a former British colony .
After the handover in 1997 , it becomes a special administrative region of China .
The location of Hong Kong is in Asia , and its location seems to be a bridge between China and worldwide .
Since it is located in a specific area between China and the western , both cultures are also being popular in there .
Despite the land in Hong Kong is just 1,100 sq.km , 7.2 millions citizens are living in there .
From 1980 's , it is developed as an international financial centre and so many global investors have set up their headquarters in there .
Compare with other developed countries , Hong Kong 's economy is stable and competing with Singapore to be the prime leader of the Asia .
For languages , Chinese and English are the main languages which using in Hong Kong .
For the education , every developed country is concerning with the issue .
Hong Kong government has invested lots of capital to develop a better education system for building a knowledge - based society and the better future .
It is providing 12-year free education to every child and they must be educated for at least 9 years .
As mentioned , Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China , those systems and laws are different from Mainland China .
Residents in Hong Kong are enjoying highly - freedom in religion , speech , organizational , activities , going abroad during the life .
Owing to those separated characteristics , actually , Hong Kong can be described as a colourful and brilliant city .
Going places is of paramount importance for people , and going quickly even more ; that 's why I think public transport is not the most efficient way to go places .
The use of public transport takes more time than using the car , which can be considered as a waste of time .
You are dependent on schedules when you use public means of transport , that is to say you can not begin your journey when you want .
You must wait for the right time of departure and you must be at the departure point at due time , which implies getting to that specific place by any other means of transport .
All this makes using the car much convenient due to the fact that not only do you leave when you want , but also straight away from the very door of your own house .
When you go by car you may control your timing , stop at will and if you go with someone else , it may be cheaper : provided the cost of the journey will be the same , no matter how many passengers you take with you ; while on public transport you should pay a ticket for every single rider .
Anyway , to tell you the truth I 'd rather take a train , for instance , it means travelling in a relaxing way , not running risks of accidents , having the chance to read or play " travelling " chess , meeting new people , as in a stage coach but moving faster
Dear Sir / Madam
I am writing in response to your advertisement , which appears in this month 's edition of EnglishAcademy magazine .
As you will see from my enclosed CV , I have worked the last three years as a personal assistant of a director of a well - known international company based in London while I am finishing my part - time degree in Modern Languages ( English - German ) .
Though my mother tongue is Spanish , my English is fluent and I am versatile with different languages .
Throughout my work history and studies I have displayed excellent teamwork and people - oriented skills which I believe are crucial capacities in an administrative position .
As well as I have also work under pressure and meet deadlines without any problem because I am used to be resourceful and manage time efficiently .
In terms of my suitability for reception and administrative roles , I am organized , amiable and helpful .
In addition , I have excellent customer service skills and am highly efficient with the use of computers in a wide variety of applications .
Therefore , I consider myself competent and optimistic to respond to the challenge offered by the post of receptionist in your language school .
I would genuinely welcome the opportunity of an offer to work for your language school .
I have recently moved to York and am available for an immediate start .
Please do not hesitate to contact me for any further information or to arrange a personal meeting .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully
I do n't know what I have to say but the only thing that I know is that my English pronunciation is not very good .
I want to improve my English pronunciation skills so I can be able to understand native speakers .
I have an American girlfriend and she is very fluent in English because it is her mother language .
I want is to be fluent so she can understand what I want to tell her .
I want to tell her too many things about my feelings toward her but I do n't know how to say that .
Now I decided to improve my writing skills because once it became improved I would be very happy and I think that my ideas ' expression will be good .
I think that my pronunciation will be good when I can speak for a long period of time and in all life aspects .
So now I have two main purposes .
The first one is to study a lot of Grammer lessons and the second one is to learn how to organize my ideas for a long period of time speaking .
Thank you for sending me the correct form of my writing and I am really appreciate that very much .
His name is Mohamed but he is normally called Franco , an easier name to use in Italy , the Country where he is working .
Mohamed is from Senegal , 33 years old , graduated in education with a master in education for children and people with special needs .
He completed his studies six years ago but since then he was unable to find a proper employment in his Country .
Therefore , he decided to migrate looking for better job opportunities .
After a complex and difficult journey , Mohamed managed to reach the Italian coasts in 2011.Helped by a Senegalese community , he has eventually found a job as a fruit seller in a local market .
Despite his high qualified studies in education , Mohamed had to carry on a job in a completely different field .
The phenomenon of immigration of people from Africa to Europe seeking better opportunities has become common in the last decades .
However , nowadays even in the rich Western Europe , many highly qualified European graduates struggle to find an employment .
This has become a challenging issue that is leading most of them to start the same immigration pattern followed by Mohamed towards other Countries .
Unlike the post - War society , where the European economy was booming , since more than 5 years , Europe is suffering from a profound economic crisis whose major effects are borne by the youths , including the highly qualified graduates .
Such a phenomenon is also worsened by the education curriculum adopted in many schools , which has failed to adapt to the changes brought in the society by globalization .
Schools and job markets are often separated like two different worlds .
Therefore , once graduated , qualified youths find themselves to face both the economic crisis and a hostile job market .
I believe that Governments from different Countries should come together to find appropriate measures to overcome the economic crisis and stop the vicious circle that leads qualified people to be excluded from the job market and , therefore , contribute to worsen the impact of the economic crisis .
My name is Chloé Dubé and I am both Italian and French .
I go cycling and running regularly so I think I could define myself a sportswoman .
I am a passionate reader in particular of thrillers and French poetry .
My passion for travels goes back in years to when I was just a child : As I am a curious person I like tasting new foods and discover new places .
I like to think of myself as a go - getter so I always try to keep myself active .
I am not a class act yet I try to do my best , so if I have to work in a team I am the mover and shaker of the group .
However , as I tend to be set in my ways sometimes I can appear a know - it - all or too pragmatic .
I would like to be part of this project as next year I will have to live at miles of distance from my parents in order to study Medicine .
Therefore I think this experience of three months can offer me a unique chance of growing as a person and better understand if I am actually ready to be 100% independent .
I think this experience is the challenge that I need in order to become more mature and responsible .
I believe that this project is the smartest way to spend my summer .
Indeed following a routine of work would allow me to put my mind in gear and study two or three hours a day .
In addition probably this project is the best chance of really getting to know more about the Baltic Republics .
A couple years ago I have spent a couple weeks in Bright with Ef .
During this period I have shared a room with two Finnish girls in a foster family .
We got on like a house on fire and I still keep several wonderful memories .
Therefore I would be more than willing to share this experience with another student .
As the 6th of September there is going to be the university entry test for Medicine , I will have to flight back to Italy for a couple days .
In my spare time I am the baby - sitter of an adorable boy who is only 6 years old .
Last year I did some graphic designs for the website of a society called SHIPinSPACE .
In addition , last year I participated in a stage at the ASL of Rivoli .
I am going to repeat the experience in March at the local hospital .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
Is it true ? I agree with this statement .
Why ?
Because , when we decided to go for a shopping and have an idea what we want to buy and it appears that we ca n't find what we want , we are disappointed and frustrated .
Sometimes , shopping - particularly for women - is the best way to ameliorate the mood .
For example when they find what they want , or find something in a smaller size , or just find a trifle and are happy .
Unfortunately , shopping also can bring displeasure .
For example , when we staying at the queue , coming to the cash register and it appears that the price on the label is more expensive .
As we know it , for women shopping is the best way to relax but for men is just a torture .
I think that if there is no public transport in the future , the traffic will be a totally mass !
Because everybody drive their cars and motorcycles on road that the traffic jam will not only be the serious problem to the government but also be the safe problem to citizens .
More vehicle on road that means more car accidents happening .
Therefore , the government need to make a good traffic policy to ensure citizen 's safety and welfare of have privilege of driving on road .
If there is so much vehicle on road , it may cause several problems .
One is that people may stuck in the traffic jam during the rush hours , the second is the more vehicle on road that means the more exhaust would be emitted into the air , the last and the most important is the gas and oil would be depleted .
In a result , I think if traveling only by car is not a wise choice for earth although it is convenient .
But we need to think that there is a better way to protect the earth and human 's environment such as riding bicycle or waiting for environmental - friendly car being invented .
No future for public transport ?
The lifestyle of the people has changed completely in the past 20 years .
Cars are more common on city roads .
Cars Symbolize wealth .
Many people have to travel longer distances to work , and most often their only working tool is the car own .
In addition most of the people are not used to walking on foot even in short distances .
In big cities where people live a more isolated life and always in a hurry .
Even though there are more and more cars on the roads , I do not think this tendency will completely reduce the demand for public transportation for the following reasons :
Traffic jams cause many problems in big cities .
In those cities where the number of the residents is over a million , public transport system is widely used .
One of the most widely used is the subway .
Students often use public transport between cities instead of cars .
There are many people who have experienced a carcrash , or just simply afraid of driving , so they prefer to use public transport system .
Those people who has mental or other serious illness does n't allowed or not able to drive a car , for them public transport system is necessary .
Not to mention that driving a car means you are responsible for your passengers ' life and it is less about convenience even if travelling by car means you do n't need to adjust to other passengers .
I agree with that there is a lower demand for public transport in smaller cities and towns , but it does n't mean it has no future .
I 'm from Ecuador a country surrounded by a great number of natural resources .
We are an underdeveloped country , like other countries says a " third world country " , but I 'm happy about that .
Why ?
, because we see develop countries and the form that they use the resources .
We see what they really are , the underdeveloped countries that they are .
Seeing all of it we will change our future , doing different things that they have done .
Recently my country is starting to develop their resources , our renewable energy as wind , solar , hydropower , geothermal energy .
Nowadays , we really focus on how we can extract this energy , but not in other important things , like the way that we can start to use it , the correct use that we could give them or how we can reuse the energy .
Starting to develop our nation , it is eventually starting an excessive use of energy and hence starting to destroy the environment .
Traditional energies are focus on give to big cities all the resources .
Poor people leave their towns to look for a better live , but if we start to give them enough resources and decrease their migration to the big cities , the need of energy would be decreased .
Also it is a big opportunity to help them .
They need resources to improve their live condition until my country could has the possibility to give them a better live opportunities .
It is difficult to understand a sectoral development where the global interest is big cities , without looking and help the surroundings .
Nowadays my country have started to build a great number of hydroelectric , wind parks and we also starting to think on geothermal energy .
But I think one thing that it is necessary before implementing this type of energies .
All of that require further studies have been done and with that , we could know the feasibility of the projects and the size of them .
Implementation takes time and money , but if the project does not work all of that could be spent in vain .
Sustainability is not about searching for resources and then build large constructions to extract them .
Sustainability is about found the better way to interact with the environment .
It is like to make friendship with nature and knows that what it needs of us and show what we need of it .
Trying to take care of it , extracting only the necessary and trying to cause the least possible damage .
As I said before all of it needs time and a great number of studies .
Starting to interest in alternative energy and try to see forms to use in your native country is the first step .
The implementation of projects not need to be only for spending money .
In a good way implementation of projects helps to improve citizens lifes .
All those little steps help to our nation to build a developed country , friendly with the environment .
I live in one of the most polluted city in India and which is also the capital of India i.e. Delhi .
However , the city has taken various steps and measures to keep it clean and green .
It makes mandatory for the inter - city buses , commercial vehicles and other heavy vehicles to use Compressed Natural Gas ( CNG)instead of diesel .
It encourages people to plant more trees and cutting of them have been made a punishable offence .
Burning of leaves and other waste products have also been made punishable offences .
A large number of huge capacity waste treatment plants have been established to keep the city clean and green .
Recently , for the protection of environment , the Hon'ble National Green Tribunal passed an order banning diesel vehicles of more than 15 years .
Gradually , people of the city are getting cautious with respect to the environment and they are trying best of them to keep it clean and safe .
People are inculcating the habit to dispose garbage at a defined space .
They are conserving rain water using rain water harvesting process .
They are trying to reduce dependency on private vehicles and switching on public transport mode .
They are using more renewable sources of energy rather non - renewable sources of energy .
Installation of solar heater , solar lights , use solar cell watches and driving electric cars are in vogue in the city .
MY FAVOURITE SOAP OPERA .
I really enjoy soap opera I have seen a lot of them , but in my opinion de best one is an English one called fawlty Towers .
It was writing by John Clees and Conni Both and it shows de daily life in a fictious hotel .
There are four main characteres the owner 's hotel a moody man and his bossy wife , and the workers a pleasant maid and a Spanish waiter who does n't speak English .
In every chapter new clients go to this hotel and have a lot of crazy , funny and sarcastic situations , between workers , owners and customers .
Particulary when the owner gives orders at the waiter , this situations became hilarious .
It was a shorter soap opera , only ten chapters , but at the end it seems you know them for a long time .
I recommend it to enjoy .
Its shorters stories have have a funny and relaxed time .
As the technology develops rather rapidly , it 's a world - wide phenomenon now for us to find that large - scale buildings and transport networks are to be built for the sake of human 's economy , which means vast areas of farmland , forest and wetland are on the way of being ruined .
A large number of problems are coming up at present .
Fitst of all , the environment that belongs to both man and wild lives is going to lose balance in the ecosystem .
It indicates that more kinds of species are endagered for they are unable to adapt themselves to the remaining lands .
Then comes the problem of human beings .
Vegetables and other food planting on the farmland will decrease so much that the needs of human may not be meet one day .
Moreover , with the decreasing number of trees and many other plants , carbon dioxide can not be coped with by those natural machines , which will melt the remaining ice in the world .
Thus , the sea level will go up to influence the climate leading to warmer days in the whole world .
As far as I 'm concerned , it 's critical for governments to take mesures to reduce the problems .
Firstly , relevant laws and principles should be put up to forbid extravagent expansion in the natural system .
In addition , supervision of the protecting steps need to be undertanken by the government .
What 's more , the importance of the protection of nature can be emphasized by educating citizens gradually , no matter in campus or in the public places .
Anyway , to key to protect our living environment from being destroyed is to do it by we indivisuals step by step .

The doorbell rang .
When I opened the door imagine my surprise !
In front of me stood a Hare Krishna !
I was alone in the office , it was late and I had a lot of work to do and when I heard the sound of the doorbell I felt really upset because I was looking forward to going home .
Anyway , the man was wearing an orange costume , he was surprisingly tall and slim and he was completely bald except for a long black ponytail coming out from the head .
He seemed the most pacific man in the world , so I was n't afraid .
On the contrary , I felt pretty amused when he started dancing , prancing and singing an unknown song .
It was really hard not to burst out laughing in his face !
When he stopped , he gave me a coloured bracelet that it would make me happier .
I was so glad to have had this comic moment that I gave him a little offer and I invited him to come back again !
UNFORGETTABLE FRIEND
I met her in second grade , we were queuing to go to class , that was the moment I saw her .
And how could I have known that she would change my life forever ?
She was different from all the other kids .
She was quiet , but interesting at the same time .
We became friends when we were 8 years old and we visited each other all the time .
At that time , I did n't have many friends , she helped me to overcome my problems and trust myself .
That is why she is so special to me .
We never hid anything from each other .
We are different , but I think that that is a curious thing about friendship .
8 years later she has become my best friend , my lost sister , my complement .
She was hard to find , but impossible to forget .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
He forgot he had a doctor 's appointment and he was running late .
He finishes getting ready for his appointment .
Once on the car , he starts to drive like a maniac .
How could he forgot the time of his appointment ?
He still needs to find an ATM to withdrawl some money to pay for his appointment .
Once he finds one he pulls up the car and goes as fast as he can to get some money .
He finally arrives .
She was waiting for him .
Hopefully for the next time he will set up a reminder to avoid this again .
On the other hand , public transport is inconvenient .
It is crowded at rush hour .
Pickpockets can have a field day with all the commotion of rush hour .
Because public transport does not operate 24 hours a day , means people have to follow a schedule .
Furthermore , there are certain forms of transportation , such as trains , that do not travel to the suburbs , so people either have to walk long distances to reach the nearest stop or be dependent on one form of public transport to catch another which can be a great source of stress if there is ever a delay .
When it comes to the issue if Pets can be like our family .
Some people suggest that we have to avoid treating them this way , while the others maintain the opposite view .
As far as I am concerned , the later point of view carries more weight .
I am inclined to believe that pets can be treated as a family members because they are loyal , have souls as well as they are human friends .
First of all , Dogs and cats are a very loyal creatures .
There are many dogs who are loyal and trustworthy than many people in the earth .
Pets can not deceive or lie .
Many dogs for example help their owners and protect them from many dangers .
For illustration , My friend has a dog , one day when they were in his farm .
A snake tried to bite my friend but his dog at the last moment saves him and took that snake away .
That is why I love pets .
He made an action which many other people could not .
For that reason I appreciate my pets as if they are one of my friends .
Secondly , reason for my propensity of treating pets as a family member , is that they have souls .
they feel as if they are humans .
They feel our love towards them and they can exchange this love with us .
While they can not express their emotions in our ordinary ways .
Everyone has to treat them in a kind way .
They will never try to hurt any human being so why people try to hurt them .
Domestic animals are a very sensitive creatures that we have to treat them as our babies .
Another point that is worth mentioning is that pets can be considered as human friends .
We can talk , walk and hangout with them .
Many people can talk with their pets as if they understand them .
One can talk with his dog , cat or any other kind of pets as they are their psychiatrist .
They discuss with them many life events .
For example , I have an old neighbor who lives alone with his cat .
He talks with her and plays with her .
When I see him and ask him how do you do .
He always told me that we are fine referring to him and his cat .
After seeing how this old man lives alone with his cat without suffering from loneliness .
I do not mind or fear living alone anymore as I have my friend which is my cat .
To sum up , as a person reaches adulthood , he needs to decide weather to be a human or not .
He has to choose between treating his pets as a family member or not .
I would argue that treating our pets as our friends is an indication of humanity .
Since they are creatures like us have souls and feelings .
They can take care of us and love us in a very interesting way .
That is why I consider my cat my faithful friend .
Hello Paul ,
It 's such a long time since we talked last time .
It was in Martin 's party where there was amazing music and lots of people .
Do you remember ?
I haven't heard anything about you since then .
What have you been up to ? I ' ve just started a new job in an important French business .
I 'm delighted although the weather is awful .
I think the rain will stop when pigs fly .
The city where I live is nice with gardens and what 's more , a huge lake .
I used to go running there .
I would like to see you soon .
Are you still in Barcelona ? We can meet up next month because I will have holidays .
Give my regards to your family .
Bye
Javier

A SEAWEED : OUR FUTUR
I felt nervous when the phone rang .
I was waiting for the answer .
I was beginning to work in a research center about Energy .
My work was very interesting and exciting .
Unfortunately , my scholarship was ending and I was thinking about backing home .
I liked a lot my project and I wanted to follow in it but my project manager was worried .
He was looking for funds to keep our team .
We were five people .
I picked up the phone .
It was my boss , he told me : " Go ahead ! , the project follows ! " .
I hung up the phone and I go out to celebrate the moment with my colleagues .
We felt very happy .
Thanks for a crowd funding campaign , we obtained the mininum funds to develop our innovate work .
We found a group of algae which store energy cleanly .
We only needed a water tank and the Sun .
The energy of the Sun was the food for the seaweeds and they stored it in their cells .
Unforturnately , the process only gone on twelve hours .
Our goal was increasing the storage capacity in several days .
We built a pilot plant to test our investigations in the laboratory .
The public administration helped us when we showed our solutions .
Nowadays , our team have grown up and we are thirty people .
We are going to build an industrial plant to achieve our dream : storing renewable energies without using toxic materials and mining commodities from the Earth .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
He realized that he had forgotten to finish his homework ; therefore , he ran back home quickly , and start finishing his homework .
While Peter is doing his homework , his best friend - Tommy , invited Peter to play football together at night .
However , Peter decided to reject Tommy 's invitation , and continue to do his homework .
Ten minutes later , he felt bored and wanted to play some video games , but he had lots of homework to be done .
He was frustrated .
After that , he took a deep breath on his bed and made his final decision : he decided to keep on do his homework and project .
On the next day , he handed in his homework to his teacher and he got the highest mark in his class .
In this story , we can learn that strength of will is important for us to do something important in our daily life .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .
She was about to start an important trip , an essential change on his life .
Maybe the day itself would n't be extraordinary , but , for sure , she will remember it all her life .
In the near future , she will explain this day to her friends in a pub , probably her new friends .
Not everyday you leave your country without knowing when and why you will come back .
Anna woke up at half past nine when the clock rang .
The first she saw was a perfectly packed suitcase near her bed .
The day before all the clothes which were inside the luggage had been classified on the bed : trousers , spring t - shirts , nightdresses and so on .
She sighed and went to have a shower .
She was doing all the routine activities automatically , thinking in her next journey .
She had lived abroad several times but she never has gone without knowing her return .
On that moment , Spain was an unfair country .
She was trying to find a job for a year but she was n't lucky at all .
She was graduated , had even studied a Master and she had nothing to lose .
She was brave and intelligent , so she was going to start a new life with new opportunities in a different and fairer country .
Her parents went to see her off at the airport .
They were crying .
It was not easy to leave a daughter go on her own .
However , they knew that it was the best for her .
Good luck , Anna .
Nowadays , many people dream of being famous .
They think that big - name has marvellous life with no problems , no duties , or worries .
They think that this group of people has just a better life and things are going very well .
But people should realized , that there are many advantages and disadvantages of being celebrities .
As far as I 'm concerned , there are more disadvantages .
Basically , famous figure has no privacy .
They ca n't go to the cinema , or theatre , or just go for a walk without being recognised .
No matter where famous person goes , he must realized , that next day he will be on first page newspepers with lots of rumours .
Celebrities do n't have an easy life .
I think they have no life at all .
Beacuse , what is proper in living when journalist following every step the famous person takes ?
We all are free people and everone deserve to have his own life .
In my opinion journalist and other people should accepted and respected it and sometimes they should just let go .
Nevertheless , celebrities decided on that kind of life .
They made that decision on their own .
So , I think , that they must have known about the consequences and just live as they like .

Colosseum is the most famous and biggest building of the Ancient Rome and it is also the biggest amphitheater in the World .
The name of this construction is related to two reasons : one reason is related at the dimensions of the building , the second reason is because near there is a bronze statue .
In 1990 the Colosseum was put into the list of the heritage of humanity UNESCO while in 2007 it was included among the new Seven Wonders of the World .
The arena could hold about 70000 seats and the arena was about 75 x 46 meters and about 50 meters high .
It was built between 70 and 74 a .
C.
And it was inaugurated in 80 a .
C.
The name Colosseum spread only in the Middle Ages , in Ancient times it was used for gladiators shows and for other public shows .
Three Roman emperors built totally the Colosseum and they were Vespasian , Titus and Domitian .
The Colosse was often restored because it was often in difficult situations .
Finally I can say that the Colosseum it 's a fantastic construction as for beauty as for importance and if a tourist came in Italy for the first time he should see the Colosseum
dear Sir ,
I am writing with reference to the evening art course that I started last night .
I wish to express my dissastifaction with this course .
The first lesson was about painting , but because of the lack of equipment , we could not painting .
There were not enough brushes and colours for all the students .
perphaps because we were too many people and also , the more people we are , the more space we need and the room was too small .
We felt hot and he had not any refeshment facilities .
Never have I seen such a lack of organization .
When we complained to the course teacher , we were told that things do not depend on him .
He was not helpful and unpolite .
It was the first class , but as a teacher he could have had other behaviour .
I would like to learn in this art course , but you should solve the problems or improve them .
I look forward to hearing your views on this matter .
Yours faithfully ,
Ines Solorio
My perfect hotel would be near to the beach , in the Mediterranean coast , because in this area there are many tourists .
The hotel would be luxorius but everybody could come because the prices would be low , so the hotel would be always full , I think that many people want to go to a luxorius hotel but they ca n't .
The hotel would have many services and facilities like a good reception , spa , wifi conection and pay TV in the rooms , a great chef who did the dishes of the mediterranean cuisine , a swimming pool , a bar in the beach and a boat for trips around the mediterranean sea .
I would like to hear the point of vieuw of tourists to improve the hotel .
This is the hotel of my dreams , but the most important is that the people were happy in their accommodation , if they are happy they will return next year .
One day a friend of mine was going to an amatuer theatre to see a musical and asked me if I would fancy joining her ; I am not fond of musicals , even though I went .
The peformance turned out to be pleasing , with a lot of witty jokes .
The acting was surprisingly emotional , but a bit wooden .
After the show I was introdused to one of the actors , who was my friend 's cousin .
I wandered if he was planning to enter any drama school .
His answer astonished me ; he did not want to become a professional actor .
Moreover , he found being famous extremely irritating .
I , like most people , took for granted that celebrities not only seek fame , but also benefit from it .
They experience gracious living , enjoy glitzy parties and admire their photos in glossy magazines .
Anyway , it is only one side - What do we know about the flipside of fame ?
Do we often think what it means to live under constant public scrutiny ?
Every mistake the famous make is charged against them .
They can do nothing that could n't be gossipped about .
They are even not allowed to have anything for their own .
Paparazzoes make public their day - to - day routine , hobbies and passions .
When it turns out that all who we got used to idolise are just people with their shortcomings , we become disappointed .
We watch mercilessly how celebrities topple from their thrones and even find pleasure in that .
People , it does n't matter if they are famous or not , are just people .
Nobody is perfect .
Why do n't we want to give people entertaning us a chance to be themselves and to have a really private life ?
Hello Beatriz ,
I love MASTERCHEF .
It 's one of the best tv cooking programme that I have ever seen and I absolutely agree with you when you say that this programme promotes the individual and collective work .
I have a friend who went to MASTERCHEF and he taught to the amateur cooks how to make bread .
He is a famous artisan baker who lives in my town .
He told me that it was an exciting experience .
I think that you give us a lot of information about the programme , and your opinion about it is very interesting .
I really like your review ! !
It all began a rainy morning of July , school 's out for 10 days and as a results of bad grades at school , Michael is forced to pass the summer with his hateful and rich cousins .

Dear Peter .

I 'll have plenty of time to do what I want , however I would like to spend my time in the right things .
Can you help me ?

Think about your family , is it important to you ?
It should be because it helped you to be what you are today !
As I am 13 year younger than my brother , our parents stay more time with me than with him .
While he is already working and sharing a house with is wife and his daughter , I need mom and dad to live .
Now I have them almost just for me .
In a family , responsibilities increase with age . I have some , not a lot .
Sometimes I have to take care of my little cousins or my neace , clean my bedroom , not much .
Nowadays Environmental issues have become a great concern for scientist as the problem is growing .
However , layman people seem not to worry about the issue very much .
What can people do every day to help the environment ?
People are not aware that a small change in their lives is of great help .
Water and electricity are wasted day after day , while a little change in people 's habits can make a difference .
Transport has always been a mayor problem .
If the bus was taken more often , instead of going by car , it would be of great help .
Peolpe have never taken into account that fact .
Another mayor problem is lack of recycling .
If people recycles , rubbish will be given a second use , and rubbish dumps will be shrunk .
All in all it seems that if such tiny changes are made , a huge help to save natural resourse will be done .

Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .
She just felt it under her skin .
She always believed in such premonition .
Even though she had forgotten to turn on her alarm clock , she woke up at 7 sharp as she wanted the day before .
The weather outside the window were totally different .
The sun was shining and birds were singing .
She made herself a cup of a very aromatic coffee and she did n't even burn toasts as usual !
She thought that this day would n't be ordinary .
Suddenly , she looked at the calendar on the fridge and realized that today 's her birthday .
Moreover , the next day her party is held .
She quickly packed her hand bag and ran out for a bus to university .
At classes everyone was very kind for her .
Peter brought her favourite chocolate and Kate made a special birthday card with a poem .
Anna got the best mark in the group from the previous test .
The last lecture was cancelled , so she was able to go shopping with her friends .
After some hours in a shopping centre girls were very content .
When Anna came back home , she saw a huge bunch of red roses and behind it Mark was sitting .
She started to shout and cry , because she was very happy that her fiance came from abroad one week earlier than he planned .
What a surprise !
That was the most lucky day from Anna'a life .
Many people choose to go travelling to relax .
Going travelling , people may scheduled various destination and time .
People may want to discover different places in a city , town , even in an alley .
According to the above reasons , car travelling will be the best choice .
Unlike public transportation , there is no limit in your way , no fixed timetable by car travelling .
You can start your journey at any moment , any time .
You do n't have to wait until public transport arriving .
As good as your car is , you can go anywhere you want with your car , no matter which mountain , beach , or city is .
Car travelling makes people feel free during the journey .
There is no need to sit with strangers who may cause in an awkward situation .
You can travel alone .
You can also travel with your pet .
Most of the time , pet is not allowed to be in a public transportation , which not a good thing for a pet owner .
Above all , car travelling is not only convenient but also free in your journey which leads public transportation into a fading future .
The conception of beauty has changed since people started thinking they need to be thin to become pretty .
Sandrine has been a model for five years so far .
She has always looked for perfection .
Also , she admitted she would do anything to have a perfect body .
However , she never imagined how dangerous this job could be .
Since Sandrine became a model , she has changed her diet .
It has been three years now since she stopped having lunch .
Sandrine always skips it because she thinks it is unnecessary if she wants to be thin .
Today , Sandrine fainted up during a runway .
People were very worried about her .
Doctors said she has become an anorexic .
Sandrine realized modeling was a dangerous job , because it can make you change your mind about your own body and diets , and you could easily become ill without even knowing it .
Nowadays , It is painful that not too many people realize how degrading and dangerous this job could actually become .
I had never felt so nervous when about six months ago I decided finally to join the First Certificate in English ( FCE ) exam .
The exam is organized by Cambridge ESOL and it takes place twice a year .
Because I had decided to take my exam in June , it was absolutely necessary to join an English preparation course as soon as possible .
If I would like to pass the exam , I had to improve my English skills .
So , I had started to learn English very frequently and pretty hard .
I had been learning English for the last six months .
I had studied English at least two hours a day and longer .
Very soon I had recognized that the process of learning was not easy as I fought .
I had a lot of things to improve , such as writing and reading skills .
Moreover , I had many problems with the English grammar .
It was pretty sure that a lot of work had been waiting for me ahead .
But I am really lucky person . I had found a good teacher who supported me all the time . I also had some colleagues who had the same aims as mine .
We had been meeting for learning frequently .
We had organized some additional exercises , such as English movies night , a one day trip to London , and a book discussion about English writers and poets .
Because we did n't live in any English native country , we had tried as much as possible to create an English speaking environment .
Today it is a big day for me and my colleagues .
Finally , we take the FCE exam .
I hope we will pass it , because we did our best .
I want to be an expert in such areas as drilling , exploitation and development of oilfield , that is why I want to get a master degree abroad , or PhD at my university .
I think I have sufficient background , my GPA is good enough .
Beyond that throughout my university education , I have been a participant of scientific conferences and I took pains to practically assimilate everything I had learnt during my study .
For example , I have successfully completed « Offshore Drilling » course of « Total » Professors Association and I mean to broaden my outlook in the future .

Hi David

Inside , there are really great photos and lots of articles about all our favourite singers and bands .
There 's going to be a competitions for a month , whit excellent prizes .
The magazine also has a letters page and they pay $ 25 for the most interesting letter or email .
I think I 'll try to write something funny , to win $ 25 .

Subject : Opinion on what young poeple are interested
Date : 27.10.2015
Here is the report you asked for about my opinion ,
what young people are interested in today .
First of all , our generation youth people are more
open - minded and toreant in my opinion .
Music style and
clothes wearing changes very quickly .
Television series
or movies do not really change , young people watch old
shows and new ones by turns , so I can not say what TV
programmes young people like to watch .
Now , young people like different kind of music , I think
pop and disco music is something all young people like .
Because this kind of music connects them on party .
It soothes them , calms them , aggravates them , excites them .
That is why music is very import thing about this festival .
Clothes theme is harder like I said before , because fashion
changes swiftly .
Clothes need to be open and free , simple enough .
We all want to feel good what we wear , I recommend hipi style
clothes , not too hipi , but something comfortable .
Of course
it depends what season your doing the festival .
When autumn , winter
time then I suggest some other style , it has to be comfotable but
fashion enough .
Maybe colorful and cool blankets when someone gets
cold .
All in all , I think those tips help you and I hope you will
give those people one good international festival .

Whether movies and TV programs made in our own country are more interesting than movies and programs made in other countries has been widely discussed .
Many people are of the opinion that domestic movies and TV programs are better than foreign ones .
However , I strongly assert that movies and TV programs made in other countries are better for the following reasons .
To begin with , foreign movies and TV programs are more stimulating .
To elaborate , their story are better as there are more twists and turns in plots .
Although the plots full of turns , they still very reasonable , and not make their audience felt that the plots are very strange .
Moreover , the special effect are better because foreign movies usually cost much more money than native to make .
For example , the first one 3 dimensional movie , Avatar , the movie maker spend a lot of energy and time on developing the novel movie genre .
It eventually made very good impression on its audience , and the most important for a commercial movie , it really did very well at the box office .
Additionally , people can learn more things from foreign TV programs and movies .
Watching foreign TV programs and movies , their viewers can learn not only foreign language but also exotic cultures .
Furthermore , foreign TV are more international and educational .
For instance , we can know many foreign news from watching CNN .
The news in CNN including events which are happening all over the world .
What 's more , the National Geographic and Discovery also teach me a lot of information and knowledge which I ca n't learn from native programs .
In contrast , some people consider that domestic films are more familiar than foreign ones .
They do not want to learn so much becuase they just watch movies for fun .
There is some truth in the claims that watching movies and TV programs is a relaxed activity .
However , I still consider that if people can learn some foreign culture , or appreciate the spirits which foreign films contain , they could get more reflection as recreating .
Plus , watching foreign programs also could attain the goal of those people-- relaxation .
In sum , although there are some dissenting views , one can still safely come to the conclusion that foreign films and TV programs are more interesting than domestic movies and TV programs .
Although movies in our own country are more popular than past , the foreign movies still play important role on domestic movie goer 's mind
With an intense passion in fashion , I aspire to become a professional product merchandiser in the apparel industry and initiate myown branding business with my older sister and her husband .
Both of whom have more than five years of experience in marketing planning and own a large number of fabric sources .
Therefore , I plan to maximize my previous experience with knowledge of psychology , skill of product development design to pursue graduate studies , and build up my ability in the Master of Fine Arts program in Fashion merchandising at Academy of Art University .
It is said that the main objective of telelevision is entrentein people and make their free time happier .
However , television should n't be used only for this purpose for different reasons .
On the one hand , most people have , at least , one television in their homes , so it is very accessible to everyone .
For this reason , instead of entertaining , television should contain educative programmes .
Nowadays , children spend more time at home than before .
They are used to manage different technologies as television or computer .
I think that children ca n't be supervised for their parents all the time because they have to work and make home tasks .
For this reason is important for them having a good educative programme on television .
I ' am not saying that television has to educate our children , but it has to offer programmes which make them revise essential things as numbers or letters .
Television is very important to give language skills to children .
When I was young I used to watch television every afternoon to learn interesting things as geography or maths and it helped me a lot .
Television allowed me to learn how to speak Catalan correctly and it also gave me a good conversation issue to talk with friends .
Food passion !
I like very much to eat , when I can , in the pub near my house .
In this place " Stella d'oro " the owners prepare delicious rolls .
In particular every week you can find " Il panino più " , a special roll created by the fancy of the cook .
Of course I prefer to go to this pub with my family or with my friends , especially if I have to celebrate something , for example birthdays , anniversaries or something else .
I remember , when one of my daughters celebrated her eighteenth birthday , the pub 's owner put the number eighteen , made by cheese on the roll , with a little candle .
When I go there I also drink a good mixed beer : half light beer and half red beer with of a good flavor .
Of course with the roll we also order a lot of chips .
If we are all that we are still hungry we order cakes .
They have many different cakes : profiterol , meringata , tiramisù and so on .
Of course if the six of us go together is quite expensive , but if I go only with my husband I do n't spend so much .
I suggest everyone go to this place because not only is the food good but also the owners are very friendly .
The only problem is to find parking space because this pub is in a narrow road where it is not easy to find space to park the car .
But if you are lucky you can park .
Some people say that shopping is not always enjoyable .
Of course , spending hours in the shopping mall may be tiring .
But it can be also really relaxing and pleasant .
It is said that only men hate to go shopping .
Especially with their mothers , girlfriends or wives .
But also women think that shopping can be an unpleasant experience .
Particularly when we talk about everyday running from shop to shop to buy lettuce , meat or a tooth paste .
It can be really frustriting .
But when we think about going to the shopping centre with our friends it can be fun . We do n't even have to have money , because we can just go and do windowshopping .
Without spending money , we can get inspired by new collections or people that we see in the city .
I can understand people who say that shopping is boring .
Especially when we go from shop to shop but we ca n't find anything interesting .
And I do n't even want to think about the situation when we really need to buy something because of the coming pmor wedding .
But we can do online shopping , which seems to be easier sometimes .
It is a good for people who do n't want to leave their homes or they just do n't like the crowded shops .
We need shopping .
Even if we do n't have to do daily shopping because of our mother or somebody else , someday we will have to go out and buy something .
We also sometimes just need to get new clothes .
Generally , shopping can be seen as enjoyable experience or just a usual need in order to survive .
A most famous person from my country is Mr. John Stefferson , who worsks in a department store and always planning how to make people life more comfortable and better .
He deserves to be famous because he has his own charity and helps to poor families with little children .
Sometimes I lisen to the radio and hear his comments about some global problems in my own country and some suggests about how to make our life better .
The doorbell rang .
When I opened the door imagine my surprise .
There was a little cardboard box with my name on the top .
I picked it up from the ground .
I was just about to close the door , when I heard mum from the kitchen : " Who was it , Bryan ? "
" What is it ? " she asked .
I had absolutely no idea .
I started to open it very carefully .
There was a ticket for my favourite music band .
They had a concert that evening in New York .
I talked about it with mum . "
Should I go if I do n't know , who send this to me ? "
She was surprisingly open to thought that I could try it at least .
It was n't common from her side .
So I did it .
I was sitting and waiting in a concert hall .
The seats next to me were still empty .
When it happened .
In the middle of a crowd was standing my mum with my dad , who had just returned from the war .
I were absolutely excited .
It was the best night of my life .
UNEXPECTED VISIT
The door bell rang .
When I opened the door imagine my surprise ...
There was she , staying front me .
I thought I was dreaming first .
What the hell she was doing here !
How dare she could come to my door!There was no words to express my feelings ...
She 'd stolen my fiancee many years ago .
We 'd been preparing to get married .
I'd been in my country for a while since I need to apply a visa for living in his country .
Suddenly , he 'd cut the connection between us .
I could n't get in touch with him whatever I 'd done .
Every way I 'd tried was useless .
He 'd set walls between us .
After a while , I 'd seen a picture on his facebook page .
It was an angagement ring !
The congratulations words below the picture was explaining everything : He've got married to someone else !
I could n't believe my eyes !
How come he 'd done that to me !
What happened all those words he 'd given to me !
Asking him was useless .
All the answer I could take was a huge silence ...
I managed to keep calm though there was thunder inside my heart .
But I could n't speak anyway .
Just looked her with asking eyes .
" He 's died . " she said as if she was whispering .
Her voice was weak and shaky .
" I 'd found this in his office . "
Then handed me a box and walked away .
Nothing more ...
Now , after all those long years have gone by with full of pain , disappointments , missing and regrets ; all I have was the memories which saved by him into a little wooden box .
I 've never got the reason made him leave me although all his love for me , unfortunately ...
People argue that today 's television is a load of rubbish , the quality of many programs is absolutely questionable and in many cases the language is vulgar .
Reasons why television has inherited this reputation are several .
First of all , the many repeats of all programs like serials or films do not motivate people to watch it .
Then , the large number of entertainment programs broadcasted discourage those who want more cultural or factual programs , as they have been drastically reduced .
It seems a result of the fact that , after a long day , people prefer to unwind in front of the television , watching " entertainment programs " rather then news or what 's up in the World .
Moreover , on television there are a lot of advertising constantly interrupting the broadcast , and of course this fact is very unpleasant .
Despite all these facts , it is without doubt that television has changed our lives .
There are also positive things that we have to take into consideration before to condemn it .
For example , the wider choose of programs from all over the World , allow us to discover new cultures , new languages and new societies without travelling , and this enhance our knowledge .
In addition to that , the cost of the television as an entertainment form compared to the cinema , the theatre or Opera is cheaper and affordable by everyone .
Also , it is very important to remember that we have always the possibility to choose what we want to watch and when .
To sum - up , I think television is a very good value for money , the point is being able to choose what we want to watch .
Famous people are exposed to criticism and public opinion , but what does it mean ?
Firstly , there are two kinds of famous people : those who want to have a private life and who do n't want everybody knowing each aspect of their lives and those who sell certain parts of their lives in magazines , journals or TV programmes or their entire private life .
Secondly , taking this into account , I think that everybody has the right of having a private life and the right of living without journalists following them to everywhere .
It 's true that their lives are too much exposed and they can not have a normal life .
Of course , they can control that by complaining in a trial .
Thirdly , in my opinion they have the right also of selling only the parts of their lives they want .
But in contrast , there is the problem of when they should stop , and journalists continue selling information or pictures and it could arrive an embarrassing moment and if you have sold a kind of things like this before you ca n't say nothing .
To summarize , I believe that everybody deserve to have a private life .
When it does n't occur , they have to go to trials .
Dear Jo ,
It is absolutely rewarding to receive good news from an old friend who has been absent of my life for so long time .
I would be completely happy to provide you with some accommodation while you stay in my country .
I am currently working at a place where I am getting a great wage so I have the possibility to accompany you on your journey .
We might go to the most representative places of Mexico such as : Templo mayor , Cancún , Acapulco , among many others .
In mexico , a foreign person do not face difficulties to be hired by a company . I would be pleased to help you with this part of your experience in my contry . I know that you are someone who loves animals ,
perhaps we can go to the city zoo in order to verify wheter there are any vacancies that fit with you .
Something I can do is to make some research about the places that need people who speak Englsih fluently .
As you know , in this country if you are someone who speaks more than 1 language , you have the chances to obtain a great job .
Please let me know if you need something extra while you are here .
Maybe a special diet , special clothes or any kind of thing you might need that will not be easy to find here .
Best regards ,
Luis
I played wrestling at the College .
This was during my first year at the College .
This sport is performed in a group of twos .
It is performed one after the other according to their age groups .
Wrestling is new sport , which is unknown to many of my colleagues at the College .
It is played by both boys and girls .
Wrestling is performed during the night time when the moon light is on .
Wrestling is contested by two people while others wait for their turns respectively .
It starts with a drumming and singing by young girls of the community .
This were all the beautiful girl are shown to the young men of the community .
It is another method of admiring girls .
Wrestling is both interesting and entertaining sport .
Traditionally , we provide a firewood as a means of light at night for the sport .
It takes place in the middle of the village where there are enough space for the spectators .
Before the contest starts .
Referee advise players about the rules of the game .
As such , referee explains the rules of the game through their captains i.e. Health and Safety .
The game starts with dancing and singing .
Refreshments are on sale at a discounted price to visiting team .
This is a sport performed by young people only .
The rationale for the College are : to educate the student about our culture , ritual , values and out ways of life in the village .
First of all I lived in London for three weeks in 2012 .
I am a teacher in a High School and the authorities in my country let me stay there , improving my English .
I would like to say that learning any languages is complicated to someone , whatever you come from , but in my opinion there are many matter to discuss .
A good ilustration of this would be children .
One child whose parents come from different countries is able to learn two languages at the same time , this child does n't need to go abroad to learn a foreign language , but they are listening to their parents speaking English their native language all the time and this let them learn without any difficulty .
On the other hand , if you go abroad you will be able to improve your English in anglophone country , in this case , your knowledge will be reinforced with your stay there .
To sum up , if you want to learn English you do n't need to go abroad , you can improve your English working hard inside your own country , for example , doing exercises like listening and writing or you can meet with native people who speak English to practise with them .
But if you have one opportunity to go abroad , this would be so good for you and your English .
After my graduation , I was employed by AECOM Asia Ltd Co. as a graduate engineer since September 2013 .
I was assigned to work on project of the CLP Power Hong Kong Ltd under agreement of Term Geotechnical Consultancies .
I assisted the project engineer in Engineer Inspection for Maintenance .
Regular maintenance is essential for all man - made slopes to avoid deterioration .
We are working on those slopes near power station or pylon .
The maintenance responsibility of those slopes belongs to the CLP Power Hong Kong Ltd.
Before inspection , I need to take the course which is conducted by CLPP for the access permit .
The course is mainly on workplace safety within power station .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
my name is Eleonora Palerma , I am 17 years old and I live in a city in northern Italy called Seregno .
I am writing to apply for the job of summer camp assistant which I saw advertised in the " Daily mail " .
Apart from studying at the high school " Marie Curie " of Meda , I sing in a choir as a soprano and my director would be pleased to speak for me if you would like to contact him to get further information .
I am keen on sports , especially volleyball , which I started playing at an early age , and I suppose I would be able to teach them how to play it and to organise a tournament .
I think I would be a suitable candidate for the job because I am used to looking after my neighbours ' children and I have recently attended a course about first aid so I would be ready to medicate children in case they get injured .
In addition to my native language I can speak German as well as English in fact I am attending a first certificate course now and last year I spent 2 months in Berlin , my german teacher would be happy to receive your call to tell you more about my language experiences .
If it is necessary I would be willing to come for an interview at any time .
I hope you will consider my application .
Yours faithfully ,
Eleonora Palerma

In my opinion , the home of the future wo n't change much .
It still has to have the same elements like : roof , walls , floor , ceiling , basement , loft , door or windows .
Construction will be ameliorated .
However a sweeping appearance wo n't be different .
Although , I think , that all the systems , which work in homes ( electricity , gas , heating system , water , etc . ) will be upgraded .
New technologies are going to seize architecture .
Though , it will affect on the environment in a good way .
I think , that the home of the future will be huge , but single - storey .
For one thing - convenience .
Nobody likes stairs and lifts .
The next thing is big windows .
It is the most important element in the home of the future .
Huge , bulletproof windows are my biggest dream . I could n't live without them .
Except that , every room will be full of interactive gadgets .
Owing to that people wo n't need to meet and talk .

Dear students ,
Welcome in the city of Hasselt .
I wish you a wonderful time in my hometown .
Hasselt offers a wide range of interesting activities and has a lot of places of interest .
What you really can not miss is the big shopping street .
Hasselt is famous for its great shopping accommodation .
You will find all different types of shops .
Hasselt has it all , from museums and shops with the latest fashion , to shops with local products such as gingerbread and gin .
If you are getting tired from wandering through all the streets and alleys , you can always go and have a pleasant drink in one of the many little cafés at the market square .
In the evening , when all the daytrippers are gone , the city wakes up again and all the bars reopen .
You should really have a taste of Hasselt 's dazzling nightlife .
Kind regards , Wouter .
THE MOST INTERESTING WEEKEND ON MY LIFE
I had always believed that the best memories of life were when you meet new people , new places , going out with your friends , taking sun on the beach , thingS like this .
Are beautiful moments , but now I reckon that there is n't nothing more interesting than having all your family together talking about whole background .
Surprising stories that we will not never imagine .
My family are n't so close and is distributed in many cities on my country , after some incidents in the past , many things changed and each family followed their own way .
However , my siblings and I decided to set up a big surprise to my father for his birthday number 50 .
We tried to contat the most amount famiy as we could .
It was a perfect weekend because there was a holiday on Monday .
We rented a wonderful place outside our city , spectacular atmosphere .
It was the most interesting and astonishing weekend that I have lived eve .
Firstly , to see father 's face when he saw all people .
A long time I haven't seen my father so happy . secondly , seeing how big is the family now , many children .
Everything was amazing , a lot of memories , we laughed a lot , we did many activities like bbq , table games , watched movies , swimming pool , among others .
Now I believe that the best moments in the life are when you have time with your family , is the best way to recharge energy for everything .
Many times we pay more attention to other things , it can do it in many opportunities .
Family is one , and we do n't know when can lose them .
In my opinion travelling by car is more comfortable than travelling by public transport because you can choose where do you want to go and the time you prefer to start your trip .
Travelling around the city by car was faster than public transport .
If I won the lottery , I would buy an electric car because you can you park in the center of the town .
And when you want to move around your city , if you go by car , most of the time you ca n't park your car because there are very few car parks in the cities .
Sometimes public transport is interesting because you can use it when you want to go to a party and you probably drink some wine , beer , etc .
If you would like to go fast to somewhere , do n't use public transport because it is very slow .
The problem to use our car instead of public transport is the pollution .
If everyone use public transport climate change does not increase more .
Hi Conie ,
How are you ?
I 've seen your letter and I 'm writing this to you to say what I do in my country to help saving the environment .
At my school I do n't do that much because we are just five people that are worried about the world .
We tried to convince the Headmaster to help us monetarily but it was n't enough .
At home I convinced my family to recycle and reuse the water that we ca n't drink , to give to our plants .
Now what do you do at your school and at your home ?
Tell me I 'm curious .
See you
Francisco
Indroduction
The aim of this report is to outline what are the best places to have fun in Valencia for young people , what facilities exist for them and how these could be made better .
Activities around the city
My city , Valencia , is a touristic city situaded by the sea .
Young people can enjoy going to the cinema in the city center after having some " tapas " and some drinks .
Also , it would be a good idea go to the beach to spend the day and play volleyball or sunbathing , because this it is always a good plan .
Valencia , has different areas to go out in the evening , but some of them required the passport , so if you are younger than 18 it would be difficult to enter .
Moreover , you can go to eat " Paella " and ride around the " Albufera " of Valencia in a small boat .
However , the art and science museum , it could be the funniest plan .
Other activities in the surroundings .
In addition i suggested going by bus around the surroundings of the city , where you can do adventure sports , like canoening , climbing or just walking around the mountains and enjoy the countryside
Recommendations
I recommend that they should do both activities , Valencia city and also de the surroundings .
Maybe I could check if I can bring you some free tickets for the public transport .
It would be great !
My family aand I like to watch movies all the time .
We are always go to the cinema to watch a new one .
My favourite kinds of movie is comedy and drama comedy because it has interesting plot and person , who watches comedy can lought all the time .
While person is watching this kind of movie he / she is just relaxing and has a good time .
Now I will further developed our last statement .
As Lloyd Cohen ( the Director of the Worldwide Market Analysis ) said lottery play is not economically irrational and uninformed .
He presents a theory in which buying lottery tickets is not a misguided input into wealth production as some critics believe , but a valuable input into creating a sense of possibilty from scaping from one 's current life by acquiring wealth .
It is certainly true that people who play are almost certain to lose money .
Cohen 's knwoledge is that playing the lottery is not automatically irrational .
Some people like to calculated the gain or lose from buying the lottery but other people that can afford a dolar ticket now prefer to keep their dreams .
People do n't invest the money they spend on lottery .
They spend it and get those dreams in return .
Though this has been an amusing debate , we the affirmative side , on the weight of our argument and proof , have concluded that lottery should n't be banned in the US and Spain , because it is a tradition , it gives help , hope and support to public entities and it must be a rational investment .
Hello dear Ben ,
I received your letter yesterday .
Sorry for my late answer .
I hope my suggestions will help you .
Our city has only one airport .
First of all you should find the entrance of the airport .
Then you should know that you there will be two kinds of transport .
Taxy is the first variant .
It 's the quickest way to come to my home but at the same time it 's more expensive .
Also you can use the bus .
You should write me the exact time of your plane arrival .
Then I 'll write back the timetable of bus arrivals .
It might be more boring way to my home but I like it for the price .
When you hear the bus stop Ploshad Truda you should leave the bus and I 'll meet you at this bus stop .
In my opinion the weather is better today than yesterday .
But it has been raining for four days .
So it would be very well if you take a warm coat and an umbrella .
Hoping to see you soon ,
your friend , Semyon .
Report :
The swimming pool in Brunete has customers from all age groups , but it is especially suitable both for young and elderly people in order to improve their mobility .
The building has two changing rooms for men and women .
Several bathrooms are available with cold and hot water in them and a 25 metre - length heated pool .
As far as I am concerned there are some pros and cons about the use of the swimming pool .
On the one hand everything is very cleaned including floor , bath and corridors , in addition , if you are a disabled person you will not have any trouble to get there because there are some ramps to help you come in .
On the other hand you will have to pay 45 euros a month to use facilities , and besides , you will not be able to do exercises because there is not any gym inside the building .
In my opinion the swimming pool is convenient because you can walk to swim if you live in town but is very expensive , particularly for young people .
I suggest that prices should be lower than they actually are .
Famous people have been always sorrunded by a lot of journalists and paparazzies who follow them wherever they go .
Those people could be politicians , film starts , singers , football players and so on living in a constant stress because they can not have a " normal " life , and , from my point of view , that 's normal because they live for this , they are public people and because of this they have to keep calm and carry with it .
Therefore , most of this famous people complain of this but it is logical that all the media , television , radio and journalists are constanlty devoting every minute of the day to them because people are interested in them , in knowing what they are doing every second , in knowing with whom they are , in knowing what they like or do n't like , their hobbies , in short , in knowing everything about them .
In conclusion , being famous is really difficult and frustrating as well , but in contrast , they earn a lot of money and they are loved by so many people though they have to accept some critics because not everybody has to love them .
I do agree with a statement that shopping is not always enjoyable .
When we need to buy something , we mostly choose shopping centres .
It has many disadvantages .
It 's a large space with a lot of shops , so we need much time to visit all of them .
After a few hours we are so tired , that we do not have power to do anything else .
Besides , in the shopping centres there 's a loud energetic music played all the time and a crowd of people , so we get home with a huge headache .
Money is another reason why we do not always enjoy the shopping .
We live in a time of acquisitiveness and people buy many things , even if they ca n't afford it .
Of course , people usually do not need all of those things .
This behaviour causes a moral hangover and a spiral of credit .
Times in which we live are conducive to addictions .
People addicted to shopping in the long run do not enjoy this ritual anymore - they do it just because they have to , although they have no money and no space at home for all those things they buy .
I think we should learn to buy only things we really need and we can afford .
Sometimes better is to visit some small shops than big centres .
This should help us enjoy shopping .
Public transport is the future .
Today in big cities public transport is necessary for tourists , students , kids and workers ; but the situation is very different in small cities .
In Italy there are few cities with the hunderground and often in the smaller cities there are only bus .
A good public transport is the sign of a civilized city . in this way there are fewer cars so less traffic .
Public transport also reduces the cars ' pollution and saves fuel .
I hope for the next generations a better public service and an increasement of its use .
thanks to this new life stryle our cities will be more liveable .

Hello Mark !
Sorry for my late reply .
You should n't spend so much time watching television because it is n't healthy .
Actually , I do n't watch much television , because I do n't have much free time , but if I had it , I think I would watch more .
Now , that I 'm on holidays , I watch more tv , especially some series like : Criminal Investigation or The Mentalist .
They are really good !
To relax , I used to read , listen to music , go to the cinema , hang out with friends , go shopping , ride a bike or swim .
What do you do to relax , beside watching TV ?
Hope to hear from you soon ,
Inês .
The reasons for Greece 's terrible economic situation are that Greece has surrender its currency sovereignty to the European Central Bank , by which Greece could not apply monetary policy to spur its economy , and the Greek government is very corrupted so that Greeks could easily dodge taxes .
In contrast , in Taiwan , we have our own currency and the government is efficient and well - organized .
Clearly , Taiwan will not be the next Greece .
Monetary policy could be a very useful short term financial tool for a government to stimulate its worsening economy , and , from the empirical experience , many countries have successful applied such policy .
In 2012 , Japanese central bank unprecedented depreciated Yuan , which has obviously improved its exports and recovered its economy from stagnation .
Obviously , Taiwan has its own currency , new Taiwan dollar , and if Taiwan 's economy is worsening someday , Taiwanese government could simply mimic what Japanese government did in 2012 .
Not only Taiwan is different from Greece in currency sovereignty , it also wins in government 's efficiency .
According to a global survey , Taiwan wins reputation in effectiveness , in which Taiwan government has legislated severe laws to prevent corruption .
Therefore , Taiwanese have to pay taxes by regulation and do not dare to evade taxes .
Without a doubt , the efficacy of Taiwanese government is beneficial to people 's welfare .
All in all , Taiwan has currency sovereignty and is well - known for its effectiveness .
Therefore , Taiwan would not be sunk down like Greece .
As a country , Taiwan has to stick to its ordinary path to create lovely and healthy environment to its civilians .
Once upon a time a mason called Nick that had a family of four , two sons and his wife but they had conflicts with the studies of their children , the money he earned was not enough to maintain the whole family they were in poverty .
His kids dreamed with a big house that has a pool , a third floor , Jacuzzi and a beautiful landscape to the beach , also they wanted to have a dog , if they had one it would be called Winy .
They told every dream to their dad , and they know he would enforce it even though under the circumstances it seemed to be impossible he would try .
Next week a cousin that he did not know , he was a very reach man and when he knew about their problem he decided to help so he gave them an incentive .
He said that if Nick makes a house of two floors he would buy it and pay the studies of the children lifelong , which gave a reverse to the impossible
Nick started making the planes for the house , from that moment he trended to get to his house and at the moment drag the planes and continue working when he finished the planes after months of working on them he started to bring it to life , the house would be made of wood because he could not pay for more .
After months of working in the house he finished , and his cousin gave him a bonus reward of one million dollars to start with , buying a big house with everything they want .
The kids started going to a private school .
When they got eighteen they could get a good job because of their good studies .
They could give a good life to their families and have a dog also called Winy , and all this thanks to the rich man that nobody knew .
The pie chart shows the principal causes which justify why agricultural lands became less productive , whereas the table correlates these causes with three different regions of the world which had land degraded , namely North America , Europe and Oceania , during the 1990s .
Overall , it is clear that the main causes for land degredation were deforestation and over - grazing .
These causes also had a negative impact on two regions that were analysed , in Europe and Oceania , and , consequently , these areas had higher rates in terms of total land degreaded .
A closer look at the pie chart reveals that over - grazing was the most important reason why land was so degraded , with the highest percentage of 35% .
This was followed by the deforestation , with 30% , while over - cultivation had 28% .
Finally , 7% could be explained for other reasons .
It may be justified by the fact that there was an excess of chemicals in the agricultural activity .
This also needs to be compared to the table .
Not surprisingly , these causes played an important role when we talk about the percentage of land which was affected by these causes , particularly in Europe and Oceania .
In the first case , Europe reprented the highest percentage of land degraded caused by deforestation and over - cultivation , 9.8% and 7.7% respectively .
This was a great impact on total land degraded as Europe was more affected , with a total of 23% .
By another side , Oceania had the highest land degraded rate at 11.3% bacause of over - grazing , which also contributed to having 13% of land degraded .
By contrast , in general North America had the lowest rates in deforestation and over - grazing , with 0.2% and 1.5% respectively .
for this resaon , this region presented the lowest percentage of land degraded , with only 5% .
There are many famous buildings in Guangzhou .
One of them is Canton Tower .
If you travel to Guangzhou , you ca n't miss this series because this is a symbol of Guangzhou .
Canton Tower is located at an intersection of Guangzhou New city Central Axes and Pearl River .
It is the highest tower in China and the third highest tower in the world .
The height of the tower is 600 metres , with 450 metres main body and 150 metres of its antenna .
The tower has a special name called ' slim waist ' because the shape of it is twisting .
We can see different picture of the tower from different angles .
This is not only a sightseeing building , but also has a lot of recessional facilities .
For example , the tower has 4D cinema , the highest revolving restaurant and so on .
Cantonese always spend their holiday with their child here .
Do you want to go to have a look after reading my introduction ?
Trust me , you will not regret it .
ARE YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS YOUR BEST FRIENDS ?
Firstly , I must say that I do n't consider that my family members are my best friends , not only because they have other problems to care about but also because I do n't know how to tell them my problems .
However , we consider a friend that person you can have fun with , laugh and meet . I 'm use to do that with my parents and my brothers but it 's not the same as when I meet my best friends .
Moreover , I think that I should n't ask them to have what we call a " therapy moment " as I do with my best friends when I 'm worried for something or someone , in fact I would n't know how to start telling them about that .
Some teenagers have the luck to be open - minded and they know how to speak with their parents and it 's a good way to solve problems .
In my opinion I think that I should have more confidence with my family and remember that they wo n't leave me for something I had done in other way my best friends can do .
In my town , there is no future for public transport , because the time necessary to get to the city centre is the same walking or by bus .
Travel by bus is expensive , bored and annoying .
The route makes many stops , in different places , so the way in the map is a mess .
This is like that all days , except Sunday .
On Sunday , the bus do n't work until 3 p.m.
From this hour , there is only one service every hour , until 10 p.m. Anyone of these 7 bus takes less a half hour to get to the city centre , in spite of Sunday has not traffic jam .
Buses are slow and noisy , and when you can get off of them , you are tired and angry , and probably you are not on time .
Is much more convenient you walk to the city centre .
The town is not a big city , so the air is not very dirty .
At the same time , you can get fit walking approximately 30 or 40 minutes , and you will not have the problem for park your car .
You will expend the same time travelling by bus or walking , but the difference is to get angry or not .
Transportation is a means of movement of one geographical location to another by any means of transport .
We have different means of transport .
They are transport by land , by air , by sea and by train .
We know in the olden days how our forefathers suffered in their movement .
If a person wants to trevel from Kano to Lagos he has no choice but to track .
Therefore , is not easy back there for anybody to use other means because there was non .
At present there are many means of transportation .
The technology brought about lots of development in transportation .
We can travel by air using the aircraft , aeroplane , helcopter and rest .
Unlike before we have big ships to use on the sea .
The train is also a very useful means of transportation and very economical .
I believed that technology really improve our ways and means of our transport .
So whoever want to star a journey has several choice of transport , eaither by sea , by air , by land or by foot .
I can not forget to talk about cars , lorry and vehicles .
They are very useful and speedy .
Thanks
Just like a fish in the water
Swimming is my favourite sport in the world , I started it when I was five years old , I really enjoy it , I feel that the water is my place in the word , I feel free .
Although I took part in many competitions , there are one which was the most enjoyable experience in my life .
I have to swimming in the Parana 's river with all the swimmers and coaches .
First , when I was in the starting line I felt could not finish the competition , then when we were in the water the coaches did not stop to encourage so was easy to swim to the finishing line . I was so exciting to see our family waiting for us clapping and shouting loudly every time one of us arrived .
If you are interested in taking part in this sport , I would suggested to buy all the equipment you will need : a comfortable swimsuit , goggles and a huge bag to keep them .
Status : Popular
' The moment of realisation hits you like tons of bricks , leaving you in a life full of regret and guilt '
His whole life , he only wished for one thing and that was to be popular .
Her name was Sara .
Michael had always seen her in the hallways , smiling and laughing .
Anywhere she went , she was always surrounded by a handful of students .
People got attracted towards her quite easily and often , they would find themselves adoring and admiring her .
Although she was n't pretty , she had an aura of importance .
Her presence was felt .
She was popular but not proud , and that made her even more likable by all .
All but one - Michael .
Whenever , he saw her , he felt pain .
Pain of jealousy .
A fire of hatred burnt his heart whenever he heard her gleeful laughter .
All his life , he had only wished to be popular but his dream of popularity had been long ago snatched by a girl .
That girl , who had once been his best friend .
That girl who had left him in need of time .
That girl who had done nothing but harm for him .
She was Sara .
His long lost best friend Sara .
That night had changed their lives .
Both of their lives .
In every way , in every form .
An innocent dare made by Sara which led Michael to walk in a path of wrong .
A dare to prove .
courage can change lives
He was isolated .
Abandoned by his friends .
All was a façade .
They had all worn masks .
Everyone , even his own Sara .
He had been wrong .
All along he was wrong .
They had n't isolated him , rather he had .
They had n't abandoned him neither had they distanced themselves from him .
He had distanced himself from them .
His Sara was there , all along she was there for him .
In the first place , she never left him .
She had always wanted to be with him but he had closed the door for her .
Yet , she waited , hoping he would realise she would always be there for him .
Tears were streaming down his face . Stinging his eyes .
He deserved it .
Every bit of pain .
He had been blind by rage .
All these years .
His selfishness stood in the way .
His delusions had drifted him away from her .
He had done such a huge mistake .
No tears or sorrys would make a less culprit .
No one should forgive him for what he did .
No one .
Right now , he has the one thing he always wished for - popularity , but only now does he realise , that it was meaningless , point less .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Each and every colour glow in the dark giving hope out of the darkness .
In this essay , I am going to discuss whether building a bypass around our town is beneficial to our community or not .
One of the advantages pointed out by local politicians in the meeting was that this bypass would lower the rate of air pollution around town , which I highly agree with because the extra traffic caused due to the passing cars added to the vehicles used by the locals cause massive smog in the atmosphere , not to mention being terribly bad to the health of the walking , cycling citizens , especially young children , babies .
Another important point is that this bypass would improve the traffic in the town center .
Mostly during 7 to 8 am and 3 to 4 pm , when people go and finish work , that is when we get the most awful traffic jams , sometimes it takes an hour to get form point A to B in town which is a terribly long time not to mention parents who have to take their children to school , nursery and then get to work , too .
On the other hand the bypass might cause a drastic drop in tourism in the town .
However , it is also true to say that people who are actually interested in historical sites would visit the town anyway .
All in all , I would say the bypass would be more of a disadvantage than advantage , because it would cut us off from people and the town would receive less funding if it 's less important .
Local politicians should focus on sustainability , using vehicles which do not harm the environment .
On the 4th of April I met a group called Emblem3 .
Because I did n't find any ticket for the concert in London I bought one for the concert in Birmingham .
I 've booked the ticket nearly one month before the event .
The day before I started to freak out thinking that I was meeting them .
Else the ticket for the concert I bought the VIP ticket as well , so I had to go before to Birmingham , because the entrance to the venue was at 17:00 and as I live close to London , I had to leave at about 12:00 so I did n't have to rush .
I got to Birmingham at 14:00 , I think , and then , as I 've never been to Birmingham I had to look for the 02 Academy , where the event took place .
When I arrived there , I queued for the VIP queue .
At 17:00 they let us in the venue and they made all the checkings .
After 30 minutes started the acoustic performance which lasted for about 15 minutes , afterwards we took pictures .
When everybody took their photos , Emblem3 got backstage to get ready for the concert and after one hour it sterted .
I left the arena at midnight and I went to an hotel that I did already book online .
On the day after I went back home .
It was the best day of my life .

You also mentioned that I would need to work in the kitchens helping .
I could also add that I know how to cook for lots of people .
For all the reasons I mentioned before , I think I am the right person for this job .
I look forward to receiving your answer .
Yours Faithfully ,
Maria
It 's true that commuting to work is n't as convenient as going to work by car .
That 's the reason why more people prefer to spend more time stuck in traffic listening to songs instead of waiting a long time to take a bus which is usually crowded .
On top of that , taking a bus wo n't necessarily mean that you will save time because both buses and cars wo n't be able to move in the rush hour .
Besides , a car gives you more freedom and flexibility to make your own schedule while public transport limits you to a timetable that not always meet your needs .
After cars prevailed among the public , our governments have tried to pave rough roads , which promotes people to use cars even more .
Nowadays , it might be argued if the current transportation system would be working in the future like present , while there is a still big room for public transportation remaining as a significant method .
This essay will offer a couple of points about whether public transportation will still be around us or if it will disappear completely .
For a start , the convenience for us to travel around would probably be one of the main arguments .
In some countries , the amount of transportation such as train is not sufficient , which forces people to use private cars .
However , it is also true that there are always minors who have no choice but to take public transport and also for their parents it is definitely more reliable .
What is also important is the impact on the environment , which is already considerably damaged by human technology .
If a car which emits no serious global warming gas would be developed , there would be no argument that people had better reduce our use of cars , yet , as long as we are manufacturing them we could not find more eco - friendly and efficient ways than public transportation .
In conclusion , it is my belief that it is not possible for public transport to disappear in the future even though travelling with cars is more convenient than travelling with just trains or buses .
But in the same way as cars development , our governments might have to make some progress on public transport to encourage citizens to be more eco - friendly .
All of the world is constantly changing - develop a new technologies , people invented new think .
But why ?
To make life easier . People always want to make better their life .
Why not ?
I think that the home of the future will be different than now , but the main function of the home wo n't change , because for ages home have been a place where people can feel safely .
Everybody think that home is refuge .
In my opinion home in the future will be similar to present houses .
There always will be the kitchen , because we must eat , always will be the bathroom - you know why .
And in the home always will be a room to sleep and relax .
Home in the future may be more modern and safety .
Everywhere will be cameras and motion sensors .
Kitchen will be better eguipped , may be with smart appliances and people , who ca n't cook , will prepare the meal by yourself .
May be in the future homes will be self - cleaned and we need not clean up .
I think that the differences between home now and home in the future will be small .
Personally houses in the future will not be cosy , but very sterile . I do not like it .
Home should associate with family , happiness .
Not with cold and spacious rooms .
I think the statement is somewhat true .
Travelling by car is getting more convenient .
Traffic accidents , the main problem of car travelling , will be solved by self - driving technology .
Although driving by car is less safe than using public transport at present , driving will be safe .
However , there is also a problem .
Having a car takes much money .
Using public transport is cheaper than having a car , especially living in urban area .
The second problem may be solved by car - sharing .
If one wants to go somewhere , one can use a shared car which is parked at designated area .
By this method , people have to pay small fee for use a car , not much money such as having a car .
If car - sharing and self - driving technology are mixed , it will be much more convenient than both the conventional public transport and travelling my car .
People can go anywhere they want to go from anywhere .
People do n't have to possess their car paying much money .
It will be a new public transport .
All my life I practiced sports , but definitely my favorite sport is squash .
I started to training when I was ten years old .
I had never played a raquet 's sport before , so I was very excited to hit the small black ball with my racket .
Three times a week I played , then I went more often .
The first year I went to a tournament in Torreon and I win the first place , during the first 3 years I was ranking in the first 10 places of Mexico , but then I had to reduce my practices because I had a problem with my knees .
Play squash is an awesome activity and is easy to learn , I love that this game is very fast and you do a lot of exercise .
The bad news is that in Mexico is not very common , so it 's a little bit difficult to find a field and is expensive , more or less the price per hour is $ 150 pesos .
For someone new in this sport I would recommended be patient and constant in the training , because the practice is what make you better and helps to improve your level , and finally always enjoy the game .
Always been free .
Never had any serious relationship .
The longest was at the primary school , lasted 2 days , because her mother could cook the finest biscuits ever tasted .
Now he was 35 and he was still keeping on smile at the news of his colleagues and friends marriages .
He was so cynical to turn out to be very nasty and unpopolar .
Love last two and a half a year , he kep to remind himself .
Soon or later mariied people will get divorced .
Look at me , he said , I 'm free .
No one is happier than me .
Since one day he met a girl , on the train , she was n't that beauty but she had , you know , that smile , so peaceful , so harmonic .
It was love at first sight .
They started talking blaming for the train late and after two hours they were still chatting .
They laughed so much that they both forgot to get out at the right stop .
The poor two had gone too far and now they had to come back .
It was n't a problem .
They had a lot of fun .
Finally he arrived .
He said hello to the girl smiling .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Nowadays everybody has one or more cars , as a consequence of that , some people believe that public transport is going to disappear .
There are several reasons to believe that ; firstly , many people are influenced by the advertising which mixes happiness with driving cars and makes people think that public transport is not as a smart option as cars .
In second place , it is not enjoyable to wait for the bus or the underground .
On the other hand , there are a number of reasons against the end of the public transport .
For example , you must take public transport instead the car because it produces less pollution .
In addition , public transport is cheap because to buy a car meaning spend a fortune and in big cities , where are concerned about the environment such as Amsterdam or Tokio , there are many facilities as mobile phone applications or special offers .
To sum up , no one knows the future ; however , I believe that travelling on public transport is as convenient as by car or more because it is good to save up money and to reduce contamination .
" There is no future for public transport because travelling by car is so much more convenient "
In my opinion less people are travelling by public transport and started to buy their own cars which is more comfortable to use whenever you are in a hurry or not .
In the first place you feel more comfortable in your own car than in a bus for example . You do n't need fear that someone could suddenly stole your purse or you do n't have to listen to the others when you travel by your car .
Studies have shown that your self esteem and feelings of protection increase when you are a car driver .
You do n't have to indulge staying in a crowded place with people you do n't know .
Saving some money and buy a car is the best thing you can do .
In the second place not all public transports are in their best shape .
Some of them are dirty and smell .
If you have your own car these things do n't bother you anymore cause you wash your car anytime you want .
In conclusion travelling by car is far better than using public transport

Dear Paul !
Thanks for your e - mail and photos !
They are amazing !
I 'm very glad you enjoyed your holidays .
Spain must be really incredible !
I 'm writing to you to tell you about the U2 concert , which took place in " Spodek " arena in Katowice last month .
I must admit that this is my favourite band .
I 've always wanted to see them live and finally my dreams came true .
The best of it was that I saw them really close , because of my dad 's work .
As you know , he works in security company , called Solid Safety and he was appointed to be a bodyguard to even Bono !
Could you imagine my reaction , when he told me about it .
Of course , then he handed in two " Staff " tickets to me .
These tickets allow you to get in to the VIP zone .
I invited my classmate Sally and we went on a concert together .
We were so excited , when we got on .
Before the show we were helping in placing a sounding equipment .
During the concert we were standing on the backstage .
Where could be better ? !
After the last song my dad took us to the Bono 's room .
He was signing autographs and chatting with fans .
I will never forget it .
My dad took even a photo of us with him .
I must say , he is much more handsome in live that on the TV .
That 's all for now , but I will write more , when I find my feet ! I will appreciate my dad 's work forever .
Give my regards to your parents !
Love , Lisa
Hello ,
I 'm sending this Email to get some information because I 'm interested in studying at your university .

I 've graduated in 2010 majoring in accounting with a degree having an accumulated GPA of 2.49 out of 5 , since I came here I have been so ambitious that I will be getting my high studies as soon as I finish studying English , it turned out that I have to jump through the loop in order to over come these obstacles which I believe it is an ordinary requirements to get a master 's degree for the foreign students .
In addition , there is recent statistic that shows a very high percentage of Saudi Arabia students who came to America to do set their master 's degree that they could n't get in university due to some requirements for instance , GRE , G MAT , or even their GPA did n't meet the university conditions .
In fact , I do n't want to be one of those student who could n't accomplish their dream and go back to their home , I 'm willing to do whatever it takes to get into your university .
I would like to have the orientation material to increase my chances of getting into university and I will do me best to get very high grades in order to increase my GPA when it 's added to my transcript , to sum up what I 'm looking for is to take a preparation class in business to be included in the final accumulated GPA .
Finally , I believe that it it a great opportunity to study in the United States and to improve my education and my lifestyle .
Besides , I 'm an eager , mature student willing to study master 's degree at your university and I 'm looking forward to getting response back and your recommendations .
sincerely ,
I am forty nine years old and I am a quite crazy , so I make a lot of mistakes .
In this writing I will comment about one of the last mistake that I have made and its consequent .
First , I want to focus your attention on the fact that normally the mistakes have not importance , because all the things have fix and , if they have not fix why do you worry ?
In the last trip , I parked my car on the airport park , it has many plants with several sign .
Every plant has a color sign , red , orange , green , blue and an intermediate color between the red and the orange and this was my confusion .
I left my car in the plant with the orange color , but when some day later I looked for my car I made it in the plant of the intermediate color .
I knew that my car was on the site number one hundred and thirty five , buy the car was not there .
I spend quite time thinking and when I decided go to the police I passed in front of the orange sign and finally I found my car .
Dear Thomas
How are you ?
I 'm nervous to see you .
The weather here is sunny so I recommend you to bring summer clothes It is sad that you only come for one week but we will enjoy a lot .
From the airport to my house there are just 5 minutes .
When you came out to the road you need to go straight until you reach a restaurant , then you must go to the left where you would find a big square with swings and slides .
Finally you would see a big red house with lots of windows .
You will no regret coming to Spain .
See you soon .
Recently , studying online has become a very popular alternative way to study .
Although it provides students with lots of advantages , not everything is as good as it sounds .
First of all , studying online does not allow students to ask teachers about questions .
How can they solve their problems if there is a lack of student - teacher interaction ?
What is more , this kind of students are between eighteen and twenty two , when they need to socialise and interact with other students to enjoy their free time .
Something impossible if they study online , which means that their only classmate is the computer or the laptop they use .
However , this method of studying is cheaper than the common way , and it also can be completely free which is a big advantage .
Moreover , it allows you to study with your own rhythm without thinking about the rest .
For these reasons , I prefer the common way than studying online .
Nevertheless , I can understand people who choose the second option .
It is up to you !
No Future for public transport :
Nowadays people want to travel by their own conveyance by their own car , bike , scooter or something like that .
Everyone wants to have a stress less / happy journey whether it is for a long route or not .
It is really realistic too , because we all want to save our time and wishes for a happy journey time .
Now let me tell you the scenario of public transport .
First of all we always need to wait for it and it will run according to the scheduled time only .
In winter it is fine we can adjust in crowd but if we talk about summer session we can not adjust when we are travelling in a suffocated environment .
We need to book tickets in advance , in case we are planning to go via public transport because again the issue of availability of seats are there .
I live in Trieste , a very beautiful city , but this city has a great problem : it has a lot of cars , more than inhabitants .
Of course it 's an exaggeration , but I say this to confirm that in this city the number of the cars is very high .
By the way , the public transport is not so convenient , because at a certain hours you can not find bus .
In our city the buses stop at midnight .
Also the ticket price is not cheap .
Another problem of the buses is that if you take one during certain hours , it 's impossible to find a place free to sit down .
So travelling by bus is not convenient , not only for time but also for the problems that you can find .
The other question is that Trieste is situated near Slovenia , where , the price of petrol is cheaper than in Italy , so a great number of inhabitants of our city prefer to fuel the car directly in Slovenia , where they can find much more competitive prices .
My father lives in Pordenone and he sells cars .
He wants to convince me to use alternative means of transport , but after I see the price of this ecological vehicle I considered that I 'll buy one of them only if the price becomes
loverer .
Currently , people think about if they can get good english in my country or have to move to english speaking country .
And after that , it depends on the personality , status ( single , engaged or married ) , and even the ages of people , they will decide to learn in their own country or go abroad for getting english .
On the hand , studying abroad is a great opportunity , especially for young people .
They usually go abroad because they have not so much responsibilities just it prepares their professional future .
But They can only afford it to work as a au pair , waiter , kitchen porter or porter that include accommodation , normal wages and you do n't need high level of english .
On the other hand , you might find yourself getting homesick .
Of course , you leave a lot of things , such as your family , friends , foods , places , own things , etc . , and nobody put up with being very far away from all these things .
Moreover , people about mid 's 30 years old , they do not usually leave their country and try to get new language from are living .
This way is cheap as well and they have not to change everything around their life to achieve this aim .
In addition , with this ages , normally people have more charges , maybe children , mortgage , partner , etc .
From my opinion , the best way for learning really good a language it is living in the same country where people speak it .
So , you do n't hesitate and move to the new country , in which you do not only get language , even different culture and lifestyle .
Trapagaran , environmentally friend
The purpose of this report is to explain the that my town has become more aware in the need of taking care of the countryside .
Since 2010 my town has tried to include some changes to boost the town .
Recycling is the solution
In the last five years many new bins have been situated near all neighbourhoods .
There are four type of rubbish skip .
On one of these bins are destined to plastics , another one is for wood and paper , the third one is a bottlebank and the last one is for cells .
This one is very important because it contaminates so much .
Apart from that , there are other container focused on every type of objects .
For instance , clothes , shoes , toys , electronic devices , etc .
More green areas
This town has not only focused on recycling , it has also promoted green areas .
Because of that 5 new parks has been created recently .
Those are a great place where families have a good time while they enjoy the countryside .
Moreover residents have become more conscious after they have read the leaflets which explain the importance of respect the environment .
Conclusion
I strongly think that it is necessary to make people conscious about the importance of save the planet .
In addition , more people would help if they can recycle easily .

Nowadays people 's life is having an unexpected change all because globalitation .
In the past people has to manage their time so they could go to their work , take care of their children and maybe also study .
Globalitation starts in the 20 's , so a huge amount of population has experience this change , in my opinion is kind of good .
Now people can interact with other people from other countries by texting , facebook or whatsapp .
The need of export and import items has increased in the last 10 years consequently the life of the people has raised in faster respond .
Everyone needs an instant answer to what they asking for , if they send an email you must received it in less than 1 minute .
The personal contact shows a decrease in this time because people do n't want to face their real problems , instead they can see all the poblems happened in the world by their smartphones .
In the future people will comunute between them by their computers , cellphones , tablets and this kind of technology will lead us to a lonely life .
Nowadays , we already have things like smart phones , which can nearly do everything we want to .
And we have some other media gadgets .
But will people 's lives really change so dramatically in the next 50 years ?
In my opinion it wo n't .
I 'm of the opinion that people 's lives wo n't change extremely in the next 50 years .
Of course there will exist some more electronical things like some new handys , with functions we could expect right now , and there will be some other gadgets .
But if we speak of the change of people 's lives there have to be some more dramatically things .
A point would be , that normal people are able to fly to the moon or something , or if there would be people living on the mars .
But I think that this wo n't be able to do .
Even not in 50 years .
To put it in a nutshell we could say that our global world will be more electronical , and there will be more gadgets , but that wo nt change our lives dramatically .
Hi brother ,
I 've been thinking about what you said to me the previous week .
It 's true that we do n't pay attention to our grandma 's .
She loves us and she always looks after us when dad and mum could n't do it .
I believe that we haven't never thanked her what she did and do for us .
For that I 've had the idea of giving her a present .
You 're agree with me , are n't you ?
Yesterday I saw a nice present for her in the new mall of Jerez , called AreaSur .
It was an amazing gold watch .
It seemed not to be very expensive and was luxury and lovely .
I think that a clock would be useful as well as necessary for her .
What do you think about buying it for her ?
If you do n't think the same as me you can choose another present , I wo n't have any problem .
Anyway , we should go to the mall together and there we will take the final decision .
We can go by bus .
You only have to walk through the road in front of home and you will arrive bus station .
Then take the third line and two stops later you will arrive mall .
I will see you there and I 'll guide you in the mall .
I hope to see you soon brother .
Send me an email when you 're able to go shopping

What 's the safest transport in the world ?
And the most comfortable ?
In my opinion any transport is completely safe , however people say the plane is the safest transport .
And , maybe the car is the most comfortable .
It is true that both are advantages and disadvantages .
Travelling by car can be enjoyable , dangerous and relaxing , I knew this is a contradiction , but I can explain it .
Relaxing because you can travel by yourself , with friends and with your family .
When you make a long trip you can go without pressure .
If you are tired you can stop at a petrol station or at a restaurant to relax yourself , and if in the car there are more passengers you can change with them , so you will feel less tired .
Even travel by car , in my opinion , has a lot of problems .
Some advantages could be :
- Gasoline is too expensive
- There are n't enough car parks and they are very expensive , for example when you travel to Madrid it is impossible to find a free parking .
- Often you can be involved in city traffic jams , especially in the rush hour .
This situation only is present in Caceres when there is a rainy day , but in other cities like Madrid , Barcelona … is a daily situation .
I think , driving can be dangerous because people must respect speed limits , and not every time that it is .
People does n't wear the seatbelt , use phones , and even there are who drink when they are going to drive .
All these malpractice can make they have an accident and other innocent persons are in danger .
Every holiday , the DGT , in Spain , make an awareness campaign to remember us the good manners when we are driving .
On the other hand , travelling by plane people say is safer then do it in others transport .
I do n't make sure this affirmation .
I 'm afraid to travel by plane .
I hate the moment when the plane is taking off , and when it is touching off .
I 'm afraid so that started when I was travelling to Mexico in my honeymoon .
In this moment there was a tropical storm , and the turbulences are horrible ; but a not time I have stopped to travel by plane .
I knew is the better option when you want to travel abroad .
It is true , that plane is very expensive , at least I never haven't be able to book a cheap ticket .
I look for the perfect offer but in summer it is impossible to find it .
To sun up , all kind of transport have positive and negative aspects , but depending of our necessity we use one or another .
For example there are a lot of countries where bike is the most main of transport , like Belgium .
I remember there were kilometres and kilometres of cycle line , on the contrary than here in Spain , where few cities like Madrid or Barcelona , strengthen their use .
I do not agree with the situation .
This is simple because not everyone has a personal vehicle .
In addition , because of the gap between the upper class to the lower class people .
Public transport is one part of social development .
It will make people feel comfortable .
The bar chart shows the projected sales of jeans of Mango Co. and Jack&Jones Co.
Next year in Turkey .
we can see the number of the projected sales of jeans of Jack&Jones Co . will be at 450 thousands of pairs in next Jan , it will be higher than the number of the projected sales of jeans of Mango Co. about 300 thousands of pairs .Then the number of Jack&Jones Co . will drop to 250 thousands of pairs in Feb next year .
after this fall , the number of Jack&Jones Co. will rise up gradually until to hit the peak at 90 thousands of pairs in Dec.
The projected sales of khan 's of Mango Co. Next year will begin at 150 thousands of pairs then it will go down a little bit in Feb .
The number of Mango Co. will grow up steadily from May to July next year , it will stay remain at 500 thousands of pairs for four months then get the highest number about 600 thousands of pairs in this period .
The pie chart share illustrates the projected market share of Mango Co.,Jack&Jones Co.and others companies in jeans at the end of next year . Jack&Jones Co.will get 30% of the projected market share in jeans , Mango Co. take 20% of it .
However , others companies will dominte the half of the projected market share in jeans next year .
Very different morning
The doorbell rang .
When I opened the door imagine my surprise there was a small present left on the ground .
I looked around but no one was there . "
Hmm ...
Is that present for me ?
" I asked myself quietly .
Besides I was not sure whether I should take it up .
I looked around one more time but still I did n't see anyone .
As it was quite early in the morning there was just silence everywhere .
I sat down in my kitchen and put the present on the table .
But before opening it I decided to make a cup of green tea to calm down a bit as I felt nervous enough .
While the water was boiling a lot of different thoughts came into my head : " I do n't have any birthday today and there are few more months until Christmas ... What could be the reason for such a nice present wrapped in a pink paper ?
Maybe someone wishes to make some little surprise for me , does n't he ? " " Ok , lets open it !
" I encouraged myself .
Oh , if you knew - that present made my day !
When I opened it I found there my favourite chocolate with very cute ' Thank you ' letter .
I got it from my neighbour and he just was so thankful for my help tidying up his garden week before .
Actually I love receiving presents .
They colour the world , they lift you up !
And there is a truth : the more you give , the more you get back !
Although many people believe that our lives are getting better than they where 20 years ago , scientist proved that if we carry on with our ways of living using , for instance modern technology , we will lose control of our lives .
Technology has reached such a point where we need to do anything in order to achieve something .
To support this idea , a study was conducted 6 months ago .
The study tried to explain people 's reaction to different resources .
People where given the task to write a piece of writing of their choice using the resources already provided by the institution in charge .
Firstly , they were given 5 books of different subjects .
Out of 20 tested people , 17 managed to write their composition within an hour .
Secondly , keeping the main task , they were given a tablet with wireless connection to use instead of books .
This time the study showed that all of the applicants managed to write their essays in less than 30 minutes .
The objective of this study was to see how people adapted to new technologies and how our cultural roots are being forgotten .
Thus , this study concluded that in around 50 years from now , people will have worked , fed , showered and even lived without leaving there homes .
If technology is leading to those kinds of consequences , we should start to realise how to use technology properly without needing to eliminate it .
Dear Sir ,
My name is Montserrat Márquez , I am 23 years old and I am really interested in the advertisement I saw the other day about working on summer camps in the USA . I have worked before but in my home town , Mexico city , and I think I would be a perfect candidate for this job .
As a matter of fact I have been camping since I was 6 years old , for this reason I started working on summer camps when I was 18 years old .
I am a suitable person for the job because I used to work with children of all ages , but I prefer to play with kids between 8 and 12 years old , also I am always trying to improve different activities therefore avoid getting bored , and I do not mind working in other areas of the camp .
To sum up I would like to participate with you , and I can promise you will not regret it , I hope to hear from you soon .
Yours faithfully ,
Montserrat Márquez
It 's nice that you finally decided to come to visit me .
I promise you will not regret to come , everything here is wonderful and there are many places we can go to visit .
Is easy to get to my apartment from the airport , you can take a taxi and tell the driver to take you to the powder street , when you get there you just call me and I get there , my apartment is not far from that street .
Is cheaper to travel by bus but it is not very safe , you need to take a taxi , is a bit more expensive but is much safer .
The weather is changing , in the morning there is high winds , at the afternoon it is sunny , and in the night it is very cold .
You should bring nice but durable clothes .
I 'll wait here , and I really want to see .
Have a good trip .
See you soon .
If you want to become an artist or politician , you must be ready for journalists following you all the time .
I suppose that sometimes celebrities enjoys people gossipping about them .
And of course , unknown actors call for some pieces of attention .
In my opinion they are also people as we are . They have their own life ,
that is why I do n't understand why is it so important for people to know what happenes with celebrity ?
I think it is not so joyfully , when you wake up and see camera 's flash !
Also when you spend time with your boyfriend or girlfriend , you know that someone is taking a photo of you .
In my opinion , each person , without reference is it celebrity or not , deserves his own private life .
Am I right ?
WAYS TO TAKE CARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT
Introduction
The aim of this report is to inform about the ways in which my village carries out measures to look after the environment .
For this , we will analyse several aspects such as what local residents do with the rubbish and how Lanjarón tries to keep the area clean and makes it attractive to people .
Recycling : The best way to deal with the rubbish
Nowadays there is more and more rubbish because of the high amount of package used to wrap products and increase in consumption .
In Lanjarón as in the rest of the villages and towns people are getting used to buying and consuming much more than they used to do in the past .
However , in recent years my village has been promoting ways for people to get ride of the rubbish in a conscious way .
A number of recycling bins have been placed around the village and citizens are being encouraged to join several ongoing courses to raise their awareness of the importance of recycling .
For these reasons , what people usually do with their rubbish in their daily routine is to sort it and put it in the correct bin .
Keeping the village clean and attractive
Lanjarón is one of the most tourist villages in the region La Alpujarra ; therefore , it is very important both for the council and the local residents to keep the village clean .
To get this the council sets different environmental activities for the citizens to take part in .
For instance , monthly it is held a competition where participants have to clean and pick rubbish up from different areas of the village .
At the end of the competition those whose area is cleaner and attractive receive an award .
Conclusion
We have to bear in mind how important the environment is to us .
If we all were aware of this and did something to help it in our daily routines , the planet would thank us for this .
There are two opposite opinions about military service .
On one , hand military service must be mandatory .
Others consider that it is military service is unnecessary and should be voluntary .
First of all , there is no absolutely safety in the modern world .
There are different dangers of a military nature such as terrorist attacks , wars and other armed conflicts .
Therefore , compulsory service at in the army gives special military knowledge , which helps the population to protect their country during a military conflict .
As a result , there are more chances to overcome the conflict with minimum human losses .
Secondly , the mandatory military service can develop the character of a person , making it stronger .
More specifically , it allows for understanding of teamwork , develops organizational skills and practice discipline .
Moreover , it can educate young people be more self - reliant , because the majority of teenagers at the age of 18 do not know how to be independent from their parents .
However , the critics claim that obligatory military service is a waste of time and has a negative impact .
For example , it is difficult to find a good job or go to university after military service , because during the one or two years of service , soldiers do not develop any knowledge except military .
Also , the time spent serving in the army can uproot or separate families or friends ' relations .
Another big problem is that military service is dangerous and has a risk .
There are different physical exercises that can be harmful to health .
Besides , there are emergencies , which can happen with guns or weapons such as explosions and accidents .
Furthermore , there are hazing acts at in the army .
It means that soldiers who have already served some time , bully and beat up new recruits for fun .
These acts often turn out to be tragic having a long post traumatic effect on the young person or even loss of life .
Army years often have an impact on the whole family , especially in case of bullying or the possibility of being sent to the warzone .
Finally , there is a very complex topic and both opinions have advantages and disadvantages , but it can be seen that the military situation is unstable in the world .
This means that people need to know how to protect themselves and military services is a good way for it .
I prefer to eat at home
Firstly , the food I make by myself is more trustful than the food that is made in restaurants .
Because I do n't know what kinds of ingredients the restaurant put .
Also the food I make by myself is much healthier .
Because all of the restaurants want to earn money , so they will just use cheap and not healthy ingredients to cook the food .
But if I make my own food , of course I wo n't use any kind of unhealthy ingredients .
So the food I made by my own hands is safer than any other food that is made in restaurants .
And also homemade food has better quality than low price restaurants .
Secondly , it 's much cheaper to eat at home , because restaurants want to earn money .
So you can save lots of money if you cook at home .
Some people think cooking themselves is too annoying or tired so they go out to eat .
But actually if you cook much you can use your energy so you can consume your weight .
Also if you cook three times a day your cooking ability will go up .
Thirdly , eating at home is more comfortable .
When people are surrounded by strangers people all think they are watching me so I ca n't do that or this .
But if you eat at home you do n't need to be caring that somebody will look at you open your mouth too big or talk too loud .
Also the restaurant do n't know how much you can eat , so sometimes they give you too less food you do n't get full .
Or sometimes they give you too much food so you have to throw it away .
And as you know , throwing food away is a bad habit to do which makes our planet , Earth will be polluted
Fourthly , you wo n't have to waste your time going out to find a restaurant and come back home .
And sometimes if there are many customers you have to wait for the chef to cook other 's food first . You can save time if you eat at home .
Fifthly , we can have a family time while eating .
Of course , it does n't mean that you ca n't talk with families when you eat outside .
But if you eat at home with your family you can have a joke while preparing dishes or talk about their own private life things .
Because it 's not feel free to talk anything outside because the people at the next table might hear what you are talking about .
So by having a family time while eating home you can have a talk and be a much closer family .
Because of these kinds of advantages and reasons I prefer to eat at home .
To sum up , the fundamental characteristic of social media is the design of " Virtual profile " , it requires time to maintain connection between links , friends and be part of groups , this connections will produce negatives effects especially on psychological well - being .
This outcome , along with several studies suggests reasonable use of connection media .
However , it is also likely that people 's life , such as loneliness and depression , might explain the effects that social media can have .
Furthermore , it is also possible that in a future people will be a subject responses , posts and chat rooms , in which awareness of wrong vocabulary , poor routines and compulsive use .
In contrast , one positive aspect of social media cover the education area , in which the knowledge , the expansion of ideas , and the discover of different ways of learning will contribute in the community .
Some people claim that life will change a lot in the next five decades , but , how will it change ?
On the one hand we have technology .
Technology has developed really fast in the last twenty years so it 's expected to develop the same way in the next fifty years .
Cell phones are a great example of this evolution .
Fifteen years ago cell phones did n't have music or a camera , while nowadays they have camera with high definition and you can download a lot of music .
On the other hand we have transport .
Right now people are starting to buy hydraulic cars which is more eco friendly and cheaper because you do n't need to spend money in gas .
Basing on this we can assume that this kind of cars will be the only ones on the streets fifty years from now .
Science will also change .
Every aspect of science will evolve , for example new medical discoveries will be made by doctors .
Chemistry may have the chance in the next fifty years to confirm their theories about the existence of atoms .
To sum up I believe that people lives will change a lot because everything will evolve .
I 'm a teenagers and I like to watch movies as other teenagers .
My favourite kinds are comedis , detective and love stories .
I mostly like comedies because they create my mood put me in high spirites .
They help me to develop and to see the world to a difernt perspective .
People like to watch movies , because it 's a fun pastime and it substitutes books for lazy people .
Many people think living in the counrtyside provides a better way of life .
Most of us think it 's a great idea , but is it better than our comfortable life in the city ?
Would we live better without technology ?
As we know the countryside has no pollution compared to big towns , because there are n't cars , lorries , moped or any other motor vehicle .
If we lived there , we would eat healthier food with no chemicals , what it 's good .
On the other , hand technology makes our life easier .
We can get information , chat with friends or even order food instantly with Internet , however unfortunately we do n't have it in the countryside
I agree with people who think they would have no problem to leave their lives and start a new job in a farm only to be in touch with nature .
However I think humans have evolved and we are very happy with technology and Internet .
There is no doubt that using your private car is much more comfortable & convenient for any person .
Your car represents a kind of luxury & comfort which is clearly illustrated during driving or travelling for long distances as long as you have a comfortable seat with a certain personal zone area .
Moreover , you can control your driving speed as fast or slow according to your mood and so you own your time .
In addition to that , you can take some rest amidst the journey .
Even after your arrival , you will have your own car to go here & there fleetly & freely whenever you like so you have a flexible schedule .
Furthermore , you are not accompanied by some silly passengers or difficult persons during your trip as you will relish your trip with some adorable friends , nice family 's members or close colleagues that you have chosen .
Besides the presence of a car during a trip is very important for coping with the different conditions environments you are facing during the journey .
On the other hand , public transport now become non hygienic as lots of people are crowded into a small and closed area and so a lot of breathes & air droplets are easily propagated in this enclosed place and consequently , you are more susceptible to the various contagious diseases especially in the winter season where the respiratory tract infections flourish e.g. cold & flu .
Furthermore , your actions and movements are limited by the schedule and the track of the transportation mean you are taking .
And so you do n't own your time to do what you want whenever you like although this is my leisure , my free time which means the time of relaxation & meditation .
No More alarms or noisy alerts are required during this important and nice period of time .
My town is one of the cleanest towns in my country , the authorities have been arranged amny procedures to ensure that the town keeps clean at the same time be environmentally friendly procedures .
As a first step to keep the environment clean and healthy is that the garbage needs to be separated into 3 parts that is why the environment department decided to give each house three recycle bins , one for food and green garbage , one for only papers and catroons and the last is for the rest .
Another handy rule has been decided which is the plastic and the glasses need to be thrown in different bins that are available for the public udsage in each supermarket center , in these people can find these bins in easy destinations available everywhere .
All the previous steps and more are being applied by my town sitizens in order to improve the environment quality and go long with all the procedures that help them live happily healthy life .
There should be a future for public transport .
It is more important than ever for anyone to think before using own car .
Firstly , we have a big issue on global warming . We can not deny that we have more and more extreme weather around the glove due to green house gases .
We are damaging our planet .
Secondly , we all know the fossil fuels , we mainly run our vehicles by , will not last forever .
We are using up our vital resource in fast pace .
We are used to just turn the lights or air - conditioning on when we do n't really need it .
It is exactly the same for driving cars .
A lot of us , just turn the engine of our cars without considering walking up to the bus stop .
Public transport system in the UK has so many problems to solve .
The fare is high compared to other European countries and the fare system is complicated .
The punctuality of trains needs to improved greatly , too .
In my opinion , we need to save future for public transport for our future and it is vital to reduce the use of private cars . Travelling by car is more convenient but with improved public transport , we need to reduce use of cars .
That is our responsibility for future generation .
All in one - come and watch
Have you ever been asked to make a decision and choose only one thing out of many that you really like ?
I am sure you have .
And then you always wonder what would have happened if you had chosen the alternative .
Maybe you just missed something really special ...
You do not particularly like that feeling , do you ?
There is a group of young people who decided once that it is ridiculous to choose if you can have all in one - do you want to meet them ?
Actually , you will have a chance soon .
The Red Dragon Theatre Group is coming to our town next week .
They will bring a lot of good sense of humour , music , dance , and anything you can think of that should appear on stage .
Their main concern is to make you think , laugh , maybe cry a bit , but above all to give you a great time .
I bet you will love them at first sight .
To make the long story short - you can not miss this event !
The group is going to perform in The Globe theatre and they have promised to meet your expectations .
The choice is obvious this time ...
Simply , come and watch .
' Gravity ' is an otstanding , brilliant , sci - fi film , directed by Alfonso Cuaron , starring George Clooney and Sandra Bullock .
This amazing film is about two people from a crew of astronauts sent out in space to launch the ' HUBBLE ' telescope .
Soon one of them was informed that an asteroid hit a satellite and created debris , which was heading for the Shuttle , where the two astronauts were .
Eventually the debris hit the Shuttle and thus more debris was created which took the orbit of Earth and moved around it with a very high speed .
The damages which the impact of the debris caused to Shuttle were catastrophic !
All of the crew but two were killed .
To survive the astronauts had to get to the International Space Station which was very far away from them .
Moving to the ISS one of them lost his life and so only one of the crew remains alive fighting for the survival .
After the long sequence of events the remaining astronaut first got to the ISS then with Russian spacekraft moved on to the Chinese space station called TIANGONG .
And so the astronaut launched the escape pod and got home !
Her struggle for survival occurs to be successful !
" Gravity " is indeed a great film and moreover , I myself recommend it to you , students .
My hometown , Piliyandala , is probably the smallest town in Colombo district provides shelter for more than 100,000 people .
The town has approximately 15 villages and all of them are governed by the urban council .
The Garbage control service is one of the main supporting subsidiaries of the urban council which was founded two years ago .
Five years ago , the town did n't have any garbage control services to manage the domestic rubbish .
With this garbage control system , household waste being collected on weekly basis and transported to recycling centers .
The recycling centers sort these garbage and are put into different categories to be recycled , categorized garbage are then transported to the recycling process in the nearest factory .
Two years ago , the council started a wastebasket distributing program among the villages with the intention of easing the garbage collection process .
With this approach , it is very convenient for the workers who are engaged in the garbage control service because they can collect all the garbage of a village in one place .
Meanwhile , the urban council highly discourage the use of plastic products and other artificial materials for the sake of our own cleanliness .
Villages on the other hand , doing their best to reduce the load of domestic waste .
Nowadays lots of people are discussing the problems of life in the next 50 years . in 50 years ,
surely , science and technology will
progress , and this could have some pros and cons .
I think that in 50 years the public transport will be more efficient .
planes , trains and buses will be faster and maybe thanks to the progress of technology we could beam - up every where .
Also thanks to the progress of medicine we will achieve some important goals .
doctors will be able to cure also lethal diseases .
This will be a great achievement !
body - communication , for example , will lose his importance . all the communication will be virtual , people will speak only on social networks .
I think that this will be dramatic ! also all relationships and friendships will be virtual , and that is absurd .
we will become robots , no longer people !

Faces in the Crowd is an excellent option for those like me who love watching thriller movies .
It tells the story of a beautiful woman , played by the always stunning and talented actress Milla Jovovich , who is pulled off a bridge by a mysterious serial killer .
Despite surviving the attack , Milla loses the ability of recognize faces , and thus she can not tell people apart , which means anyone could be the psycho who tried to kill her , and she could be in great danger .
As time goes by , Milla learns how to identify people 's body gestures , as she becomes more confident with her new ability , her life come slowly back to normal , but not for too long , for she becomes suspicious the murderer can be closer then she would ever expect .
No one can figure it out until the very end .
People are young or old , rich or poor , go through stages of ups and downs in their lives .
For most of friends in the dorm of University of Education , Mimi is just an ordinary girl , neither beautiful nor smart .
But for Michael , she is his world .
He loves Michael at first sight when he first met and tried to take any advantages of opportunities to win her heart .
There is no doubt that the Southerner in Vietnam have prejudices against Northerner for a long time .
It is unfortunate for Michael to get access to her because she is a Southerner .
Overcoming much prejudices and obstacles from her family , he proved to be a loyal and sincere man who Mimi can lay her hope on .
But everything has changed since he came to Danang city to further study .
He began to have intimate relationships with other beautiful young girls there and broke his promises- " Wait for me !
I love you forever and I will come back very soon .
I'll never love any girls but you " .
In terms of love , he did n't love her anymore but he still kept contact with her .
Poor Mimi!.
She did n't know anything and still waited in pain .
She could have got married with a talented man if she had n't believed in what Michael had said to her .
Everything is fine until the end of last summer when she had some days off and made an important decision to go on a holiday trip to visit her boyfriend without any notice for him as a resault of causing completely surprises .
Never in her life had she been to as crowded a city as Danang so she feft very nervous but extremely excited about meeting her lover soon .
Right after from taking off the plane , she traveled to his dorm to meet him with a view of satisfying her long waiting for him .
The more excited she is , the more dissappointment she had . Mimi catch sight of her lover was kissing another young girl in his room .
She burst into tears making efforts to leave that room as fast as possible .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Dear Mikel ,
Hey!how are you ? How is life going ? Hope your done with your prestigious exams that you told me about .
Anyway I ve recently been organizing an environment saving event for our breathtaking city by doing a recycling campaign .
Since your dad has recycling factory I taught that he would be pleased getting the bottles and the other recyclable material as well .
Aswell as you know in our country there 's trash being thrown everywhere and most of the things that are thrown are recyclabe .
This is the main reason why our environment is getting destoryed .
The charity I chose to invest in was the envirosavers charity , as they have recently done a good job in re - building animal habitats so I taught that they might need money since they just spend money in building habitats .
İn the event there will be charged entertainments for all age groups , there will be live music , we also have a lottery which will be going on .
Waiting for your response and help on they day do n't forget no amount is too small .
Ertan
Hi Mary !
Thank you for your letter .
It was great to hear from you .
It has been such a long time since we wrote to each other .
The first thing I want to say is that I am really surprised about you finally decide to start with music 's lessons .
You never told me that you were thinking of playing an instrument .
What kind of instrument are you going to play ?
In my opinion , you should try to organise a schedule for your activities .
Do nt forget to have time enough to go out with your family and friends there !
If I were you , I would try a period of proof for a month .
If you do n't follow the schedule , you should give up one of them .
For instance , you have been doing sport since I met you so as to give up it for a season .
Do n't you think so ?
I hope that 's useful.good luck and let me know how you get on .
Looking forward to hearing from you soon
Dear Mrs Elisa Stephens ,
I 'm Vincenzo Manna , an engineering student who , by means of linguaenglish , is going to spend three weeks in Brighton ( as you already know , my colleague Gelsomina Davide and I are arriving next 27th of July ) .
I would like to ask you just a piece of information .
Once I arrive at the airport , is it better to catch a bus or a train which let me reach Brighton ?
Surfing the Internet , I have found that if I catch a bus I will be able to get off in several station ( Coach station , Patcham , Preston Circus and so on ... ) while travelling by train I can choose between Brighton and New Brighton .
So , could you tell me what is the best way to reach your house ?
I hope to improve my English skills thanks to this journey , and especially my listened and spoken English .
In fact , I am studying a lot to pass the CAE examination ( Certificate in Advanced English ) , but I am facing several difficulties .
Also for this reason , I have chosen to spend this period in a family .
Indeed , I think this is the best way to improve , listening to and speaking with native English people .
I 'm looking forward to seeing you soon ,
Yours sincerely ,
Vincenzo Manna
My name is Pawarit Chonlahat so I lived in Bangkaen district since 2010.I found that this area is changed so rapidly , such as , Now it have a lot of condomedium were buildeda long the main road and nowaday this area has a big shopping mall and modern hospital and large police station that 's make my life so convenience and safe because i can walk from my house to go to shopping mall about 10 minutes other that i can walk to hospital just about 5 minute so i did n't worry when i got sick and The large police station is set in front of the hospital that can assure safety for everyone who live in this area .
For this reason , This is the adventages of living in this area but because of many populations in this area that make traffic in every rush hours especially in the morning very jam and take so long time to drive a car to work that is the disadvantages for living in this area so , In my opinion , this area should have improved transportation infrastructure like investment in Sky train system to link covered around this area .
Mary and Amber were having lunch at a restaurant .
They were very excited about choosing the foods on the menu because they were first time eating here .
However , Mary saw a young man with baseball cap taking away something .
When she saw the second time , she found that was Amber 's backpack .
Mary yelled loudly at the young man to call him stop and everyone in the restaurant noticed about him .
The young man dropped down the backpack rapidly and tried to run away .
To his surprised , Amber and the manager of this restaurant had already stood in front of the door .
The manager told them that this guy had stolen many stores in the town , finally they got him .
As a result , even thought he kept expressing his apologist to Amber , she still decided to call the police .
After the police took him away , Mary and Amber kept enjoying their food .
The best of all is that the manager said their meal is free .
Although the two movies are of complete different genres , similarities still exist .
The stories of Stephanie and Ali in Rust and Bones , and Pat and Tiffany in the Silverlinings Playbook all began with their lives going through life - altering events .
In Rust and Bones , Stephanie injures herself in a brawl outside of a club and wakes up to realize she had her legs amputated .
Ali , an unemployed father in his mid-20s who is struggling to make ends meet and support his young son , saves Stephanie and helps her get back on her feet .
As they support each other through their hardships , love stems .
Similarly , Pat and Tiffany were also going through hard times when they first met .
Pat had just gotten out of rehab for bipolar disorder whereas Tiffany , a widow , who had just lost her job .
Once again , their relationship began as friends and transforms into love as they help each other conquer personal challenges .
In sum , both movies portrayed love as a chemistry reaction that stems out when two people willing to help each other out of life challenges .
In the movie of Rust and Bone , Ali takes Stephanie going out and swimming , even has sex with her , helping Stephanie to restore her life .
On the other hand , after Ali starts his kickboxing career , Stephanie always cares about his conditions , then becomes his middleman .
Same as Rust and Bone , in the movie of Silver Linings Playbook , Pat companies with Tiffany to break away from the past ; and Tiffany help Pat to get the courage to find the way back into love .
All they want to do is to repair the love meanings and find happiness in their life .
Both the movies lead happy endings to the leads .
In the end of Rust and bone , Stephanie is back to her life because of Ali 's support .
Ali realizes he loves Stephanie and he wo n't be the man he used to be anymore , who do n't believe in love and only want one night stand .
And in Silver Linings Playbook , Pat and Tiffany , who both used to stuck in their misfortune in the pass , leave their pass behind and move on with each other 's love and support .
This two movies give us a concept : no matter how worse the lives are , love can make people brave and find out the value of lives again .
Albeit those things in common , at the beginning of the movies , the depression of characters came from different situation .
Pat and Tiffany are trapped in their psycologically difficulties ; Pat 's desire of his ex - wife can not be fulfilled , while Tiffany can not get over her guilty of her husband 's death .
However , characters in Rust and Bone are suffering from declined life quality ; Stephanie lost her legs , and Ali is an impecunious man .
Although their hearts are all empty , the harsh environment is more hard to survive .
In addition , love is portrayed in different ways in these two movies .
Silver Linings Playbook , as a Hollywood movie , describes the love story in a hilarious tone .
The scene is bright and the rhythm is light even if in the saddest section .
Rust and Bone , on the other hand , presents story in a realistic way .
The director does not avoid brutal scenes because those are exactly parts of real life .
In conclusion , every love movie may be interpreted in diverse ways , whereas people could always find distinct inspiration .
In my opinion , being included in the fresh TV news is a huge contribution , great opportunity to introduce yourself in the way you like it .
It is possible to find many examples which confirms that argument .
In these times , we can follow sbd 's Twitter newsfeed , ' like ' his Faceboog fanpage and , of course , follow news about those famous people .
They 're being followed constantly by paparazzi , their private photos are being bought for millions of dollars .
Of course being in a similar situation does n't seem to be easy but I think that it is one of the prices of being famous .
We should n't underestimate the importance of societal and environmental problems .
They both must be solved because of their great negative influence on the world .
On the one hand , I think that the most significant is societal problems because they cause other problems including environmental one .
People always use nature and its resources to satisfy their needs .
However , people have exploited the nature since the last century .
Their activities caused lots of negative consequences such as air , water and land pollution , deforestation and climate change .
These issues are so burning in developing countries .
Whereas developed countries became aware of these problems , poor countries have plenty of societal problems , so they continue to influence the environment in a negative way .
That 's why I consider that societal issues are the most dangerous .
For example , developing countries can not protect the environment because of their poverty , low incomes , and population illiteracy .
On the other hand , sometimes environmental problems can be a reason for societal one .
It took place when some natural disasters happened .
Such disasters as earthquakes , floods and tornados affect a lot of people every year .
It has an unwilling impact on society as people are forced to save their lives , leave or renovate their houses , look for clothes , food and others .
Unfortunately , we can not pretend natural disasters , but we can solve societal problems .
In my opinion , the main decision is to develop people 's potential , increase their awareness of personal effects on nature .
If people take responsibility for their actions , we will avoid plenty of consequences .
As for me , we can achieve this through developing leadership .
We must have strong leaders who will strive for a beautiful world .
People ca n't satisfy their limitless needs ; they think only about their wealth .
A good leader must form a society , show an example and provide better values for people .
He must inspire others to achieve appropriate goals and to do their best for the world .
In my organization , we strive for peace in the world .
We believe that we can develop leadership in each person and such ways we can avoid a lot of global problems .
This exchange program will give me the required knowledge that I can use effectively to develop Ukrainian society .
Sometimes I have an opportunity and desire to do something whereas I do n't know how to do it properly .
I hope this international experience will teach me how to work on increasing country welfare .
Though the new problems occur quickly in our state some people and community , try to do their best to develop the civil and democratic society .
We need external help to find out how to cope with both societal and environment problems .
Moreover , our country pays little attention to them so population should do everything on their own .
For instance , I hope I will be able to get to know everything about recycling rubbish and economizing energy .
These skills are necessary for us , and they help us to improve a little our ecological situation .
In conclusion , each problem must be solved concerning societal and environmental issues that impede a further progress of our civilization .
What is more , this project will give me available experience including specific skills that I can use to spread healthy tendency in the social sphere and careful attitudes to the environment .
Television can entertain everybody today , it does n't matter the age , can be a baby or an oldest person , we can notice that there are interesting topics for all kinds of audience .
It 's a multimedia device that while you watch TV , you can listen and see other people or cartoons , and it seems the characters are alive talking directly to you .
Today the networks have a schedule of 24 hours of activities , you can watch the programs at any time you want to , and if you do n't like a program you can change the channel and watch anything else , if the increase of channels and the competitiveness , the audience has increased also its power of choice .
We have the power to choose what we want , but with so many options we must be aware of our own decisions , I want to say that , although we have so many options , not all of them are effective for us , we are able to decide if we 'd rather see a comedy or a documentary .
The programs tend to reproduce our real life and our desires , such as a soap opera which presents characters with difficult in their lives , but there are also the solution of all problems at the end , the lady get married and live happily with his love forever .
Although they have a nice ending we need to remember that the real life is different and the difficult makes part of our lives , they are there to us to give value to everything we have and to remember us how fragile and , at the same time , how powerful we are .
We can also watch a documentary that teach us a lot !
There are documentaries produced with so many careful that they provide us with a lot of information , sometimes it 's much better than reading a book or having a class .
Having said that , we just need to remember to be aware of what we want to receive from TV while we are choosing a program to watch and be happy with our choices !
Pros and cons - cars in major city centres
In the last 10 years , every second family has more than one car and most of the times each member of the family drives his own car .
Many of the automobile owners live in big towns and often they park their cars in the city centres , where they work or study .
Recently , governments in many countries , put a ban for parking or even a ban for driving in major city centres , because this leads to increasing traffic jams .
Moreover , cars pollute the air significantly and it becomes unhealthy for breathing .
In many towns are built underground parking places , where you can leave your car when you have some work in the city centre .
Only public transport is permitted on the main streets , because it is used from lot of people .
Some drivers are not keen on this ban , because this is inconvenient for them .
They do not like travelling with buses or trams .
In my opinion , these measures related to ban of cars in the city centres are effective and limit the traffic jam and the air pollution .
How does Shakespeare make ' A Midsummer Night 's Dream ' magical ?
In ' A Midsummer Night 's Dream ' Shakespeare creates a magical mood and setting by using characters , such as the fairies , and events ( such as transforming Bottom 's head into a donkey 's head ) .
The use and misuse of magic of magic plays a vital role in ' A Midsummer Night 's Dream ' .
Each character in this play , who is able to do magic , uses it in a different way , for example : to help ; for their own need .
The good use of magic is when Oberon use ' love in idleness ' to make or rather " force " Demetrius to fall in love with Helena .
He uses it to help her and try to solve the problems in the lovers relation ship as Lysander and Demetrius are in love with Hermia consequently Helena in love with Demetrius .
It 's almost a love triangle !
The misuse of magic is when it causes an argument between the Athenians .
As Puck mistakes Lysander for Demetrius and squeezes the potion into his eye , the whole conflict begins .
This whole dispute could have been avoided if not for Puck 's mistake .
However , just as magic caused this chaos , it also resolved in it .
Without the misuse of magic , the plot would n't be the same .
There 's be no humour to make it interesting .
In this play , the fairies are almost like the heart of the book .
It is because of the magic of the fairies , the actions in this book is like a dream .
The fairies nearly control everything .
The weather changes due to Oberon and Titania 's argument , which makes ' contagious fogs'(2:1:90 ) and ' hoary - headed frosts'(2:1:107 ) .
The fairies also affect nature as Oberon 's and Titania 's dispute results in the wind ' piping ' to them in ' vain'(2:1:88 ) .
Due to having fairies as characters , it adds magic as fairies do n't exist in the human world .
It creates unreality and fantasy .
The beautiful language of the fairies ( verse ) takes us away from the ordinary human world that usually talk in prose .
The fairies ' magic is built by the contrast of the lives of the fairies and " mortals " .
As a reoccurring theme , Puck 's use of magic creates humour , conflict and balance in the play .
Puck 's magic also adds to his naughty , cheeky , attractive character in this play .
The magic of turning Bottom 's head into one of an ass ' , adds more humour to already the self - confident character of Bottom .
This also leads to more humour as Titania falls in love with Bottom and calls him her ' sweet love'(4:3:30 ) .
It also creates the comparison of Titania , a beautiful , delicate creature , whilst Bottom is completely grotesque .
The idea of Titania having a ' flowery bed'(4:1:1 ) and the idea of Bottom , at that time , looking ' monstrous ' and ' strange'(3:1:91 ) creates a distinction .
The image of the elegant fairy queen referring to a man with a donkey head as her ' lover'(3:2:186 ) seem ridiculous .
Oberon 's use of magic is mainly used to help people .
As well as for his need , he uses his magic to help ' A sweet Athenian lady ' ' in love'(2:2:260 ) namely Helena with her situation with Demetrius in Act 2 .
Therefore , he is shown as a sympathetic character .
However , Oberon also uses his magic to get the changeling boy from Titania .
When Oberon finds out that Puck has transformed Bottom 's head into a donkey 's head , he gets annoyed at first at Puck 's mistake but later realizes that Titania has fallen in love with a ' vile thing'(2:2:40 ) , a man with an ass ' head .
In the book , Titania does n't seem to use her magic much , nevertheless , she uses it a few times .
Titania 's uses her magic to ' bless'(5:1:383 ) the bride bed so that Theseus and Hippolyta would have beautiful children and live a happy , married life .
In the book , she is n't shown using it for her own need .
Titania 's fairies are also characters who use magic . They use it to protect their ' fairy queen'(2:2:12 ) from ' spotted snakes with double tongue ' , ' newts and blindworms'(2:2:9 - 11 ) .
Their magic , like Oberon , is used to help people nevertheless not for themselves .
Also , the fairies language is magical as most of their lines are spells and sound as if they were in a fairy tale .
The clothes of the fairies and their lives are also magical .
The place where Titania sleeps is full of ' oxlips ' and ' eglantine ' .
She sleeps on a bower and she wants a fan made of wings of butterflies .
The food they eat like ' apricocks'(3:1:152 ) and ' mulberries ' ( 3:1:153 ) sound exotic as well as not being our daily meals or snacks which also shows another contrast between the humans and fairies .
The fruits , used above , also sound like ones that would be found in a forest(berries ) .
The language of the fairies creates magic by imagery that is absolutely exquisite .
Most of us probably haven't heard of ' oxlips ' ( 2:2:250 ) and ' woodbine'(2:2:251 ) .
Even the sound of these two words sound like fantasy .
Shakespeare 's choice of words creates this .
He talks about ' musk - roses'(2:1:252 ) and ' wild thyme'(2:2:249 ) giving us this image of this beautiful land , with green grass and all sorts of flowers .
This image will probably look like where the fairies live or associate it with a fairy tale .
By doing this , we begin to realize the magic in this play .
In ' A Midsummer Night 's Dream ' there are many spells , e.g.
Flower of this purple dye ,
Hit with Cupid 's archery ,
Sink in apple of his eye .
When his love he doth espy ,
Let her shine as gloriously
As the Venus of the sky .
When thou wak'st , if she be by ,
Beg of her remedy .
OBERON(3:2:102 - 109 )
The language used in this spell contains many references to nature ( ' Venus ' and ' Sky ' ) .
This is how it creates magic and creates the setting as in William Shakespeare 's time , they did n't use many props .
Just by reading this , you can imagine this fairy king chanting a spell on a purple flower called ' love in idleness ' and you can understand Cupid ( the Greek god of love ) had blessed this flower with his archery , giving you an understanding that this is a love potion .
Shakespeare has also used metaphors and similes such as ' let her shine as gloriously as the Venus of the sky ' to create the thought that Helena should look like a ' goddess , nymph , ' in addition to being ' perfect ' and ' divine'(3:2:137 ) .
He uses indirect word , e.g. He does n't just say love potion .
Shakespeare says ' Flower of this purple dye , Hit with Cupid 's archery ' causing mystery and letting us think about what he means .
Shakespeare also uses the idea of magic in his conversations with other characters for example : when Titania speaks to Oberon in 2:1:60 - 145 , she mentions nature many times .
She refers to the Moon as ' the governess of floods'(2:1:103 ) and refers to the seasons quite a lot .
She describes the winter as ' angry'(2:1:112 ) as Winter is sometimes thought of a miserable season .
The fairies recite their sentences as if they were a poem or song . '
Spotted snakes ' and ' Thorny hedgehogs'(2:2:9 - 10 ) are references to animals .
Animals , insects and plants are commonly referred to in ' ' A Midsummers Night 's Dream ' and these descriptions add to the magic .
It creates the sense that the fairies thought that the animals were dangerous and the way they describe them engages the reader .
The description of the animals and insects makes them seem as if they were evil spirits to the fairies and spirits are magical .
This play also refers to ' sleep ' and dreams .
After all the book is called ' A Midsummers Night 's Dream ' .
Due to the magic , the bizarre events were interpreted as a dream as there 's be no easier way to make the humans understand the events that had just happened .
Thinking of it as a dream creates innocence and vulnerability .
Also , the thought of all four lovers having the same dream makes it seem strange and magical to them .
Also , Shakespeare uses the thought of plays .
He adds the play ' Pyramus and Thisbe ' which is a bit like a mini play based on the storyline ' A Midsummers Night 's Dream ' as there are two lovers whose parents do n't permit their marriage .
When the ' mechanicals ' or workers change into their characters , it is a bit like magic .
The characters in the play like ' moonlight ' are basic ideas of transformations like ones that magic creates .
Also , there is the idea of the alteration of form that Bottom 's head gets ' translated'(3:1:104 ) expresses the magical feeling that again this is not possible in the human world .
Potions are also used to show a sense of magic .
In the human world , they did n't use spells or potions .
At this time , the idea of potions might seem unrealistic and silly but by reading this and the events the potion conjures creates magic .
The effect that ' love in idleness ' has in the play , creates the plot and so potions play a main role in the book .
Without magic , the play would not have the same elements of humour .
Also , the absence of magic would alter the overall plot .
The repetitive theme of magic plays a significant role in the play .
To summarize my points , I personally think that Shakespeare presented magic in the play by using thoughts such as transformations , spells , potions and aspects that do n't exist in the human world .
I personally think , without magic , this book will not be as popular or engaging .
Shakespeare has done it again !

Nowadays most schools and universities are helping students to find their most suitable jobs .
This is caused by the changes that the labor market has experimented recently .
Enterprises want to recruit young and experienced people and universities and schools have noticed that so they are hands on the task .
I shall consider two of the proposed methods .
It has been suggested to offer " work experience programs " .
Students will be able to know deeply their task as employers .
It seems a brilliant idea not only because of the knowledge that they acquire but for the experience that it could bring them .
Some enterprises require experienced employers and if young people have it , they will be more likely to be recruited in the workplace .
So , including in the CV the experience , seems to me , a step further in the students ' career .
Another way to encourage students to find the perfect job would be courses and qualification .
I entirely share this idea .
Universities are supposed to give their students information about the skills that a work involves .But sometimes universities gives them more theoretical formations instead of practical formation which enterprises are searching .
Generally speaking students finish their degrees with a limited range of experience .
I would therefore argue that the best way to help students is to combine a kind of " training " for their work life and some theoretical knowledge .
They have to learn the skills that a job involve and the only way to get this is practicing .
Now a day 's we are having " n " number of International Sports , where one can prove their own talent and have their socialism .
My favourite sport is Badminton because we can have lots of fun while playing .
The shape of the court is in rectangle and is divided in half by a net .
The mode of playing can be single 's or double 's .
There are six main shorts : the serve , the clear , the smash , the drop , the forehand and the backhand .
It 's a good exercise to make one fit and easy to play .
The fun in this game is we need to drop the shuttlecock on the other side of the court and wait 's until the opponent responses to it .
My suggestion for the people who wants to start their hobby as badminton , firstly one need to know the rules and regulations of the play .
As it 's a mind set game , the player need to focus on the weaknesses and act accordingly .
To be a successful player one has to learn some tricks , which helps their game easier .
And last but not least as a player one has to keep in mind that , they should not get depressed when they feel that their game is going out of their hands , where instead of that one has to fight until the last mint of the game in order to decide whether the player is winner or loser .
Thus by boosting themselves lead to success .
Hi Jo ,
I am very pleased to hear that you finally manage to open your restaurant .
I 'm really sorry that I can not accept your offer to work at your restaurant .
I 'm very busy with my new job and with the kids .
But I have someone in mind that can help you at the restaurant is my sister Sorina you met her at my party .She is a lovely girl , hard working , flexible you will love to work with her .
She has lot of experience , she worked in a restaurant for 5 years and also can cook .
Let me know if you are interested to know her better .
Yours ,
Stela
I am very glad to hear that you will come to my country .
In Viet Nam , many places are worth travelling such as Da Lat , Sa Pa , or especially Ninh Thuan .
I went to Ninh Thuan two weeks ago , and I could make sure that it is one of the most beautiful beaches in Viet Nam .
From Ho Chi Minh City , you could go easily to Ninh Thuan by train and it takes you only 6 hours .
VH Bay in Ninh Thuan is assumed as one of the best bays in Viet Nam so that I especially recommend you to go there .
To experience well , you should stay here at least three days .
Last time , I just had a chance to stay for two days , and I felt regret when I got home .
Looking for a job in Viet Nam is not easy for a foreigner like you now .
However , if you are able to cook , I think you will be fine .
Besides , you could sell your own food on the streets , which sounds very interesting .
Just keep thinking about these advise and let me know if you have any concerns .
I am looking forward to seeing you .
Meet the Film Club every Monday at the College theatre
A student group use to meet at the College Theatre every Monday for watching films and afterward discuss about them , but you 're not alone !
Each Monday there is invited a different guest speaker to the Film Club for manage the discussion with a good drink thanks to the Coffee Bar special late opening .
Famous directors as Ridley Scott and Alejandro Amenábar came to the club in the last weeks .
They spoke about their films from a point of view that will discover you a new wonderful way of interpret the meaning of the iconic messages that they 've introduce into their movies .
On the next season there 's going to be a new cycle about WWII and Tom Hanks and Matt Damon will visit the Film Club for speaking about the film where they appeared " Saving Private Ryan " and their process to get involved into their characters for a real - like acting .
CONCLUSION
If you love the cinema or if you only want to take a break in your daily routine and meet new people and make new friends you ca n't lose this great opportunity to turn a grey Monday into an amazing start of the week .
Some people argue that , when the weekend is coming they wonder what to do just for one day!They would like to have a rest .
However , they want to go out and spend time with their families , as well .
So , where to go ? What to do ?
I 'm suggesting you choose between two different places : beach or mountain .
If you prefer to go to the beach but you are not sure what to do there , here are some special ideas to consider .
Fisrt of all , remember to take food that can be eaten easily without much mess ( Spanish omelette , fried chicken brest , sandwiches , ships ... ) and , moreover , you can buy some drinks and water because it is fun to eat at the beach and people usually get hungry often after they do something like swimming , jumping the waves , surfing and so on .
Playing in the sand burying people one another or making sandcastles might be a great way to spend a day outdoors .
Nevertheless , if you do n't like sand at all , you can choose the other option in the mountain .
It could be a different way to spend a quiet day in a peaceful , placid and restful place .
Furthermore , going on a hike among trees with a cool breeze around you can be the kind of place that allows you to forget the busy ciy life , though .
Theerefore , which one of these two places would you choose ?
In my opinion , no matter where you go , just take your camera and take photos in order to be able to remember that wonderful , amazing even unforgettable moment .
At the end , the most important thing is to have and enjoy a relaxing time .
Purpose
The purpose of this report is to showcase the in which power consumption is reduced , joined by the saving of natural resources in my city .
Measures being taken
In Cluj , in each year , during the summer , the local authorities give citizens the opportunity to rent bicycles , thing that can reduce the air pollution produced by car fumes .
They also encourage people to use bicycles not to consume so much fuel .
Their success
Surprisingly , people support this project and every year the number of bicycles rented raises .
More andmore people start wondering about their health , thing that makes them use their cars not as often as they used to .
More things that could be done
The localauthorities can also organise events in which they can encourage people tostart saving natural resources like water , or to convince people that power consumption can be reduced in many other ways .
Great Eats !
La Cacharrería is a small , Spanish restaurant in the old town of Cáceres .
It is a popular place .
The interior is simple .
The tables are small and tall but they are comfortable .
The atmosphere is friendly and relaxed .
There is a little courtyard with three tables .
La Cacharreriaes a tapas restaurant so you can choose lots of different , small dishes and share them .
I try something new each time I go there , but I often order the humus , I love it .
I also recommend the zucchini flower or the salads .
The food is always fresh .
the desserts are delicious and original .
The service at La Cacharreria is very good .
The Waiters are really helpful .
They are always happy to explain the different dishes and recommend well .
Another thing about this restaurant is that it is cheap , about 20E per person .
La Cacharrería has a disadvantage , you ca n't reserve a table and it is very popular .
I recommend La Cacharería , because it is a great place for a quiet meal with friends .
Hi Ryan ,
This is just a quick e - mail to apologise because I forgot to ask you if you want to come to celebrate the end of the year .

Sleeping to much is a relief , but for others it can be torture .
Different factors such as stress , psychological problems , noise , lights that do not let you rest .
" Sleep and Your Health " talks about this .
Mention 3 things we should do to sleep better and be healthy as well , which will discuss below .
The first step to better sleep is to recognize that maybe I can have a sleep disorder .
Taking me as an example , I do not think I have a sleep disorder .
I do not have trouble sleeping , or interrupt my sleep repeatedly .
I sure do not get enough sleep but not a sleep disorder , if not , the pace of life I lead .
The second step is to identify what I could cause the sleep disorder .
Even if you have a disorder , yes I can identify factors that may interrupt my sleep .
The reading speech of many , but with whom I identify most is caffeine before sleeping and eating heavy before bedtime .
I definitely need to pay attention to these factors and that way I can see improvement .
The third and final step is to try to identify problems at first .
It is very important to know how we can improve our health .
There are different medications or even natural things to improve these conditions .
Help and put into practice these tips will help us have a healthier life .
In summary , it is important to pay attention to our health .
Read things that can help us live better can be very helpful .
Implement each council and tell others about your improvements , is a good way to help others .
So for now we must sleep well to be healthier .
My favourite sport .
Let me tell you about my favorite sport .
I like many types of sports but I prefer swimming .
Swimming is my favourite sport .
I practise it every day in my school .
We have a swimming pool in our school and we swim from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. When I swim I feel very happy and relaxed .
The benefits of swimming are that your body is healthy and your brain is alert .
To practise this sport first you have to meet someone who teaches you how to swim because it is a beautiful sport but it is also dangerous .
You have to have a good coach and a good swimsuit .
If you try it you can do it .

Some people think there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
Cars actually have many advantages .
However , it does n't mean the public transport have to disappear .
The main reason to consider there is future for public transport is that , according to ecologists , we must cut down the massive use of cars .
The pollution level is more and more increased by this excessive use .
Then , the public transport is needed to avoid more problems in the atmosphere and save the planet .
What 's more , not only increases it the pollution , but also turns out to be dangerous for our sense of hearing .
In addition , I think the public transport is a necessary service which we should have access to .
Everyone ca n't afford a car or , for any reason , are n't able to drive one .
Therefore , it is too important to go on with a public transport business now and in the future .
In conclusion , from my point of view , people from all over the world would rather travel by car than travel by public transport but we 'd better use this means of transport if we want to continue living in accurate conditions .
Dear Mr .
Garo ,
Please find below clarification related to the below issue :
During a meeting with head of the department in MOH I was complaining about service of the microscope by their staffs ( almost 99.9%from Olympus Microscopes are not under Service Contract , and handling by Electronic W / S in M.O.H. ) and I suggested to provide the required training for his all staffs , in order to improve the quality of Olympus Microscopes service .
Next day I have received a call from one of the technician Mr. Humam Altannous ( who was compliant against us ) and asking to repair the Microscopes in Malariya Lab ( which are not under warranty or Contract ) .
I explained to him the standard protocol that it should be send a official repair request in order to proceed with repair the unit .
But he is not ready to accept it and asking us to come and repair the unit without any repair request issued . please note that our telephone conversation was only for 2 minutes and during this conversation he was misbehaving and mistreating me and hang - up the phone ) .
He was not asking any Manual / trouble shooting instruction during our call what he mentioned in his email .
Next day I was compliant against him with the Head of the department , during that time only I came to know that he is one of the technician who is taking care of repairs of the Microscopes in the department , and his Manager requested me to not repair any unit without official request , beside he will come back to me regarding my complaint against his employee .
Please note that we are keeping a good relation with our customers and always giving our good service as well .
We hope that above explanation is sufficiently clear and exhaustive .
Thanks for your kind understanding
Due to there will be an international festival for young people in our region , I have written that report in order to know the preferences of them and the trends which are on nowadays .
Firstly , I have asked about the music that is listened to and about their favourites styles and groups and the results showed us that they are n't similar compared to music they liked a few years ago .
In fact , they hardly ever can defined themselves such as pop fans , rockers , ...
In addition , plenty of girls who were interviewed told they could n't stand reggaeton music , however they used to want to listen to it in discos because they could dance .
In my opinion , young people do n't have musical culture and magnificent bands of music like Rolling Stone are going to have remaining in the oblivion .
Secondly , I debated with young people to television programmes that are watched currently .
Most people prefer to watch reality programmes where people have to live with unknown people in order to gossip about them .
However , the documetaries are being forgotten and only a twenty - six percent of them would like watching more interesting TV series like Lost .
Moreover , all of them choose watching TV against reading a book as first option .
Finally , I also talked about the clothes they usually wear .
It is said that you are that you are wearing but in this report , we can check that it is not certain .
Actually , in opposition to the music , young people feel that they can reveal their behaviour and their character by which the clothes are being worn .
Nowadays , all people use the Internet and application everywhere .
Moreover , it is very easy to make friends and communicated with somebody .
First of all , thanks to the internet you can meet or talk to people even if not by your site .
In addition , it 's easier to talk with someone that you do n't meet and you want it .
Furthermore , if you are a shy person , this way is very useful for you because you can talk more directly with someone .
Secondly , if you use the Internet to meeting new people , it 's a good way to finding people with similar interest . You can enter application and you can explain how you look like and someone is interested in you .
Finally , I think that thanks to the internet you can talk with someone who live in Japan , but often you stop talking with someone who is yours front .
In conclusion , I 'm agree that Internet it 's a good way to meeting friends because you can know a lot of people around the world .
The statement - ' There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient . ' can be discussed in two different aspects .
One way of using transport is to daily travel to work within the city , other way is to use it when you are visiting your friends or family outside the city .
There have been good progress in transport in both the aspects .
Transport has become faster and more convenient , and it can be attributed to lot of factors such as better roads , new technologies and innovations etc .
People who travel daily to work , usually prefer public transport over own car as it is a cheaper option .
Also , as public transport such as metro do not need to face traffic , it is always faster way to reach office .
On the other hand if I would be travelling to see my friends or family in nearby town or just on holiday tour , I would prefer my car .
If you are travelling in your car , it gives you flexibility to choose any way to reach your destination , you can make any number of stoppage , and even stop for your favorite ice cream .
In future ; environment will also become a key factor in determining the state of these transport mediums .
Countries today are trying to reduce their carbon footprints , they are trying to encourage public transport .
This initiative will surely help countries to reduce pollution .
I think education is one of the most important thing for everyone .
In my opinion , it is , probably , the base of the values of every society because our children from now will be the men or women of the future .
In Spain the vast mayority of schools are state schools .
This is the reason for the government decisions of education play an essential role . I have always thought that it should be reached for all .
I studied in a state school and I believe that I get a good education not only academic training but also strong principles to live in society .
The internet and social networks have involved a big change in our knowledge and behaviour front to the world .
From my point of view I feel like we are losing things so important as the effort to reach goals or respectful everyone .
Nowadays , we are living in a global world and we must learn how to live together therefore the education is the only way to achieve it .
For instance , knowing other languages , like English is increasingly day a day .
To sum up , education is , in my opinion , the most important base of any society and it should be reached whole people .
No doubt people need to move from a place to an other .
There are many reasons for travelling , and to travel from one place to an other people use different means .
there are variety of transport mean .
Some are private and some are public .
Public transport means such are trains , planes and buses are known as the most cheap and used by all travelers , and the coast of using them is something that suits the people who earn not so much money .
Where as the private means such as cars and small planes are known as the most expensive .
They cost too much to own them , and to run them .
Their fuel and kits are rather expensive .
The user of the transports mean are differ , the public ones are able to carry big number of travelers , where as the private means used by very little number of people .
This option may be applied on the cargo also .
because the public means of transport can carry a lot , and this help to move cargoes to every where with low coast .
All these points are support the importance of the public transport means , and ensure how useful they are .
In my view , the public transport will keep on offering their services , and will never be effected by the appearance of private means .
Introduction :
This report is intended to evaluate the Active Leisure Club and to give some suggestions to the Club 's new facilities .
Minuses :
The club 's cafeteria , locker rooms and bathrooms are too small for the number of members .
I believe that should be taken in mind when the new facilities are built .
Pluses :
The Club offers a wide range of activities to spend time .
Those activities developed my interest in sports and nature .
The staff must also be congratulated .
Everyone on the organisation was kind , helpful and cheerful .
Recommendations :
Although facilities are well organised , they are too small since more and more people are becoming members of the club .
However , the advantages overcome the worst aspects and I will be happy to join the club again next Summer .

I would like to share with you that my younger brother adores me , such as my other cousins whose ages remain as the required standard for going camping .
My expertise is to organise games for children , everybody enjoy the way I develop my strategy and they just ca n't resist the team 's rivalry during the games .
I am also a talented cooker for kids , my view is also trying to convince them that cooking is fun and sometimes they ask me to teach how to make basic dishes such as ommelettes , spaghetti and more .
My plan is to have fun and provide fun with my work for children , I consider myself very patient and I do care for children , in that order of ideas , I would like to apply for the job and if it 's possible , join your next camp in summer .
I appreciate your attention to this letter , do not hesitate to contact me in case you have any doubts
Sincerely ,
Gerard
Doing sports or just watching them ?
Nowadays there are many people who practise sports , but other people prefer just watching them .
On the one hand , doing sports allows you to have a healthier life .
Most doctors recommend doing this .
Doing sports is a good way to forget about real life , you focus on the competition and is like to have a rest from the cotidian life .
On the other hand , doing sports is healthy , despite the fact that there are risky sports that can cause several health problems and could lead you to death , only watching sports seems safer .
In conclusion , personally despite the danger of some sports , doing sports is by far better than just sit in your house and watching them .
Dear sir / madam ,
I 'm so glad to hear that you give me an opportunity to make your club facilities improvement .

The good points of the club are as below ,
1 . All the people who work in the club are attentive and professional
2 . The facilities are cheap to use
3 . The changing room is very clean
The bad points of the club are as below ,
1 .
The gym of your club is not open from 7:00 AM TO 8:00 AM

The temperature of the changing room is too low .
I would like to recommend that the gym opens 7:00 AM for the people who want to visit there little bit earlier and the heating changing room should be fixed .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you that my reply could be a great tip for your club this year .
yours sincerely ,
BTLee
The last film i saw was called " The others " altough is not a recent film .
The film is a horror movie which tells the story of a rich family who lived in an old mansion in an abandoned island after the second world war .
The problem about this mansion is that the same hides a lot of secrets and misteries which are going to be discovered by its temporary owners who are a family whose husband went to war and died so the real ocupants of the house are nicholas , an easily scared boy , his sister anne who turns to be one of the most important characters of the film and their mother who is called grace and has a particulary obsession for catholisism .
The other characters that also take an important part in the movie are the servants .
Bertha / mr.tuttle and the mute girl lidya who also hides a lot of secrets .
The film descrives how the love that a mother can give to her children can easlily turn into an obsession.however,what makes this film so special is that that pretends to be a typical horror movie but at its final scene there is a suddenly change wich turn it more interesting .
It was made in the right place for such an unexpected film as it was made in a big manor on an abandoned foggy island .
I would recomend this film to anyone , even those who are easily scared scared because it is not as the resto of horror movies , it is a film in which you are continuely discovering secrets as if you where another character .
You will have a great time
Public transport was developed for people who were poor and could not afford their own transport .
Public transport is the vehicle for passenger who can travel from one place to another in less money .
At first this transport was appreciated marvelously .
Everyone felt so delighted but unfortunately now people feels uncomfortable when it comes to travel via public transport .
In early days of public transport , people were only stick to their normal routine and did not wish to earn more from their job or work .
Today every single person is curious to earn money as much as they can and the interesting part is that this curiosity is increasing day by day so is their income .
So now almost 80 percent people can afford their own transport .
As people feel comfortable in there own vehicle .
The main advantage of having your own transport is that you do not have to wait for the public transport , you can save your time as you only need to accelerate your own transport and drive to your destination .
Public Transport is slow now , even though they are very comfortable but unfortunately people feel public transport is for poor people and if any middle class or upper class would travel through public transport it would affect his respect .
But still there are so many people who use public transport frequently but that is only their compulsion and poverty .
When they would be financially stable they would surely buy their own vehicle .
So in my opinion I agree with the statement that there is no future of public transport .
It is a well known fact that transport is quite related with pollution .
The exhumed fumes are one of the great problems for the environment .
So that it is a cuestion that required a deeper reflexion for all of us .
Wheter public transport might be the solution , or be more adeccuate or not , it is something with arguments in favour and against .
Firstly , many people think public transport has not future because travelling by car is faster and more independent .
You do not to wait for a specific time to cath the bus , for example .
Secondly , people think buying a car is a cheaper option in long term than travelling by public transport every day .
However , a lot of people are becaming more and more consciencious about how important travelling by public transport is .
One of the most important reasons is precisily to take care of the environment .
Using public transport reduce the pollution .
What is more , when we speak about pollution we are not only talking about exhumes fumes .
We also speak about noise .
I am very happy with the idea to encourage the public transport 's use due to make the cities a better place to live .
If everyone travelled by bus , cities would be a quite different the ones we know now .
Dear Paul ,
To tell you the truth about the concert , I did n't think that it would be cool but it was !
I really liked to work with special effects and the best thing that I learnt a lot about that tehnology .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you !
Best wishes ,

Public transportation is the most popular method in travelling to places .
These transportation can be easily found anywhere to reach your destination .
On the other hand , travelling by car is more convenient and safe .
Travelling by car is preferred by some people because of its convenience and advantages .
For example , air bags have been tested to ensure the safety of the passenger and the driver .
In addition to this , we would not take too much time in looking for a bus which would go specifically to our destination .
But we can not deny the fact that public transportation has been around in years and in every country as a means of travel .
Most of the people prefer this kind of transport , especially those who can not afford to buy a car .
Also , this is the cheapest way to get to your preferred location .
I disagree that there is no future for public transportation as it is still widely used all over the world .
Moreover , this has helped a lot of people especially those who can not afford to buy a car .
However , public transportation in the future might be improved and developed and will still be used by many people .
The side effect of depending only on cars as the main transportation are remarkable .
we should encourage public transportation all we can because every city now has huge number of cars run on it 's streets and this number is going up speedy .having this huge increasing of cars that will impact badly in public health & environment and infrastructure .
It is more convenient with modern lifestyle to travel with a car because of the privacy and independently.the remarkable development of car 's luxury and more option .
although it will be over cost in full , car service and effort of concentration on driving all of this negativity you can avoid it easily by using public transportation , it should be cheaper than using your own car you do not have to look after it you can do activities wail you are on it like reading or chatting with your friends or having important phone call
The environment impact is an important factor we should consider , having this number of cars like having thousands of factories in our streets giving us tans of CO2 gas and many other pollution gases.the speed new train or plans or even buses now competing withe car 's speed and even more fast than it in a lot of places .
Using public transportation is better than use individual cars , but we should put more attractive things inside it and should have new designs and more privacy and luxury means , expanding in electric car and other clean energy is very important right now to reduce environment 's pollution as far as we can .
Hi !
How are you ?
Thanks so much for your last letter .
I have never forgotten that funny story about baseball match .
It was so impressive .
Sport is really important .
Hope my thoughts will be interesting for you .
As for my personal experience of sports , I do n't do it professionally .
My future job wo n't be connected with it .
So sport is my hobby , a nice method of having a rest , spending some new unusual life .
Most of all I enjoy playing volleyball and badminton .
There was a such time when I was visiting volleyball club , but I gave it up .
I do n't know why exactly .
Maybe I had n't enough time .
Badminton is what I consider to be favorite .
It 's easy , interesting and funny .
You can train your hands , reaction and legs , because it needs much run .
Usually I do this kind of sports with my sister .
We have a great time .
Moreover , I like to do different physical exercises every morning .
It makes my day more productive .
When it 's a good weather , I enjoy jogging near the house .
How could I forget about cycling ?
To my mind , bike is the best way of traveling .
It 's also useful for cardiovascular system .
I 'm absolutely convinced , everyone should realize that the most important is health and sport really can help .
If you want to keep your body in a good form , you ought to go in for it .
If your figure is nice , you will have a nice mood , wonderful feelings .
So it 's better to choose sport instead computer in order to relax , feel positive emotions .
The Home of the Future
Having lived during the century , which provided humanity with glass houses , question ponders , how will the home of the Future look ?
Predictable , some of the solutions will remain intact .
Any changes would mean a resignation of comfort .
House is to be divided between chambers in order to preserve the privacy of the occupants .
Pieces of furniture , namely chair , table and bed , would remain unchanged .
Nonetheless , the changes will be visible on the interior as well as the exterior .
Buildings will become smaller , yet more functional and organised .
Furthermore , they will be ecological , the main reason using renewable sources of energy .
As a matter of fact , reduction of living space will not be noticeable due to thinner walls .
The windows are bound to be broader .
The electronics will undergo the most evident changes .
The screen will be no longer required for the computers and TV .
All electronic devices will be controlled by the voice thoughts .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am writing this letter because I am concerned about facilities for shoppers in our area .
First of all , I have to admit I am addicted to shopping and I really like that there is such an extensive shopping area in our town .
I appreciate also that it is located near to the housing estate .
Unfortunately , I think there are some aspects that demand improvements .
In my opinion parking charges are too high .
Furthermore , the shopping area lacks restaurants and entertainment facilities .
People usually become hungry after shopping , so opening eating places in this area would be very beneficial .
In addition , the shops arrangement is actually very messy and finding the store I need is hard .
I would like to propose some solutions , as well .
The parking should be free of charges , it would attract more people and increase the income overall .
Moreover , you should change the arrangement of shops and divide the whole area to certain sections ( e.g. clothes , food , and house ) .
Finally , opening restaurants with different types of food and entertainment facilities like movie theatres and gyms should be considered .
Yours faithfully ,
XYZ
My favourite sport is undoubtedly jogging .
I am very lucky because not far from my home there are three parks so I can practise this sport whenever I want .
Usually I jog three days a week and , honestly , I could n't do without !
Running in contact with nature allows me to relax after work and recharge my energies .
Once finished my training , I go home , take a shower and ... I feel like a new woman ! !
My advice for those people who want to take up this sport is to start gradually .
They can begin to jog for 15 minutes and then increasing the time so that their body can get used to the muscular effort .
Furthermore , it would be useful having a chronometer to check out your improvement .
I would also recommend to stretch after every work out to avoid any kind of muscular pain .
If you prefer , you can substitute stretching with few yoga exercises as well .
Good jogging ! !
Among young people exist a statement that shopping is always an enjoyable way to spend your free time .
Personally I am not completely agree with this way of thinking .
On the one hand , if you have money and a lot of free time you can spend all day dodging in the mall for only one , special kind of skirt or pair of jeans .
But if you do not have money , prices can only destroy your day because you know that you can not afford it .
The prices in the shops often are very high and clothes are not good qualitatively .
And when you want to buy something in lower price , you need to go to the mall when there are seasonal sales .
But then everybody goes crazy , you need to crowd through the mob , argue with another person for one , special pair of shoes in your size .
For me it is only a torture .
Also you can be robbed because in crowded places you can easily fall prey to pickpockets .
Otherwise you need to have time to walk through all the shops and find what you need , every thing on the rack is calling for your attention , after a while you want to buy everything .
On the other hand if you find a real bargain and buy something in very low price , you will be happy and content for the rest of the day .
But in my case , it happen rarely .
Some people do not want to buy things by network because they want to try on for example clothes .
For me it is not necessary because every seller gives the size of his product and then I can check if this thing will be good for me or not .
Also you can always return it like in the stationery stores .
Summing I prefer doing my shopping by means of websides or auction portals .
There I can easily find what interests me , what is in my size etc .
For me it is easier and faster way to buy what I want , often in better price .
The diagrams illustrates the process of making bank notes .
The first step is design which includes background colour , artwork and security issues .
Then move to the next step , preparation of metal plates , while skilled machinists is needed in this process .
Printing is quite related to the first two steps because the design and skilled machinists should both be considered .
And when the sheets of bank notes are being printed , colour on both sides , special ink and slightly raise image should on the bank note .
The most important step is inspection , where printed sheets should be inspected manually and carefully .
It divides sheet of bank notes into three types , which are good quality sheets , partially damaged sheets or bank notes separated into good and bad and bad sheets .
However , there is a big difference between these three types .
If the quality of sheets and bank notes are good , then they will be packaged and distributed .
Conversely , bad sheets and bank notes will be destroyed .

There are so many options on television that sometimes it 's hard to make up your mind , do n't you think ?
You can watch reality shows , cartoons and wherever you want .
You can see international channels and live shows around the world , something that in the past could be too good to be true .
On the other hand , when we think about the currently program 's style , even those shown on paid tv , it seems that nothing has changed .
they keep producing the same kind of programs , the same kind of movies and soap operas .
Moreover the repeating is massive , I bet that at least once a week you can find that old series called friends , ca n't you ?
Even knowing that not too much has changed our options nowadays still make the television a very good tool to get a family together and spend an enjoyable time .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with your service I received when I spent a night at your hotel on 20th March 2014 .
Firstly , I must inform you that I am dissatisfied with the hotel receptionist because he forgot to place my wake - up call and as a result I overslept and I missed my flight .
I had to buy a ticket for the next flight .
Furthermore , I was late for a very important appointment and I lost a lot of money .
I would recommend you to improve your standard and quality of service and to draw your attention to the stuff in your reception .
I believe you give this matter your urgent attention .
I feel that you should refund my cost of staying at your hotel and I demand refunding the cost of another plane ticket I had to buy .
I look forward to receiving your reply or I will be forced to take a legal action .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am writing to inform you about one of the most interesting place in our town .
There is a lot outstanding views and worth visiting places but let me tell you about the Warriors Museum .
The Warriors Museum is the best known museum in the region .
It looks like a castle and there are many rooms with archery from IX to XX .
The torture room is very popular with children but eager fans can also find something suiting them .
Guides are helpful and brainy - you can ask them any questions and they will answer .
The breathing landscapes you can see from a museum are also a great advantage .
The museum is located near the center of city , you can get there by bus in 5 minutes or go for a walk for about 15 minutes .
Tickets cost 15 zlotys for students and 20 zlotys for adults .
I hope I was helpful . I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
XYZ
My name is Arturo Archuleta , I 'm from Mexico and I 'd like to talk about my favorite sport , " Muay Thai " .
The first time practicing Muay Thai was 5 years ago , at that time I was n't sure of practicing it because I did n't consider myself strong enough for fighting , that 's what most of the young people think , at least in Mexico and some other countries , and that 's one reason why people do n't practise Muay Thai and is not known .
Well , you should know that bodily strength is very important in this kind of sports but is not the most important thing , mental strength is also important ; a mix of both strengths are necessary , remember the body does what the mind commands .
Was hard at the beginning just like when you start doing something new , so here are some tips if you want to start practicing Muay Thai .
Be confident
When you practise any sport , you have to be confident on yourself , without confidence you will not have any progress .
Work on it , that 's part of mental strength .
Warm - up
Before starting the practice you should warm up , you do n't want to cramp up , right ?
Never give up
Muay Thai is a complete sport , you use arms , legs , elbows , knees , feet and more , that means you have to do a big effort .
If you do n't know how to kick or blow , ask your shifu ( teacher ) and keep doing it until you get it .
Practice
Practice makes better , do research about Muai Thai 's culture , do research about Muai Thai 's methods .
All this will help you to improve .
Enjoy
You know you like a sport when you enjoy it and you feel comfortable to practise , that 's what I recommend do , enjoy and be happy practicing because Muay Thai is a beautiful sport !
I am economics student in National Chung Cheng University , which is placed in Taiwan .

Mike was one of the best awardees in the class .
He 's been doing great in both academic and extra curicular activities in the school .
He is one of the players of basketball since he was an elementary student until now he 's on college .
As the tournament began he 's been getting a high points for his team because of that nice contribution they have won the game .
It had been a very extensive and tiring day to all of them but Mike felt he had achieved something really good because fortunately he was won as the most valuable player too .
He 's not only doing excellently as a student however he 's been known as one of the popular students because he works voluntarily as a couch to the younger kids in his town .
He wants other kids to be inspired also in everything they are capable of doing .
So in their generation they have something good that they contribute in the society at their very young age .
For him , it 's absolutely right to begin doing something meaningful in their lives .
It might be a simple way but perhaps the society would be proud on what are they doing .
As we all know , youth is the hope of our society and they have proven that .
the mistake is something you may do unintentionally however , people believe that mistakes can later be improved or ignored whereas , sometimes we may make mistakes that could break somebody 's heart .
Michael was a teenager therefore was not mature as a an adult thus his decision were all emotional .
it was Christmas eve and a new girl came to the college .
Who was not only fair but very attractive girl .
As soon as she entered the college gate everybody was smitten by her .
Michael had a very good and an old friend who had been with him in his goods and worse .
And they both had a great understanding however , this innocent girl had grabbed the attention of all the viewers similarly , the two .
The girl liked Michael 's friend Henry .
Michael could not digest this fact since he could not compromise on anything .
Michael thought of a dirty game he called , Henry at a birthday party and took him on the terrace and pushed him down .
Henry kept on shouting to stop and not to betray his oldest of the friend . "
do not do such a thing that would make you regret later"Henry said .
Henry fell down and his head was injured Michael left him to bled profusely and later a pedestrian saw his body tried to look at his pulse rate but encountered that he was dead .
Later the girl discovered that Michael was all behind the incident .
After the inquiry Michael was put behind the bars and the girl went away .
And Michael just had the regret all the way later
Have you ever thought about what your life would be in the next 50 years ?
If you are quite young , you can expect to be alive in 2064 .
If you are old enough , you can see how far the technology has gone in the last 20 years .
It 's quite amusing to try figuring out what the life in the future could be .
First of all , oil should be overcome as a source of energy .
Provided that renewable sources will be developed enough , we could live without pollution .
Secondly , we can expect to live in a hi - tech house , with smart furniture .
And there could also be robots , why not ?
They could cook for us , drive our cars , wash our dishes , take care of our children and so on .
Medicine should have won a lot of diseases and maybe it could be ready to overcome aging .
On the one hand we could live in a more relaxed way , on the other hand we colud think about settling on other planets .
Would you like to live on the Moon ?
Can you imagine a holiday on Mars ?
Finally , you can think it will be a green , peaceful enjoyable world .
The members of my family are my best friends .
Why do I think so ?
I 'll try to explain .
There is no secret , that everybody needs at least one person to share his troubles or happiness with .
As a rule , a friend or psychologist play this role .
We must pay to receive the psychologist 's attention , but friendship is free of charge .
Every day for we are looking for friends .
It 's a way to deal with external world .
But what if nobody wants to talk to you ?
What if you 're alone and no one can understand you ( and you have no money and insurance to visit psychologist ) ?
You return home .
There you can cure your sick heart .
Your parents always maintain and defend you , they are happy just to see you - their child , the result of their love .
They treat you for who you are and know all your faults , but still love you .
My parents are my best friends because I can trust them , love them and look forward our meeting .
Thank your parents if they are alive and think if you would become a good friend to your future child .
THE LUCKIEST MAN IN CÁCERES
The luckiest man that you can know in Cáceres is called Sergio .
He is still in his twenties and he has studied computer engineering .
Until now all is normal in his life .
However , when Sergio finished his studies he was hired by Microsoft in United States .
He had everything that any person would want to have : live abroad , earn much money , have a partner , work in an international business , an so on .
Despite this , one day Sergio realised that what he was doing was not his true dream .
He did not want to earn much money , what he truly wanted was to earn enough money to travel around the world , and not a job which does not allow to do his hobbies , although it gives him a lot of money .
Then Sergio left Mycrosoft , created his own website which gave him enough money and travelled wherever he want .
Now he is a famous person on internet because of his blog : ' Live to the fullest ' .
From : Rafa
To : Alex
Subject :
Sorry that I haven't written before but my mother had been using the computer all the time for work and I had to wait until she finished her work .
First , I think that 's a fantastic idea go to the new activity centre . We 'll enjoy a lot and meet new places .
Sounds perfect for me !
As you asked me , I rather sailing on the river than climbling a wall because I want to connect with nature .
If we have extra time we can do the other activity whether you want .
At night , we can stay at home , as you said , and also we can buy chocolates and see a movie , that 's great for me !
But you can tell me other option when to go to your home .
Finally , I 'm afraid my parents ca n't take me to your home on Friday evening , because it 's my grandfather 's birthday .
The population grows , with more business skyscrapers , residential houses and advanced transportations , at the cost of diminishing farmland , wetland as well as deforestation .
Though the modern cities emerging repaidly , the problems caused by excessively exploiting the enviorment are severly various .
It is clear that habitats for all kinds of wildlife are vanishing as the bio - diversity decreases .
The red coral reef off coast in Austrialia , for instance , serve as shelter for algea and other sea tiny fishes and index of enviroment fragility .
Due to the massive construction of five - star hotels on beaches , the biological chain there are cut off and enviromental variations are gone away .
On top of that , It is the regulation capacities of enviorment that for temperature , moisture and even the sandstorms are erode as less plants engage inhale carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen the whole system .
What 's more , extreme weather appears with EL NINO periodically causing catastrophic floods in northern cities in China and long - lasting drought in South American .
For the population density is ever - increasing currently , the loss triggered by these disasters are damaging and unaffordable for any single family .
In a response to address these side affects that the civilization bring about , governments must take measures stey by step to tackle them .
Firstly , governing authorities should set up protect area for animals and plants , inhibitating hunting or even leisure activities like hiking .
Apart from the natural areas , the minimual areas for forests and wetland have to be ensured .
Secondly , government must fund environmental organizations , in order to manipulate and coordinate more power to stop the illegal hunting , deforesting and animal extinctions .
Furthermore , the government should go out of their ways stand united in a way which joint endeavours could be effective globally .
In conclusion , government are supposed to balance the modernization and sustainable development .
Hello Paula
I want to tell you about the concert in my school , it was really cool .
We prepared it for a long time , but I had wonderful experience .
I learned to decorate the stage and sew costumes .
My friend Make showed me how best to play the role of snow White , it was very funny .
We had hard days also , we argued , but then quickly put up .
During the concert one boy forgot the text and began to improvise .
All the audience began to laugh .
The concert was very good .
The course is going to finish so the teacher want that we go out to a restaurant .
The choice was n't easy because the teacher is vegetarian .
At last we decided to go to a restaurant near the school .
The owners cook all types of cuisine and we can go there after the lesson .
The atmosphere is kind and familiar .
The prices are not expensive and foods are very good .
There are not many tables , but we are only seven people and this is n't a problem .
There is also a garden outdoor where we can spend a pleasant time together after lunch .
We will go there next Monday .
I have booked a table for eight people because our boss will come too .
We will eat a legume soup as start , a boiled fish with green salad as main course and a dessert at the end .
I have just fixed the price per person .
We are going to pay 15 euros per person .
I think it will be a wonderful way to finish our English course where we have surely improved in writing , speaking and listening .
Therefore I want to say a special thanksgiving to our teacher .
In my area , young people have a lot of options .
I see most of them like to stay at the garden downtown during the afternoon when the weather is good .
If the weather is n't good enough they can find a lot of cafes opened from morning until late night and here , if they are old enough they can also order alcholics .
There are many kinds of cafes , the ones for those who like sports , art , literature or music .
At the " Soft Notes " you can ear music played live every Friday and Sunday evening .
A lot of kids like to join the park next to the church : it 's not related to religion , here every child is free to come and play .
In this place there are guys and girls attending pedagogy organize activities to entratain children of every age .
The most rated restaurant is " Mario 's Pizza " , where you can eat delicious pizza with the top you prefer .
While waiting for it , you can play with video games placed in the basement .
Nowadays the type of transport that you use is a concerning matter of discussion .
Public transport include buses , trains , and subway , however cars , bicycles , taxis are not forgotten .
In the moment of choosing , very different aspects like ecological effects , the economic viability and even time uses , take part on the decision .
Firstly , the car option is the best one in comfort , because you do not depend on a specific time to travel and modern cars have the best technology in equipment and facilities .
Then public transport is not as comfortable as the previous one , because luckily you can find a place to sit and forget it if it is in the rush hour .
By the other hand , traffic is the biggest trouble talking about transport , cars facilities are replaced by the need of punctuality and , depending on the city , the delays are a concerning point when we talk about travelling by bus or trains .
However , the economic aspect is very important to consider when we talk about convenience , cars are the most expensive ones .
Not only because of the oil'prices , but also the costs of enssurance , the car , the parking taxes , etc .
In comparisson with a bus ticket that costs four pesos and you are sure that sooner or later it will come .
To sum - up , neither cars nor public transport is considered the perfect option , but considering long term consequences as is nowadays common in some European countries , bicycles are the best way .
Riding a bicycle reduces traffic , costs , ecological impact , and even car crushes .
So , what are you waiting to buy a bicycle and put a helmet on ?
Dear Jane ,
it 's so kind of you to send me my favourite Glaswegian postcards !
Say hello to Anne on my behalf and tell her I ca n't wait to have you both here in Rome !
Well , to start with , I 'd like to attend an intensive English course ; you know I 'm fond of foreign languages and keen on learning English as much as I can .
I 'd fancy living in a family and not in a college or in a shared flat as it will give me the opportunity to be continuously in touch with English people , day and night ; then , it is the ideal solution for me : you know I 've been recently given the sack !
What about lookig for colleges which offer Wi - fi Internet connection and a proper meal at lunch ?
I 'm a greedy guts !
Looking forward to receiving your new letter , and on tenterhooks for the information you 'll provide .

Fashion , clothes style , trendy appearance , make - up properly , the hear ...
Many people think that the first impression we give and our appearance are very important in our life ; but , it should be like this ?
It is certainly true that people are very critic with the appearance .
We have subjetive opinions ; we normally judge because we have a preconception idea .
We match clothes stile with a lifestyle and a personality .
That is why appearance should not have consequences in our lives .
Most people would agree that fashion is something that takes part in our day to day .
Normally , people choose clothes that famous wear or appear in the magazines .
However , there are people who do not follow that , and they dress the most comfortable clothes for them or the style they like most .
I think that there are many different occasions , and each one requires a different type of clothes .
For example , in work interwies and work that have a direct contact with the public it is better to use a for or smart style .
And same happened with parties , festivals , sports and other events .
Overall , my personal opinión is that we give so much importance to the clothes and the appearance than it should be .
Although in some occasions some clothes styles are required , people should have freedom to choose what clothesdo they want to wear , and it should not have consequences in our life .
The death of the public transportation
People do not think about the environment , they only think about the time that they will spend on the traffic . the scientists said the new society it can be called " the fat society " because the the people do not want to do any exercise , people do not walk anymore , people just use elevators , etc .
a lot of commodities , this is ta reason of why there are not future for public transportation , people do not wanna spend few time walking to the bus station or tu get a cab , although the service in the public transportation it is not very good because of many things like the inflation of prices , the way that the bus or cab driver refers to the persons , the way of the bus or cab drivers drives , etc .
In cities like Mexico some people have the opportunity to use Uber , that is a service that you can use if you have a credit card , it is an amazing service , but not all the population have car or the economic status to use an uber , so people have to use public transportation , no matter if the buss or cab driver yell them or drive bad , in Mexico the public transportation in specific the cabs are not a very secure service , because some of the drivers still and kindnap , in may situation they can kill you if you do not have your precautions . but despite of this is very sad that in that place people can not do some thing because they do not have the possibilities to pay for something more so they have to took .
In cities like United Sates of America where people have the opportunity to have a car or a privileged social condition so for the American people public transportation it does not matter , they have the possibility to take public transportation or not , they can decide , so they decided for commodity .
The future of the public transportation can be death or can be in growth , it depends on were do you position your point of view , in Mexico maybe will never die , but in the United States the public transportation is now in agony .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .
She woke up and at once she felt something makes her happy .
She went to the kitchen and saw a beautifully prepared breakfast .
She wondered who could make such a pleasant surprise .
Suddenly , she remembered that for three days she living with Chuck - her boyfriend .

Book Review :
The Hunger Games
I just read the first book in a trilogy called The Hunger Games .
It is an action and thriller book written by Suzanne Collins .
When I started reading I could not put it down because it is a fascinating story that grabs you .
The story takes place in a country called Panem which is located in what was once known as North America .
Katniss the protagonist is a teenage girl 16 which is forced to poach to feed his family since his father died
An increasing number of people begin to discuss for the success in school or work , the having an ability to adapt or adjust conditions or circumstances is more important than having excellent knowledge or a field of study .
Many people air their opinions based on their own value system .
The majority of people tend to claim that having an excellent knowledge or the research field is the most important for school or work successfully .
However does the claim really ring true , conforming the real situation ?
I find myself not on the same wavelength with such an idea .
It is my contention that the people , who have the ability to adapt or adjust conditions or circumstances have higher percentage be successful in school or work .
As far as I concern , there are a bunch of reasons to support me perspective .
To begin with , acquiring the knowledge in today 's world is not a difficult things than it was in the past .
That is to say , the investment of the internet make it available for everyone in the world .
People can easily obtain the lasted knowledge by owning a computer that can access to the network and have the ability to reading .
In other words , the way to get the knowledge is equal to everyone in the world .
That is why it is not to be the key point that considered the key to success .
In addition , the education has already across the wealth gap .
To explain , there are a trend that many universities all over the world setting up the freely courses for the people who thirsty for knowledge , also often invited the famous scholar to give a speech to the public that is welcome for everyone .
People in modern society have a lot of resources to further research the field of study that they are interesting in .
Thus , everyone might be an expert .
Excellent performance in the field of study has not been determined of factors for your success .
A case in point would be the latest news broadcasted recently .
According to the investigation conducted by the 104 human resource bank , the percentage of people using the knowledge in the work field that they from school has surprising reduced in the last two decades by roughly thirty percent , a figure that has nearly one half compared to that of half - century .
Say it simply , the things that school teach us were no longer be used in the real world .
This phenomenon had been curiously many experts .
Does the knowledge from school have any different in the work field ?
However , after deeper analysis , we found that the very underlying contributing factor lies in the fast pace changing world and the text book can not catch up with it , knowledge is changing from time to time .
Hence , this research remained us that the ability to adapt or adjust to changing conditions or circumstances is the major factor to success instead of having excellent knowledge or a field of study .
In sum , there may be some people who may disagree with my position on this matter .
They may say that having excellent knowledge or a field of study is the way to success in school or work .
However , I think the reasons I have provided in favor of my view point are stronger .
In this essay , I will discuss whether older or younger parents are better .
Nowadays , the statistics show that many people are younger than generations before .
I think there are more younger parents because they do not live in a religious life which is far more stricter .
Previously , the most women used to get a baby after the wedding with their partners , but today , it is not so important anymore .
Every child wishes to have young parents , but is it really better ?
Actually the teenagers are right because younger parents have a stronger relationship with their children .
Apart from this the small difference between the ages is also an advantage .
Although less experience is owned , they recognize what a child wants to do .
On the other hand a disadvantage is that young parents are not able to protect their babies without having experience on that .
In my age young parents and I have in common that we go out in the evenings .
From my point of view older parents can give better advice in every difficult situation .
So the child grows up from a teenager to a middle - aged adult and can always looks up to the parents .
However the progress in adolescence is important for the next stage of life so I believe both are good at bring up their children .
To conclude , you can not change your parents anyway .
It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
Tom had faith this day will be better than the others .
He did n't recover yet from the last scare he had that day .
He sat on his chair and looked to the window .
" ..... " he looked to his hands .
He was shaking .
He shook his head and looked to the ceiling .
He started to make his homework , but he had trouble concentrating as the memories came back to his mind .
" I can't ... do it " he slammed his head on the desk .
" I ca n't "
He looked to the bathroom door and walked to it .
He turned the lights on to see his face .
The same face as ever .
When he looked down the bathroom he saw something on the floor .
It was a note .
" Tom . Tom . Tom . Tom " it said .
That scared him .
It could n't be him again ...
He turned the note to see something
" 1992 - 2015 "
He felt it again .
The same feeling he had when he saw it .
He fell backwards and when he looked up , he saw it again .
" Tom . You are impolite .
You are late to your death date "
Everybody has got some ideas , how to live their own life .
It is very important to think about possibilities that should create your fortune .
There are two things that most impinge my life .
First , it is my family that helps me to make a good decision . I live with my husband more than ten years , so we know each other quite well to support the other one .
A big family is a great base for happy living together under one roof , but secrets are strongly forbidden .
If somebody in my family ask me to help I need to know the whole true without any potential lies .
That is why I learn my children to play fair .
On the other hand there is one other most important thing in my life- health .
I am more than happy that I am healthy and my family members are healthy as well , because health is the rarest thing in the world .
There is only one thing in the world that you can not buy and it is a health .
It is well known true through the whole men that health is fair to the rich and poor equally .
In conclusion I have to think about one thing , which is more important in my life that the other one .
I will always choose the health , because when a person is healthy he or she can do everything .
There are some solutions to prevent the rise in the consumption of sugar sweetened drinks .
The first solution is change portion size of soft drinks , which means smaller size of beverages could contain less sugar .
National Nutrition Survey(1995 ) points out that the most consumption of beverages for a teenager per day is sugar sweetened soft drinks .
Therefore , changing portion size of soft drinks would be efficient to reduce sugar intake for teenagers each time .
The limitation of this solution is the public may not satisfied with this size of soft drinks .
To overcome it , the producer of soft drinks could take a investment to teenagers what size is suitable before changing it .
This would help the teenagers who drink soft beverage decrease sugar intake efficiently .
Another solution to this problem would be education .
Family education would be introduced to their kids .
National Nutrition Survey(1995 ) reports that teenagers are main soft drinks consumers and the most consumption of beverage is sugar sweetened drinks .
Parents ' words is key to restrict their kids ' actions .
If parents educate their children to keep away from soft drinks or cultivate the awareness of drinking water .
They would not consume such amount of beverages .
However , children my get soft drinks outside the family .
That requires parents building a model to show positive effect without soft drinks .
Therefore , their kids would follow parents ' habits and behaviors .
In conclusion , increasing the consumption of soft drinks is one of issues to prevent from obesity and overweight .
A number of strategies could be efficient to address these problems .
Teenagers are main target who drink too many soft drinks .
So that parents education and changing portion size could be useful to address the problems which happens around teenagers .
If we take these measures within a short period and keep it for a long time , obesity and overweight problem would not happen in our next generations .
We can say that the Coyle 's idea is well developed thanks to two features that pass through the chapter and likely the entire book : first of all , many significant references and specialized people are mentioned to define what " deep practice " is ( a psychologist , some experts in their own field , authors who already analyzed that particular topic … ) ; secondly , but no less important , Coyle himself collected the most of his information while visiting at least nine places , nine " hotbeds " ( 12 ) where talents grow , as a sort of collection of data gathered from laboratory experiments .
As a consequence , theory and examples proceed together in a such natural way , that the reader must exclaim undoubtedly , as if she / he were before a Sherlock Homes ' investigation : « That 's it !
It has to be that way !
Coyle 's right ! »
In my days friendship was easily made with neighbours , schoolmates and social clubs friends .
Although we did not have the current social communication means such as Facebook , Twitter , Whatsapp , we were very sincere and close to each other more than these virtual frienships prevailing today .
I already exprienced one friendship through an organization , International Youth Service IYS , a benficiary association established for youth friendship .
In which we have to wait more than thirty days to send and receive one message that interchanges these days with one button press .
I have a personal experiment backs to 1987 , in this year I had started a pen friendship with a German girl called Claudia who was 17 years old then .
The surprise is today I am 44 years old and Claudia is 40 years old and we still correspond to each other through the modern means of Facebook and Whatsapp , of course , we no longer can wait for thirty days while we can chat and see each other live .
In my country I have two sincere friends since we were about 7 years old and we still in a strong friendship up till now .
It is not necessary to agree with each other in everything where we always debate and challenge whose opinion is correct .
Meanwhile , we support each other in crises , regular life troubles and sickness .
Real friendships everlasted like what I am actually made with my best two friends , should be founded on trust and faith .
The best of all in real frienships is to always believe in your friend 's abilities and be his real mirror for good and bad actions , he will be the same to you .
Skate or Hate
As I am in my late 20s I 've found it hard to find a sports activity that would neither be so competitive as those in fashion in my country nor demanding , so I could do it in my free time .
One fine summer day I was walking along the streets of a coastal city when all of a sudden I came across a shop that caught my eye .
In one of the windows I found a skateboard and along came the memories of the year 2000 and MTV channel that I was brought up into .
I thought to myself that could be a challenge and , with no second thoughts , I purchased the board .
It was since that day that I try to skate as much as possible and I love every bit of it .
It is funny how such a simple activity can bring so much joy into a person 's mind during the well - deserved breaks .
I suggest playing safe and being patient .
No future for public transport ?
Can use of your own car instead of a public transport save you money , time and effort ?
The most people prefer a car rather than a public transport .
However the latest studies shows a car is not always more efficient .
The right choice of means of transport makes a big impact on your time and resources .
In deciding whether to choose car or public transport we need to consider many factors , such as length of journey , time of the day we travel , area we travel through , number of us , weather etc .
As there are cases where car is much more efficient than public transport and other way round .
The recent studies found , that travelling from a suburb to the city centre is much more efficient by combining a bike with a train .
It saves plenty of time by avoiding traffic jams and there is no need for searching for a parking space .
In addition travelling by train saves a great deal of money as there is no parking fee .
Moreover there are discounts for regular journeys .
On the other hand , the studies showed , in many other cases and especially in irregular trips there is more convenient to use a car .
A car is unbeatable for its flexibility .
It is much more easy to use a car when going shopping , or making a leisure or an occasional trips .
Although , there are some disadvantages of using a car such as traffic jams and a high maintenance cost .
All in all , in most cases using your own car can save you money , time and effort .
Popularity of cars confirms it .
In spite of that , studies said there are cases in which public transport is unbeatable .
Therefore it has a safe place in our society .
The use of public transport has become an important issue nowadays .
There are those who try to avoid the use of public transport and prefer driving their own car due to the advantages it offers .
However there are those who reject this and are in favour of the use of public transport .
I am going to explain why I think there is not future for the public transport .
A great amount of people think that driving your own car has more benefits than using public transport .
Firstly , it allows you to go directly somewhere without finding out the information about the timetables of public transport such as buses or trains .
In addition , sometimes you have to combine both of them in order to arrive on time to your work place .
Another benefit of not using public transport is the time you can save .
For instance , if you have to go another city by bus or train to your workplace , the time you waste since you set off increases .
Saving time in the mornings allows you to sleep more or to spend more time with your family .
Moreover , the use of your own car has more advantages . Travelling by car avoids getting wet when the weather is rainy .
If you travelled by bus or train , probably you would spend more time walking along the streets to your final destination .
Despite the bad weather , if you travellled by car , you could park your car near your destination , so that you could arrive comfortably .
However , there is some people who prefer the use of public transport in spite of using the car .
The government usually advise the population to use public transport to cut down pollution and the amount of gases which damage the atmosphere .
In addition , it is often claimed that is cheaper than travelling by car .
Although it has some benefits , in most part of the country , especially in the smallest towns the public transport is not enough developed .
To sum up , I believe that the public transport has no future because it makes you to waste a lot of time , it is not enough developed in small areas and there is not enough frequency of trains and buses .
In my opinion it could be useful hardly ever times , so it would be necessary a great amount of improvements .
.H. Lawrence 's saying " Nobody ought to own houses or furniture - any more than they own the stones of the high road " is an ambiguous saying that questions the need of the people regarding a high number of properties .
First of all , to a certain degree , I comply with the idea of controlling the maximum number of properties one holds in his grasp , because this denies the possibility of exhausting the spaces that can hold another family .
This speaks of the idea of the government or another organization having the control over houses and their furniture and making the people living there only the owners of their own goods .
This is an interesting concept because it can give the government the money it needs to solve its other problems and does n't necessarily break any rule of personal space .
Second of all , as I did say " to a certain degree " , the idea of controlling one 's own choices regarding house picking and what they can do with them takes away a bit of their freedom , which is the complete opposite of what we should get to .
Mankind has always strived for freedom in one way or another , and taking away the control of their own house , their sanctuary , will not be taken lightly by them .
In conclusion , I can not tell whether or not the control of the people 's houses and furniture will bring any help in today 's society , as we are only hypothetically speaking , without any form of testing , however it does have its strong and weak points .
Dear Mr ... ,
First , I want to present myself my name is Daniela and I 'm 16 years old .

I think that I 'm good for this job , because I really sociallize with children .
I like organising activities and games to make people enjoy their time .
I 'm a cheerful person so I would attempt to give my best for receiving the attention of the children .
Also I 'm very responsible and hardworking so I would take care of the children and I would do my tasks the best I could .
Eventually , I want to say that this is an important opportunity for me to learn and to do new things .
It 's a wonderful adventure .
Sincerely ,
Daniela Conti
In this article I am going to write about my favourite sport football .
I love football because it 's a team sport .
You feel that you are a part of the team and everyone is together .
It 's also a really fun sport to play .
It 's really fun when we are playing different cups , Gothia for example .
It is worlds biggest youth cup and are located in Gothenburg in Sweden .
Another cup that is Swedens second biggest cup and are called " Piteå Summer Games " and it is shorten to " PSG " .
Both cups are really fun to play , and it 's extremely fun to go far in the cups .
My advice for people that is going to start football is that you just have to do your best .
And try to be a part of the team , then it 's more fun .
And when a football training goes bad , you do n't have to complain so much about it .
Just keep going and try to do it again .
Of course you can be angry but it 's not a big deal .
Everyone does wrong sometimes , even the best players in the world .
And at last , it is really fun to play .
well , the part of the day that I enjoy the most is nigth because it 's when I arrive at home and I have finish my whole rutine so I can take a break and I can do whatever I want and I can just relax so I would say that nigth is the most relaxing part of my day so it is the one I prefer the most
Ithink there are things you need to plan because it 's important for your life but it depens on the situation because I also like to let thing be alnd let them happend because they have to happend so the majority of time I prefer not to think about it and just let them happend and not to plan anything but if it 's something related with my future or sometehin that will be really afect me I will prefer to plane it like what kind of job I want to do or about my dregree or things like that
Sport centre
The sports centre in Ondara have visitors of several village and from all age groups .
This centre offer several activities like swimnpool , paddle , tennis , ritmica gym , judo , ballet ...
Furthermore , has various coaches and with a perfect timetable for the parents that are busy the daytime and for young that need to go classes after lessons .
This installation is near the field football and basketball court .
In my point of view it is a good situation because the children can do different after school activities without moving too much .
Moreover , for the parents is easier .
I want to emphasize that thanks to his full schedule and amount of the coaches , adults like children can do different activities at the same time instead to have to wait .
On the other hand , the only disadvantage I can see is there are n't activities for the old people .
This centre should provide activities that do not require much physical effort for this kind of people like petanque or something like that .
Finally to say that is a perfect sports centre and inexpensive including a range of activities .
A friendship that ends , never started
You knew him for years or will meet him in a year .
Friends are important and make your life happier .
When you are in a hopeless situation they have the right counsel .
I know my best friends since my childhood .
Thomas , David and I were neighbours and grew up in an ordinary calm village .
We spent a huge period of time together .
Thomas is looking for a thrilling job .
David is in a boarding school in Bern and conclude next summer .
Thomas is a small and fine fellow .
He is one of the most persevering people I know .
David looks bored at the first moment but in fact he is wetty .
His body is large and thick like an elephant .
David is always ready for a joke but amazinly that he has the ability to appear seriously .
Thomas is a calmer person and has the control about the circumstances .
When we meet us and the two friends were walking side by side they look like Laurel and Hardly .
I feel really glad to have friends who have time if I have of something .
I really do n't like to travel by train or by boat .
My favourite way to travel is by plane .
It 's the fastest and most comfortable way to get to your favourite destination .
Especially I like to a first class seat in a plane .
It really feels like you are i a five star Hotel in a luxury suite and not travelling 10000 meters above the ground .
If you need sun and warm weather , you only need to sit in a plane , enjoy your flight and take a pause from your business and from work .
I do n't like to travel by boat , because it 's unconfortable and it takes a fortune till you arrive at your destination .
To travel by train is not an option for me .
It often happens that someone jumps in front of it and you feel the vibration when the train breaks the bones of the dead person .
I would like to talk about a diamond jewellery set that I gifted to my wife on our last marriage anniversary .
This is a set having one diamond necklace , one diamond pendant with a unique shape , one pair of earrings having diamonds and one ring for her ring finger .
The metal used in this set is 18k white gold .
The tool to communicate with foreigners .
Nowadays it is more common that people spend time to learn another language .
There might be many reasons , for school , business , or just for private interest .
In my personal experience I can say that if you learn a foreign language like English , you wo n't have a problem when I 'll go abroad on holiday .
On the other hand , when you learn another language there 's not only benefits but also drawbacks .
You might spend time and money to learn a language .
I want to learn English , and I go to the college twice a week .
However , I must pay the fee and every evening it 's my commitment study something or do my homework .
I suggest having all youngsters , who want to learn another language , they ought to go abroad .
I 've lived in the United Kingdom for more than one year and I 'm learning better than when I was in my country .
The young people should do an experience like this .
Hi Jo !

Cordoba is a trhee hours train ride south of Madrid , and draws visitors from all over the world
Córdoba is not as big as Madrid orSevilla but i love it .

Out of the Mosque you can see Narrows streets with flowers and a Roman Bridge , it is a wonderful chance to have a relaxing prom .
For a job i recomended you travel to the coast in Cadiz , Malaga or Huelva and look for a job in the beach because at the sime time you are in the beach you could obtain money .

Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
The bomb was going to blow up in a few minutes .
The train was running still too fast to jump off and soon it 'll be arrived in Milan central station .
All in all , he would n't be able to stop the device .
Only a few long seconds spent thinking about what he had to do : he had to save the passengers .
He desperately run through the train towards the driver .
He tried to push the door that led to the head of the engine , but it was locked from the inside .
A cold chill run along his neck .
He was scared .
He wanted to cry .
Desperately he started to kick the door , furiously , blind with rage , harder , faster .
The door opened .
Then he saw the commander was lying dead in his chair .
He was shot in his head .
Fortunately , a voice from the radio was trying to contact the man .
In a hurry he dashed to the microphone and answered the control station .
" Where are the brakes ? "
Now in the distance he could see the first skylines of the city .
The train was finally stopped .
That day he came a hero .
He saved 220 people and among them he knew the girl that 5 years later became his wife .
I used to play basketball for three years and it was a great experience and I had a lot of fun .
I enjoyed playing basketball not only because I wanted to play a sport but even because it 's a healthy way of leaving .
If you are playing a sport you improve your abilities went your working in a team in which all the players have the same aim from the game : winning the match .
The advice that I would give the people that would like to start playing this sport is that they should have a bit of experience in working in a team that is full of new people .
The most important thing that ya person should know about this game is that a lot of intelligence is requested because you must know how to reach how to get nearer to make their aim become reality , and that one is that the team should score as much as they can to win the match and have fun .
In my opinion this sport will always be my favourite because it made me feel happy and have a great time with my friends , and it also maintained me in good shape .

I strongly believe that research has a valuable benefits to society and the environment .
For example , making the life better and comfortable .
Bachelor 's paper [ 1 ] is one of the good sources of describing what does research mean .
He mentioned about an important point for doing a good research .
First of all , researchers should be interested in what they are doing .
Interesting in the area of research leads to invent and optimize ideas that are already existing .
Second , critical thinking which is the deep thinking about the problem and the way to solve it , is an important factor of successful research .
Also , honesty , originality which is the ability to think critically , independent and creative , and precision let research to be more valuable .
Moreover , working as a team for researching , let researchers gain lots of research benefits .
Such as , ideas and learning more the best methods to analyze data .
All members of the team will get benefits and push each other to achieve the goal by giving some advice and more information .
In addition , Clear , easy to understand , and precise scientific paper are one way to represent , share , and discuss the ideas and results with others in a scientific environment .
Also , Seminars are other good sources to come up and listen to a new idea .
Exchange information with other researchers , via scientific papers or seminars , sometimes come up with solutions for other researches ' problems .
Researchers should not give up when face hard problem with the research and keep try by different ways to solve it and they will do it at the end .
To conclude , there are some of an important research principles .
Whenever researchers consider most or all of them when working on the research , researchers will get results with a high precision .
Researchers enjoy their research as an enjoyable activity .
There are two choices to travel : by own car and by pubic transport .
In my opinion , I prefer to travel by car for those reasons .
First , I can travel by my own car whenever and wherever I want .
For example , if I travel to my company by bus , I must be on time and follow the bus schedule .
Sometimes , bus schedule does not suitable for me .
Maybe , bus comes too early or too late for me to go to work .
Traveling by car , I can choose the time .
Moreover , I can choose my own route to go to work .
I can stop at my favorite coffee shop to buy drinks for breakfast .
Second , I feel comfortable when I travel by my own car . I hate to travel by public transport because it is sometimes too crowded and noisy .
In rush hours , I do not have a seat and I stand all the time for a half hours .
In my own car , I can relax with music and enjoy fresh air .
Furthermore , I do not worry about the theft or any crime which used to happen when I traveled by train .
Generally , although traveling by public transport is cheaper than by car .
However , I find traveling by my own car much more advantages than others .
Therefore , I think public transport will be disappeared in the future .
Dear Paul ,
As I told you before , last month I was helping at a concert of the greatest band in the world - Atmasfera .
I was so happy when I heard that they are coming to Katowice !
Immediately I contacted their manager , asking If they could do with some help .
She said that they will need someone who can take care of their performance outfits .
That was such a good idea !
Not only I was close to them , I was also doing something I 'm really good at !
Day before the concert , I met band members , and we started try on clothes for the next day .
We had so much fun !
They turned out to be such a wonderful people , they treated me like an old friend , making jokes all the time and even invited me to eat dinner with them .
On the day of the concert , I met band two hours before start , I ironed all clothes , I even do girls hairstyle .
When the concert hall was full , band came on the stage .
In the headlights , they all looked so beautiful !
I felt like that was partly my doing .
I was part of the team .
That was what I particularly liked about that experience !
I was dancing and singing all show , and after manager came to me and asked if I would like to work with them full time .
I will have to sleep on it .
What do you think I should do ?
And how was your weekend ? Hope to see you soon !

There is no future for public transport ?
It 's not true .
I ca n't imagine our world without public transport .
I regularly take trains to go somewhere .
So do other people in my country , especially old people who have not got their own cars .
I catch buses regularly and see a lot of people there .
You can imagine how great is idea to leave your own car and take a bus to go to work or go shopping .
Another good idea is to use bicycles .
I 'm glad that every year we have such a wonderful day called " A day without cars " or something like that when people try to use public transport rather that their own cars .
We can help our environment to be healthier !
Dear Jane ,
Thanks for your letter - it was great to hear from you .
I was absolutely thrilled to read that you 've got a job as tour guide in the Congo rainforest !
Well done !
I 'm sorry it has taken me so long to write , but I have been working my fingers to the bone preparing for my exams , for which I 'm annoyingly nervous .
Speaking of nervousness , I think I 've found a solution for you to shake off your nerves about using the English tenses correctly .
You wrote that this sometimes made you stutter during tours , which made you feel rather uncertain .
However , there 's no need to worry any longer , if you have a look at www.elihinkel.org/tips/tenses.htm .
At this website , you can find a clear , detailed explanation of the tenses , with illuminating animations .
I got to leave off now , I 'm afraid .
Hopefully you 're able to visit the site .
I 'm sure that if you spend some time studying the information you can find there , you 'll have mastered the tenses the next time we see each other .
Keep me posted on your experiences in the jungle !
Love ,
Suzanne
Recently works Google , a multi - million dollar company , who is not only famous for search engines on self - driving cars .
Entering your car and giving the directions and then having a stress - free drive towards your destination and let a computer take control of your ride is not a distant dream anymore .
But are driverless cars as safe as old fashion cars ?
It is surely a fact that autopilots in car 's sure are handy .
It takes hours driving to and from , hours where one just have to concentrate on driving , hours gone futile .
Although it must be admitted that driverless vehicles are expected to help children , the blind , the elderly and others who currently can not safely drive themselves .
On the other hand it will lead to more driving , because smarter driving reduces the cost per mile of vehicle usage .
The end result of additional driving could be more traffic and more aggregate fuel consumption .
To put the whole matter in a nutshell the self - driving system is good to prevent accidents .
However you should still be able to drive by yourself you can not only rely on that system it is still not free from errors .
The Colosseum is a beautiful structure in the heart of Rome , Italy .
More than two thousand years old , it is still standing .
Even thought it is in ruins , visitors from all over the world come to see it .
It was an immense amphitheater .
Thousands of people fought as gladiators .
Today , Not many amphitheaters are standing .
It is in the shape of oval but most of it is broken .
The italian name , Colosseo is quite close to english .
Visitors can enter it and admire the inside .
The Colosseum is a quite tall structure .
It is the most popular amphitheater in the whole world .
Come and visit the Colosseum and discover it 's beauty !

Have you ever imagined your life without computers ?
many people consider it indispensable .
Like many others , it seems to me that it involve various positive aspects to everyone .
In fact , a significant number of people agree that computers have made our lives much easier than before .
Nowadays , you can chat with your friends via computer even if they are on the other side of the planet .
Computers help us in organizing our data , also you can find any information you want very fast as it has lots of search engines .
Another reason , knowing how to use a computer is necessary in most jobs .
A lot computers advertise their goods on the Internet so millions of people would know it - computers enable us to automate various tasks that we can not do manually and that is really helpful .
Computers can help you with your homework to find the information you need .
Finally , in my opinion computers is very useful to all of us .
He had to study more than ever in his life .
The first partial tests were going to be soon .
Everyday , everyhour he found his self thinking about the future .
the job he 'll have , the clothes he 'll wear , the food he 'll cook ... he had almost every inch of his future planned .
But firstly he had to pass the exams .
That was the key to open the treasure trunk , full of golden options .
As his mother he would work as an advocate .
He would make a name for his self working hard , and his family would be proud .
The truth is that everybody had really high expectations of him .
The idea of becoming the people protector face to the law , was n't his .
When he was little , he heard his family talking about how happy they were because his brother Peter waas following the steps of his mom .
Sadly Peter was no longer there .
Michael 's mother cried for months and his father tried to look strong , but you could hear him sobbing at night .
Michael thought that playing his brother 's role would help .
He closed the door and knew at that moment that he had made a mistake .
Dear Madam / Sir ,
I have read your hotel 's advertisement about Niagara Fall 's romance package in a newspaper .
I am writing to you because I am interested in booking this service at your hotel and would like to receive some further information in advance .
First of all , could you provide me information about the whole costs of the package ?
What I am most interested in , is a room with a fall 's view indeed .
Can you assure me of getting one by all means ?
Since I want to spend a night with my partner at your hotel at the end of December , I need a confirmation on your part of providing the room at that time .
Can I be sure that the hotel will not be booked up between Christmas and New Year 's Eve ?
In addition , could you provide me information about the nearest airport and about the way to get to your hotel from there ? We must know this for any case since we are going to travel by plane from Budapest , Hungary . I would be pleased if you could assist me in booking a cheap flight as well .
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon with all the details which you can provide me .
Yours faithfully ,
Vera Borbála Solt
We live in the century of the speed .
Each year we use more and more types of transport : buses , trams , subway , trains , airplanes , etc .
And of course , we use more and more personal cars .
Do I think that public transport will gone in the future ?
Yes I do .
One of the reasons is the time .
Now we are spending too much time in waiting for public transport and of course we would like to get our destination as fast as possible , but public transport does n't provide such possibility for us .
That is why we try to buy our personal car .
Furthermore we use personal vehicles or rent cars for travelling , because it is more convenient and gives us the feelings of our independence .
I understand completely that some types of public transport such as airplanes and ships , will exist some time .
But this is an exception because existing technologies do not allow the usage of such personal transport as we would at present day .
But , the future will change this situation .
Helping Strangers
I used to helping people when needing , I do n't prefer to be a bystander .
First of all , my altruistic nature is due to my biological desire to help other .
for instance , one day I was walking in the garden when I saw a girl falling down from a children swing in a playing area , I helped her immediately , after I was sure enough that she was fine , I called her mother and told her about this incident , she thanked me a lot .
I was thinking she was my responsibility , but it ca n't be the same every time .
in addition , young ages are observing an altruistic behavior from month 18th .
for example , last week I was stressed out , so I lost my phone at the university , I was not realizing that until I returned home . while I was on my way to the university , my little sister praying for me to finding out my phone .
so , in my opinion children when they are witness always want to help strangers .
Finally , scientists hypothesize that our brains are helpful enough when we can helping out other people .
Dear Alison ,
Hi !
How are you?I hope everything is alright .
I 'm writing to say that I 'll be delighted you to be my guest at home next month .
Now let me give you some advice about how to get to my place in Madrid .
When you get to Barajas airport you 'll have to take the subway and go to Atocha station and there you 'll have to change line and catch line three to get Sol station .
I 'll be there to meet you .
If you 're not for it you can just get a taxi at Barajas airport to the same direction .
I strongly recommend the first option because it 's cheaper than the second one .
Besides this way you can have an exciting start in Madrid .
If you get lost in the metro do n't worry .
Give me a ring and I 'll pick you up wherever you are .
I hope to hear from you soon .
Best regards .
Juan
Saving the environment
AS we know our planet 's condition is getting worse every day .
Because human activity releases into the air substances that damage several things in our planet such as the atmosphere and ecosystems .
The global warming , deforestation and drought are some of the consequences , therefore we can do countless things that appear to be meaningless but if everyone does it we can live in a much healthier planet .
Every day scientists try to develop new ways to improve the way we live , so that we are hable to pollute less the planet .
One of the things discovered by these scientists are the Eco - homes , in other words Eco - homes are a type of homes that help us causing less damage to the planet and atmosphere in our everyday life .
It sounds a little bit strange but by installing solar paniels and other features in these homes we live a much greener life , undoubtedly there would be some changes but because we know why we are doing it there would be no problems .
Also the effects of those actions would be gigantic and would help improve the environment situation nevertheless we will still have to change some activities and be less self - centred so that we can all work for a greater objective .
In my opinion in a decade we will be living in these homes , I ca n't wait to live it
I practise several sports , but my favourite is football .
I play football twice a week as minimum .
I enjoy playing this sport because it is very funny and competitive .
Furthermore , football give you the opportunity to make friends because it is a team sport .
With football you can move all the muscles in your body and also exercise your mind thinking about what is the best pass or when you have to run or stop .
If you want to start to play football my advice is to be fit , because if you are n't , you can hurt your bones or muscles .
In order to be fit , you can run or ride a bike for two or three weeks and after that , you are going to be prepared to play football .
The equipment is very important too .
So wear comfortable clothes and a good trainers .
I recommend you to play it with your friends , but if you are in a new city , you can search teams on the Internet .
There are a lot of opportunities .
To improve your skills you can practise alone and you will became better than before .
So play football and enjoy it .
Hi Jay !
You 're right , in fact it was very difficult to me but I finally took this decision because I want to make new experiences .
I'm very excited!I'm going to the United Kingdom in a week 's time but I 've already made some plans about it .
First of all I 'd love to visit new places .
Would you mind making a list of places you like the most ? .
Moreover I need to organise a tandem to improve my English but if it would n't work I could attend an English course .
Do you know any languages school?They're very expensive so I will need more money .
Speaking about money ... I really need to find a job !
I have to get money if I want to stay there for half a year !
And my parents refused to give it to me because they say I must become indipendent .
Will I succeed ?
Who knows ...
In the meantime what about helping me to find a part - time job ?
I ca n't definitely get a full - time job 'cause I want to relax and have fun .
Text me if you find something for me .
Best wishes .

Dear
I 'm very glad to receive your letter . I 've not heard from you for ages .
How are you ?
There are my answers to your questions .
My class visits museums once a month .
My favourite museum is the Hermitage that is in the heard of my city .
I think that everybody should visit it because you can see beautiful paintings of gifted and famous artists .
It 's a great idea to go hiking with your family .
When and where are you going hiking ?
Have you bought any equipment yet ?
Did you go hiking last year ?
Hope to hear from you soon .

The Vietnamese education and study system is completely different from the Australian one .
Like to Asia countries , such as : Korea , China , Singapore , the Vietnamese education and study system is really harsh and highly competitive to all students , especially for the primary students .
Firstly , the primary education and study system of Vietnam is very hard .
They have to study a lot with from 5 - 6 subjects in a semester .
These subjects mainly focus on math skills , grammar , writing , but there are not any courses related to life and communication skills or innovative science .
All subjects are less flexible and all students are learning the same programs at the same time .
Meanwhile , the Australian education and study system is easier and more enjoyable than Vietnamese system .
In a class , there are very few students with many more flexible study programs .
The primary students are touch many different life skills by teachers at school .
Additionally , the subjects in the school are given with the aim to develop thinking and creativity of students .
They also play many interesting sports .
Secondly , it is not only from the school but also Vietnamese parents of the primary students are also expected in the education of their children .
They usually hope that their children get on the highest scores in school .
Therefore , outside the school , Vietnamese parents want to send their children to tutorial classes , such as : math , writing , grammar , … .
Consequently , Vietnamese children have not any life skills and have many health problems , such as : short - sighted , tummy - ache , spinal column … Sadly , the proportion of Vietnamese children who are short - sighted tend to increase in recent years .
Meanwhile , Australian parents also care about their children but other way with Vietnamese parents .
Outside the school , they send their kids to sport Centre or go to the social activities .
Sum up , Australian children are happier than Vietnamese children . I think that primary students need to spend more time for playing and enjoy their childhood .
I loved to climb from the word go .
My first time was an exciting experience I will never forget : the touch of the rock , the high , the pain in your fingers ... I like climbing because this sport makes me feel alive , even sometimes I feel fear .
But do n't think that climbing is a dangerous activity!. Although you climb to the top of a rock wall , you always do it with a checked security material .
Firstly , if you want to climb you will need , at least , a partner .
You must rely your life on this person , so it 's important you get on with him or her .
It is perhaps for this reason that people who climb are often couples !
Moreover , climbing is a sport in which it 's not too important if you are a man or a woman because you does n't only use your strength but also your equilibration .
You should give a try to this amusing and thrilling sport that it 's a sort of competition with yourself : every day a little bit higher , every day a little bit difficult ..
If you take up climbing , I 'm sure you 'll carry on ! !
My holidays
I love holidays and summer , the season I like best because of a lot of things : In summer I always go to the mountains , in my grandparents ' house , where I get fun with my uncles and cousins .
Grandma 's food is great and I spend days staying outside , playing badminton or volleyball or having a walk in the wood .
Some days we have a long trip too .
We bring food and drinks and we spend a day in beautiful places such as the top of a montain , an amazing castle or a tipical market of a town .
But what I love best are the afternoons with my favourite cousin , Sara , and his brother , Luke .
We play Risiko fou hour : we 're never fed up !
In winter is even better : there 's a lot of snow and we often go skiing on the near peaks : skiing is my favourite sport , I do that since I was five and I love doing the most difficult slops , and Christmas is beautiful with the people I love best .
These are some reasons of why I love mountains and why I spend there most of my holiday .
we were in cold
Hi Mitak ,
I have recently watched The Ultiamtum of Bourne and I 'm so excited to share it with you . I believe you 'll absolutely love it .
It is action movie that involves the secret games of CIA .
The film is about this CIA assassin who ca n't remember his past , but he knows he 's chased by the agancy .
Eventually , he reads about a journalist who is writing about him and a program called Black Brare .
Just before the assets get the journalist Jason Bourne helps him to escape .
He tried to get some information from the guy , but unfortunately a sniper shots him dead .
I will not tell you what happens afterwords not to spoil it for you .
My friend , I can not recommend this film enough .
It is a piece of work indeed .
If you 'd like to see it I 'm going to come along with you to the cinema , because I really wish to watch it again .
Dear Paul ,
I 'm sorry I haven't written to you for so long .
As you know I was really busy last month .
My teacher asked me to organise a charity concert in our school .
My task was to find a band of musicians who would play at our concert .
I must admit it was really hard to find a really good group of players , who would juice up the audience and also play for free .
I decided to organise a casting .
It was so exciting and funny listenig to all those musicians , because some of them actually did n't have the skills to play and did n't have the charm needed to warm up the people .
In the end all went fantastic .
We managed to raise much more money for a good cause than we hoped to raise .
That 's all for the time being .
Write to me soon and give my regards to your parents .
Bye ,
Paula
Throughout my life I lived in a few cities and villages located in South of Russia .
Each of the cities has unique set of transportation means .
In villages the only way of public transportation is small buses , most of which can service up to twenty passengers in any moment of time .
In regional centers most people commute via trolleybuses and tramcars .
The latest is transport of choice of most people because its passengers very rarely lose time in traffic jams due to dedicated railway passages .
Those who are not satisfied with public transportation system may use private vehicles .
I estimate more then 99 percent of them are cars .
Rarely we can see bicycles and scooters .
I used to travel on buses .
But recently I bought a cheap bike and really enjoyed riding in summer time .
Now , in November , weather in Russia is not so good so I switched back to buses .
My most recent dream is to ride on EuroVelo roads network .
I expect them to be much more suitable for bikes compared to local roads .
I wish road surface quality in Russia will improve year on year .
Hello my name is Nina Joly and I 'm seventeen .
I still go to high school where I study four languages , French , Spanish , English and Italian .
Thanks to my mom , to travels and to the people I 've met I 've learnt how to speak fearless and quite fluently in English .
I absolutely love children and honestly they love me ; I think it is a sort of a gift , because not all the people love children and can get on well with them .
I 've had a little bit of experience in summer baby sitting some kids ; in Italy it is more diffiult to be a babysitter because if you are underage , parents should have responsibility on you so it is better to be over 18 .
I love playing with kids but as always there are some rules that have to be followed .
The most important rule , in my opinion , is " having fun without hurting or getting hurt " .
During those few times with which I built my experience we all played together and we cooked together , so I taught them how to make some chicken and some pasta in an Italian way .
Honestly I 'm not the best cook ever , but I can make a few good things like scarbled eggs , pasta and meet .
One of my carachteristics is that I 'm a very precise person , for example I enjoy making lists because they make my mind clearer , and I strictly follow what I wrote so everything , hopefully , endes well .
Thank you for your time and attention .
Trust in flying with a horse
I really like many sports on this world . I go to ge gym daily to stay fit and healthy .
But my overall favourite sport is riding horses .
I 'm doing it since I 'm six years old .
It is so fascinating for me to build up a relationship to the horse you ride .
You know what is the most important thing about riding horses ?
It is all about trust .
If you provide confidence , the horse will trust you .
With this reliance you can go throughout everything together .
Many people think , it 's not really a sport .
But believe me , riding uses so much endurance !
What I like mostly about all the different sections of riding horses is jumping .
I feel so free when I can fly over these obstacles .
Another good feeling is the speed when you gallop .
Surely this was not everything .
Riding means also to clean the horse and look after it , but nevermind , it 's the best sport you can do .
As the production of cars is increased , it seems that the needs for public transportation is declined .
Some insist that no one need bus or subway in the future .
However , in my opinion , it rather useful to use public vehicles as time goes by based on two critical reasons .
First , people do n't want to waste their time finding parking lots .
The more people have their own cars , the more space to park is needed .
Unfortunately , there is a certain limit to space , so it is not possible that everyone use their car every day especially in mega cities like Seoul , New York , and London .
It is more convenient to move from here to there when you take the bus or subway because you do n't have to worry about your car while working .
The second reason is more important and obvious .
It is related to the environmental issues .
Using public means help to protect the Earth from air pollution .
There are so many kinds of problems which the environmental pollution causes .
The pollution is a kind of global issues of which people should consider seriously .
Without reducing personal vehicles , there is no solution of that problem .
Surely , the government will try to make a better system of public transport because they want citizens not to use their own means .
For these reasons , there will be the future for the public transport always .
Moreover , it is quite optimistic that people will need more it rather than private transport .

This topic leads me to think of professional skill " Architecture design " .
This result in different of views on whether people agree the best things for improvement people 's lives have already taken place .
I hold the belief that the topic for me is completely wrong , even some improvements are easy to use and solves the most of problems .
First , the development of population still continue , the space for living still a serious problem although , the skyscraper already solved the most of problems from population crisis .
On the other hand , the skyscraper makes more problems , such as pollution .
For example , I designed the highly architecture in the highly population density city in Taiwan .
The skyscraper provides more space for excess population ; however , the building will produces more pollution when the skyscraper constructs by modern materials , such as steel and concrete .
They will destroy the environment when the raw material digs out from the site .
The pollution must hurt the local people and environment from the site of raw materials .
This is why I mentioned that the problem still exists and the problem only transforms to another regions and type .
Second , the computer system looks like solves the most of problems ; however , this system make more dangerous in specific situations .
The " BUG " must be appears from man - made system because of the incomplete coding .
That is why our personal information always leaks to the " hacker " .
For instance , when we enjoy the electronic commercial service and shop the goods on the Internet , the hacker may steal the private information at the same time .
They will use that information to cheat people 's money on the phone and you will trust them because of the correct personal information .
This is normal phenomenon in Taiwan ; however , police ca n't do anything because of the hacker 's anonymity .
That is what I said that the best improvement things still not exist , even the computer system already solved some problems .
Of course , some people may be moved to disagree with my position on this issue .
That being said , I still feel the reasons I have presented was strong ones , such as architecture and computer system .
Dear Jane ,
As soon as I read the article about your problem , I decided to write you at once and give you some suggestions , since I have the similar interest in physical fitness , too .
I feel very strongly that the daily exercise is a basic definition which we must keep if we want to be on shape .
To start with , a simple way to work out is not to get the bus for school .
For example , you could go on foot or with your bicycle accompanied by your friends instead.by doing this , you will burn more and more calories daily without a special equipment and having fun with your pals .
Furthermore , if I were you , I would go with engaging in healh club .
For instance , signing up for hip - hop dance or aerobic classes as I do , it would be a nice idea .
In this way , you will do a hard - working exercise without realising it , as you will enjoy yourself at the same time .
What is more , it could help if you work out at home and buy gym equipment such as treadmill or a bicycle .
By doing the chores of the house like the washing is another way to exercise as well .
As a result , you will save time and embarrassment , especially if you are out of shape .
To sum up , if you follow my options you 'll see results directly and I 'm sure you will not regret it .
You will not feel self - confident and glad , but your outward appearance wiil be better .
Friendship today
Friendship is actually a really important issue nowadays .
Plenty of ways can be used to make new friends .
Facebook , Twitter … all of these social networks offer us the easiest way to find new friends .
But are they real ones ?
In my opinion the best way to develop your new friendship is , meeting them , have a coffee a drink or whatever .
Talking is truly the unique way to get to know people and establish strong bound .
Moreover , some guys try to find friends who always agree with them .
However , it could be a little bit unhealthy .
To tell you frankly a best friend has to offer you a different point of view and what is more it is important say no sometimes .
For all of these reasons we have to take care our friendship theses days and social networks are ok to be in touch with your friends but if you wo n't to make new ones .
Go anywhere !
And meet new people .
Money : essential for youngsters ?
At the age of eighteen , most of British students are finishing secondary school .
A new , tougher world is in front of them as they get ready for collage or to embark on their professional career .
The family financial support , at this stage , seems almost essential .
With this in mind , some questions arise : Should young people be given all money easily or should they put in a great deal of effort to get it ?
Should parents prepare the ground for their sons ' success or just let them work hard to build their lives ?
We have to admit that toil and trouble are urgent needs of this juvenile generation .
Why do we call them youngsters ?
Because they are so , and there is no trouble with that .
But there comes a time when they are supposed to make it to adulthood .
At this point , lack of money might be a blessing in disguise .
The more they sweat to chase their dreams , the fast they ripen and prize what they earn .
I 'm not dismissing the idea of financial aid , though .
Do n't get me wrong , please .
What I 'm doing is challenging the way we approach to it .
We have to preserve the ethical value of maintenance at the same time we help the next generations to succeed by their own means .
If we can provide youngsters with money and still avoid they grow lazy , then economic relief is welcomed .
Undoubtedly , I 'm presenting a major challenge to every parent : shall we be able to take care for youngsters provision and yet teach them that money does n't grow on trees ?
Money is almost essential , but the way young people learn to interact with this is essential to shape a society that appreciates what it obtains through effort .
My holidays in Spain ( 2nd part )
My holidays was here !
I arrived to Spain on Sunday morning , It was a lovely sunny day in Malaga .
I arrived very exahusted , because I could't sleep the night before .
I had to wait awake in the airport !
When I arrived at home , I just wondered one thing , sleep , so I did .
I was sleeping all the afternoon .
I was really tired !
Monday , I had the typical " family day " , I had been eating with all my family in our cottage .
Then I met with my friends and we had a nice evening drinking some beers in the pubs .
The Tuesday was an extraordinary beach day .
I was all the day liying in the beach , talking with my friends and having an incredibly time with them .
Wednesday was the relaxed day .
I was all the day at home with my cat watching English film and eating Spanish desert .
In Andalusia , in Easter , the typical desert it 's called " pestiño " .
It a sweet olive oil pastry with honey .
My mum was preparing the day before , and was really yummy .
I almost eat it all !
My family is catholic so in Easter , the main days for our religion are Thursday and Friday , for my family too .
I 'm catholic , I believe in God but I 'm not very friendly with the Vaticano 's rules .
I 'm a free catholic .
Probably it sounds weird , but I 'm on my way .
These two day were family days , I had to go to the church to a mess which represent the last alive days from Jesuschrist : the last dinner and the passion .
At least , these weekend I did n't do anything in special , because I feel tired and I had n't got money enough to do any special plan .
Finally , the day to comes to England had arrived .
Monday I came back to London and my holidays had finished .
See you soon Spain !
In my opinion public transport is the future , because its quality and comfort will improve and it 'll be easier to move and cheaper too .
Travelling by car is so much more conveniente if we think about small places such as villages or small towns .
Imagine to go by car to cities like London , is it the car more convenient ?
If you consider the cahotic traffic and the long queues to get there and impact of these factores on people 's health and people 's finances , I 'm sure you 'll change your mind about public transport .
In the last few years public transport has been improving a lot in terms of technology , flexibility and diversity in terms of timetables , tickets and places .
Besides these , the public transport is better for the environment , especially the electric bus .
The electric bus is an option in many countries as a way to improve the environment .
This type of transport is a great contribution to the environment , because it 's cleaner than those that need petrol or diesel to work .
On the other hand , is possible to find hibrid cars but they are more expensive than those that works with normal fuel and for that reason people 's first option is not this kind of car .
The theme of environment is very important nowadays and can cost a lot to a country .
A country has to pay for their ecological foot and this means as much pollution is produced more environment damage , in other words bigger ecological foot , and consequently more has to be paid .
Governments will define environmental stategies in order to decrease the costs of ecological foot .
Such strategies will involve taxes above poluent cars , the increase of fuel price and definition of benefits to those who opts for more environmental means of transport .
So the convenience of travelling by car is not totally true .
Of course you are owner of your time and destinations , but it is enough ?
Think about its impact on your espences and on the environment , would n't be better to take a bus , an underground or a train ?
If we consider all the factors mentioned above , probably much people will change their mind .
Dear USA Summer Camps ,
I am Ana Alicea Benavidez , a student from the Faculty of Medicine of Málaga , where a girl , who was one of your volunteer , was talking about this project the last week , she suggested we to join it .
I have working in different activities like this , for example in a famous basketball team as a volunteer , or in the hospital with children and their parents who live there .
Moreover , I live alone in my home , therefore I can cook and be an excellent cooker too .
I consider I am a fun , communicative and responsible person with experience in this kind of activities , and who can help in all the things you need .
Because of that , I think that I could take part in your team and I would be a suitable person for you .
Finally , I would like to know where will be the camps exactly because I need to buy the flights .
Yours sincerely ,
Ana
A wise man said " The pen is mightier than the sword " ( Edward Bulwer - Lytton ) .
These words reflect the power and the importance of writing and reading across mankind 's history .
Although there are a lot of reasons that support that idea , this article focuses about the importance of reading as a great tool to exercise our brain .
First of all , the brain is a complex part of our body that is able to process information and create knowledge based on stimulus .
Those kinds of stimulus come from several sources and they help you in different measures to exercise the brain .
However , reading is the most important source to exercise the brain because it presents a lot of challenges for our mind .
For instance , when you read , you have to associate characters and places , and memorize details .
Those kinds of things help to the brain to be more active and process information faster .
At second , there are some researches that prove that in general people who read are smarter than people who do not .
This affirmation is based in the fact of the increase of literacy and development of verbal intelligence that people get when they exercise the brain reading books .
This is another big reason to take care about reading , because in this competitive world , only smart people will be able to get the best opportunities available in society .
At third , when people read , they have to use the imagination to get a better idea of what 's going on .
That situation is another example of how reading is an excellent brain 's exercise , because when people have to imagine things , the brain has to be creative , and that kind of process is too important to improve yourself in problem 's resolution and creation of important ideas in real life .
In general all the things described before show how important is reading to exercise the brain .
So , next time when you try to avoid a book , think first whether you need that your brain works faster or be more creative , because could be a good idea to exercise a little bit your brain with reading .
Review Silence of the Lambs
There are many good movies , especially thrillers are always enjoyable in my opinion .
One of those is the movie ' Silence of the Lambs ' , where Clarice , an FBI agent in training , has been asked to talk to an imprisoned Hannibal Lecter who has information about a serial killer the FBI has been trying to catch .
There were several reasons why this movie stood out .
First I was really impressed by the performance of Jodi Foster ( Clarice ) and Anthony Hopkins ( Hannibal ) .
I have always thought of them as really good actors , but they were exquisite in this movie .
Not only in their individual parts , but also in the scenes they did together .
Secondly , the storyline was unpredictable and really clever and for that really enjoyable .
You had to pay attention throughout the entire movie to keep up with the story .
On top of that was there tension at all times .
This movie is outstanding , I believe that even people who are not really into thrillers will enjoy watching it .
As I mentioned before , are both the acting and the storyline really impressive .
You will be watching with full interest .
At last is the character of Hannibal Lecter one of a kind , there is no other movie where you will find a figure like him .
Dearest Renee ,
How 's your first English literature lesson at school ? I hope it had loads of fun with plenty new knowledge acquired !
I had learnt the special features of the 16th century acting business and theatres in London as well as the lifetime of William Shakespeare .
I ca n't wait to tell you more !
You may have thought theatres would be fashionable place for the royalty , courtiers and merchants .
However , it was not .
During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and King James I , play watching was an entertainment for the locals to relax .
As it cost very little to get into an open - aired theatre , everyone jammed and jostled to watch plays , though the poor stood under bright sunshine and had their heads burnt while the rich sat in the shelter with an extra shilling paid .
At the same time , actors were busy dressing and reciting the scripts . '
Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs . '
Do you remember this famous quote from Romeo and Juliet ?
At that time , males had to work while the female were forced to stay at home and do all the household chores .
Frankly speaking , actresses did NOT exist !
These actors paid full attention to convenience the audience that it was graceful Juliet rather than a stiff boy acting .
They used props , thick make - up , gowns , wigs and all sorts of accessories .
The ' Juliets ' even had to shave their beard and moustache and enjoy their role throughout the play .
What a gargantuan sacrifice of self - esteem and reputation they had given up !
One more interesting fact is that , both the lovers in the play were Italians but their playwright had never been to Italy .
It could reflect 16th century London was a melting point of different cultures and Shakespeare probably got in touch Italian culture by making friends with those local visitors .
Three trumpet blasts were given symbolizing the start of play , yet none of the respected silence would be given .
Audience would boo and throw fruits to the actors in case they did n't like them .
Special dramatic effects were thus added on stage .
Cannonballs were rolled around to make sound of thunder .
Pig 's blood was used during casualties or deaths in sword fighting .
Stage trapdoors allowed actors to vanish magically .
In a roofed - in theatre , pulleys and machinery were used for lowering actors on stage .
Shakespeare provided everything the people asked for --- laughter , romance , and tragidies .
The play lover , King James I was impressed and became the patron of the Lord Chamberlain 's Men .
The company changed its name into ' the King 's Men ' and performed over 200 plays !
By now , I have widened my horizons and increased my interest towards the spotlight on playhouses .
I wish you love it either !
Write soon !
Cheers ,
Michelle
As you asked I am going to give the information of how my village looks after the environment .
My village has been working on this project for decades they have been fixing their techniques and they still know a day 's everything has cost us a lot of effort we started from the easiest examples ( dividing rubbish into different containers ) to some that are more complex ( renewable energy ) .
We live in an area where its population has all types of animals which can get hurt very easily by human 's activities ; so in our community we have very strict rules when referring to taking care of the environment .
The principal things everyone must have at their houses are three trash can for the division of the trash ; one must be for renewable materials ( rest of food , paper , carton … ) another for plastics and the last one for glass .
All the energy being used in the town is renewable energy ; ( hydraulic energy , solar energy and wind energy ) every house has a solar panel that gets the sun light transforming it into energy , that provide part of the energy to each house the days that the sun shines but if there is no sun the village has a dam beside us which provides them enough with water for the whole village and also with hydraulic energy ; not only we have hydraulic energy but also wind energy ; in the out skirts of the village there is a wind power plant where the wind energy is produced .
Also our water has one of the best purification methods after we use it we clean it so we do n't contaminate the water of the river or dam .
To try to keep the environment clean we have a big group of voluntary workers that work after their jobs here trying to keep this area as clean as possible by picking all the rubbish and controlling the whole area in case there is something not normal .
Apart from this group of voluntaries every person of the village is obliged to take care of the environment and use the car as little as possible so the pollution is as minimum as possible here the bicycle is the most famous way of transport car are n't common they are only used when transporting heavy thing or when travelling long distances .
Nowadays , many people like do the shopping .
But everyone think in that way ?
Some of them think that buying things are very boring and unnecessary .
First advantage of buying new things in shops is that it is very satisfying , in particular for women .
Many of them are relaxed when they are searching for new , remarkable clothes .
Secondly , we could find shocking bargain in shops .
Shops could give us even 70 percent of sale , what helps saving more money .
On the other hand , doing the shopping is not only something enjoyable .
One of the drawback of going to the shop is that we spend huge amount of money .
We would buy next , impracticable high - heel shoes , which will spend couple of years in wordrobe .
Last but not least disadvantage against for doing the shopping , in the mall could prowl many pickpokets , because they could rob us .
In conclusion , buying new things is a good idea to spend fascinating time with friends , however we could also lose a lot of money .
Personally , I do not agree with the statement " shopping is not always enjoyable " , because I like this kind of spending leisure time , for instant , with my mom or friends .
This bar chart deals with the costs of three different photocopiers .
Therefore it compares the purchase price , the warranty expenses and the running costs of each product .
Interestingly the pruchase price of " Carde " and " KD " is almost the same .
In " Cardas " case the amount is $ 600 and " KDs " price is vagualy $ 700 .
However " Sebu " rocks with a pruchase price of $ 1,000 .
All photocopiers show a very low warranty price .
In this category " KD " exeeds with cost of $ 200 .
Wherby " Carda " and " Sebu " score with warrnty expenses under $ 150 .
" Cada"s product has the highest running costs with $ 1,200 .
In the case of " KD " the running charges come only up to $ 800 and " Sebu " has obviously the lowest expenses with $ 600 .
As a long term investion I would choose " Sebus " model even its purchase price is very high .
The reason therefore are its small warranty and especially running costs .
The kenn running expenses will compensate the purchase price in the future .
In today 's world , nearly every person take care of what she or he is wearing .
Many people claim , that wearing fashionable clothes is very important .
It seems to me that these clothes may have a high price and sometimes they do not worth it .
Some people fear if they do not wear the latest fashion , they wo n't be valuable person .
They spend a fortune on outfits and wait for being admired and appreciated .
Wearing any kind of clothes have an effect on you , and obviously on your image .
I agree with the idea that clothes can help in expressing ourselves .
It is very important to choose those items which represent your personality .
For example , some people design their own clothes and they sew it too .
In this way , they represent originality just by using their creativity .
However , in most causes people are not satisfied with their shape and look .
It is often owing to wearing clothes which do not fit and suit them .
The latest fashion is often designed for slim persons , so it is recommend to choose the right ones .
To sum up , I believe there are pros and cons wearing the latest fashion .
The most significant thing is that it is not what makes you beautiful .
It 's inside that count .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
He ran over to his treehouse on the mountain , where he used to spend time himself or reading a book .
Two days before Peter received a letter of someone saying to meet her / him in the treehouse at 5 o'clock .
The treehouse was built by Peter 's father and it was their secret .
Two years ago , Peter 's father died so Peter was the only one that knew where was the treehouse .
So , who could have sent that letter ?
Peter ran and ran and when he arrived he saw the door opened .
He founded it strange because he always lock the door and the only people that had the keys was he and his father .
He came into the house and saw a man sitting on his father 's chair .
He shout " Who 's there ? " and suddenly the man turned over and the mystery man was Peter 's father and he said " I 'm proud that you have kept our secret .
See you later ... " .
Peter ran into his father 's arms but he disappeared and he promised himself that he never ever would tell anyone about the secret .
I do not think that no future for public transport because not all the people can have a car , especially , poor people in the developing country .
Moreover , there are places on long distance we can not travel by car , so we need a train or even a plane .
In addition , some people do not like travelling by their private cars on the highways because they fear the accidents .
But on the other hand , l agree to some extent that travelling by my private car is much more convenient .
I can travel at any time being restricted to specific times , as well as l can rest at any cafe to drink my favorite coffee .
I enjoy using GPS during travelling on my own to explore new places .
Consequently , we can not dispense with public transport , even if some of us would rather to use their private cars .
Some non - building areas , in some countries , are now occupying by housing and other residential buildings .
This would have some serious problems for both citizens and animals .
Human beings need more natural environment to live better and to ensure the living qualities .
Inhabits can go to countryside to have a pacnic or excursion with their friends or families to relax .
Ater natural areas , such as farmland , forest and wetland , are destroyed in large - scale , there is no close places with beautiful scenes to visit .
The consequence is that they are easily to get sick with modern buildings , which would influence their mental health , and even worse .
For animals , they are a part of nature , where is the home for them .
Without a pleasant place to live in , they are confronting extinction .
If their living areas are occupied by housing and other buildings , their source of food and water could be a serious problem .
As a result , some most vulnerable species will face to die out .
The large - scale building land are supporsed to be their home .
For governments , restriction on exploring human land is one of the ways to solve these problems .
Policmakers can enact a law in reducing land development .
Another method is that natural ecology gardens can be provided to those animals , like birds .
As long as there are some places for them to live , the natural ecology could be balanced .
In conclusion , a wide range of buildings and constructions can not only destroy our own living environment , but also that of animals .
Governments are responsible for changing this problems to achieve the harmony between man , nature and animals .

Save yourself

Maybe not !
There is a lot that you can do ...
This year I decided to clean the local forest with my family .
It will be very good to us , to the animals and to all the plants .
First , we thought that will be good to plant trees but it 's easier to make this .
Cleaning the forest is a fantastic idea because when the forests are cleaned , forest fires hardly happen .

Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .
She had a feeling that her birthday wo n't be oridinary .
For sure her friends were preparing a big surprise .
As far as she considered , she find out that she had a right .
Firstly , just after she had went into the school they greeted her with million colofull balloons with inscriptions with all the best wishes .
Then she had to go for class so every balloon was sent to the sky what made a beautiful view .
After she had finished her lessons , her boyfriend arrived on his motorcycle and took her for a nice trip .
Eventually they came to the lake on the suburbs and then she saw something unexceptable .
There was a big surprice - party in the forest .
Firstly she noticed only a big tranparent with a title " Happy birthday Anna ! "
and then it turned out that all her crew was there .
She heard the music and this is how the party stared .
It was really amazing day full of pleasures .
Anna would never forget it !
In my point of view I recommend you to stop going to sport classes , because I think music classes are better because you can also get a job in a orchesta or something like that .
Also you can work such an athletic and you can obtain a big amount of money but it 's also so difficult to get there and you have to be the best of them to earn a good amount of money .
So yes , I recommend you to carry on with your music classes but if you prefer to do sports I will support you also .
I do n't know which of them you like more but I am sure that you like one more than the other , so if you want to be a basketball player do n't give up with it .
I recommend you more the music classes but that 's your choice .
So that was my opinion about your problem and my recommendation but you are the one that have to take a decision , so good luck and remember to study also .
This project is a Historic Research on the relation between Euro and Denmark , to discover and understand the changes made by Denmark Institutions and Government as to adequate their social , economic and political system in relation with the new European currency .
With this research I want to discover if those changes helped Denmark protect itself from the European crisis .
The Danish measures will be also compared with other actions performed by European Countries like Italy .
This study project will be developed studying
-Danish and European historic documents and previous research about the Euro ;
-old and contemporary Danish journalistic articles ;
-Danish and European Institutions such as ECB , European Commission , Danish Ministry of Economy and Foreign Affairs , and it will be necessary to make and analyse interviews to Danish and European politicians , economists and experts of this historic and economic field .
The aim is to trace the new political , economic and social structure of Denmark in relation to the Euro and all its consequences .
To ensure safety wearing safety shoes is the most basic measure .
Besides , different training has different safety requirement .
For example , in the electro - pneumatic control training course , the operator must wear face mask when the machine is on to protect from hitting by the tube with high pressure air , likewise , it is also a necessary measure to start the machine after you are fully prepared with a face mask .
And the PLC controller 's wires have been protected by the insulated rubber everywhere except the connection point .
In addition , when operating the variable frequency drive ( VFD ) , it is necessary to set another separate emergency stop button , which is easy to be make out for unprofessional people in case of emergency .
" Your granddaughter must be born , with a curse that cause a scorn . Imperceptible she must become until she finds a love .
Two - sided it must be , or else she 'll disappear forever and a day . "
Ever since a curse was put opon Ailee 's grandmother , the girl has been living a daunting life .
A life , being unseen to humans eyes .
Ailee was banished to the forest at the age of 16 .
It was the curse that had made her life living next to the humans tough .
Whenever she was near any person , she would feel odious pain .
It stung her like there were a million needles inside her .
" The fate gives you a human that you can bear . "
But how to get a love when you are invisible ?
The curse has a good side which Ailee is enjoying a lot .
I watched a movie called The Help .
It was the story about black maids who worked for white families during 1960 's .
The movie was stoning , some of the plots were rather shocking .
It is hard to believe during the segregation time , black people were treated as a second - class citizen not only in real life but also in the constitution law .
The movie revealed the ironic reality and the ignorance and stupidity of some unkind people during the segregation time .
It also had some warm scenes , showing hope , courage and sacrifice .
Before I moved to Canada .
I did not know much about African - Americans ' history .
I had heard about slavery , discrimination , hate crimes against black people , but I did not know what really happened at that time .
Now from books , movies , I knew some of the most influence movements , I know Martin Luther King , Jr. was more than an activist and a public speaking man .
I knew the first person who ended the segregation at southern was a 9-year old girl .
It 's hard to imagine what they had been through during the civil rights movements .
It 's hard to put myself into their boat .
What if I was an African- American , what if I was born during the segregation time .
Would I be brave , determined ?
Would I hide behind crowds ?
I really do n't know .
It is really difficult to even think of .
As if I can not imagine if I were a heroin of one of the enormous heroic stories .
What would I do for my county .
I was born and raised in China , being a Chinese , it is our obligation to remember what Japanese soldiers had done to us during World War II .
We learned enormous heroic stories about how those heros scarified their lives for victory .
I have no idea why we had to learn those legends which were full of darkness , torture and violences .
It was the first day of Max 's School excursion to the Patagonia , they had arrive there yesterrday night but , today was the day they would actually go exploring .
They left early in the morning , everyone in the trip was very excited .
As soon as they got to the base of the mountain trail everyone filled up their water bottle and began walking .
Max was so anxiuos to see all the different kinds of wildlife .
Halfway through the trip Max heard a wierd noise close by and he decided to see what was going on , but before he knew it he was all alone .
The noise continued so he decided to see what was happening , As he turned the corner he found himself looking at a puma that was badly injured .
Max did nt know what to do .
Finally , he decided to go back to the class trip and let them know about the puma .
He followed the trail until final he was able to catch up to the class .
He went to the guide and told him about what he saw .
The guide decided to go with Max to the see the puma for himself .
When they got to the loction the guide decided to call the wildlife protection in that area to come help .
Once the wildlife protection were able to help the puma , everyone congratulated Max for his bravery and help .
Max coud not be happier . "
What and amazing day!",Max whispered to himself as he into bed that night .
The last documentary I saw was a documentary of National Geographic called Ocean .
It was about the life in the ocean and the consequences of climate change .
The first thing I learnt was that we are destroying the Earth and , especially , the oceans .
Every day , a lot of animals die due to all the rubbish we throw into the oceans .
The second thing I learnt was that we have to change the way of fishing because the fishermen kill a lot of aquatic animals , like dolphins or sea turtles , that they do n't want to kill .
This is because they drag nets along the seabed and catch all the animals that are swimming in it .
So overall I would recommend this documentary to everybody because all the people must know what we are doing with the Earth and they must learn to look after it because we only have one Earth and if we destroy it , we wo n't have any place where we can live .
I conduct group and individual training on Hatha Yoga and Thai Yoga ( Ruesi Dat Ton ) .
I am also a Therapeutic Thai massage professional .
All my yoga lessons and massage sessions are conducted in line with Correct Approach to Spine ( CAS ) method , so they are very safe and based on scientific reason .
Safety and knowledge of the body mechanic are very important to CAS vision as they give feeling of confidence and understanding to yoga practitioners .
I have more than 10 years of experience in the field of yoga and four years of teaching .
I had practised Ashtanga and Iyengar 's styles of yoga and Ruesi Dat Ton ( yoga of Thai hermits ) , learned different approaches during my training in India and Thailand , and my practice brought me to Classical Yoga - Correct Approach to Spine school , which way of exersising I found the safest , the most beneficial for health and scientifically grounded .
Because for me the practitioner 's safety is the one of the most important thing as ahimsa ( non harm ) is one of the crucial principles of yoga .
Renée Kwakkenbos
Dear Bruce ,
Thank you for your circular in which you explained your plans with the Warden Park .
My husband and I appreciated very much that you are receptive to new ideas .
As you know , we frequently visit your Health and Fitness Club .
The swimming pool is the favourite spot for building our condition .
Can you imagine that we were a bit disappointed when we read your plans to build a second sauna cabin beside the swimming bath ?
I hope you consider the kids in this plan !
For them ( or do I have to admit us ) , it should be a better idea to build a changing room with more space at that particular place .
In addition , your proposal to provide additional equipment for the gym and a wide screen TV for the snack bar did not get applause in our home .
The snack bar is our reward at the end of all our sweating , but I must apologize that sometimes we leave this place because of its long waiting times .
My recommend : do not hesitate to invest in a second microwave .
My last , but not least , advice is for the gym .
Maybe you can consider a bit renewing there with new classes , such as kickboxing .
Thank you once again that we were allowed to give our suggestions for you wonderful place .
If you ever do need more of these proposals , you can reckon us !
Kind regards ,
Dear Mr Smith :

Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Tom and his campaign
A few days ago , Tom saw on the newspaper an article that talked about the pollution that is produced by the cars and the effects that they would have in a few years .
This would cause a global warming causing the winter disappearance .
The same day he asked to his Science teacher if this would probably happen on a future .
The Science teacher explained to Tom all the problems that would provoke the global warming an he propose to Tom to do a campaign to raise about the use of the cars and the problems that would cause on a future .
To promote the campaign , Tom went to speak with the director and they put in agreement that all the kids of the school did a few placards with inspiring phrases to not use so much the cars and uses more public transport .
When Tom has arrived home , he has explained to their parents all related to the campaign and they have been very happy
It had been a very long day and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .

Home of the future will be definitely different from those in which we live currently .
Maybe the shape of homes will not change as much , as the internal .
For sure the main role in every home will play technology .
Everything will be working remotely , lightning , heating - probably there will be a possibility to programme everything by time , day , month and so on .
Keys wo n't be necessary anymore .
Doors will open by our voice , footprint or retina scan .
All appliances will be eco - friendly .
There will not be a home without air - conditioning anymore .
Room configuration and style will be somewhat different - more glazing , more open spaces .
Homes in general will be more airy .
The decor will be more modern and simpler .
The dominate colour will be white , but there will be some elements in more vivid colours .
Main materials will be plastic and metal .
Unfortunately we ca n't know that for one hundred percent .
We 'll see with ours own eyes in twenty , maybe fifty years .

As I think , learning likes a weapon for any individual which enables him to be like a champion .
Nelson Mandela said , " Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world " .
Learning has no end , We spend all of our lives learn from circumstances we face .
Learning not only means to study in schools , universities , etc .
But it means to improve your skills , your talents .
Nowadays , you have a lot of ways to learn and be better in your life and your career .
For example , one of these ways is the Internet .
You can use it to learn any language or take courses in any field from your home during weeks or months as you can , which named self - study .
This can be easy only when you are determined to achieve what you want .
Always remember that , " Education is what remains after one has forgotten what he has learned in school " Albert Einstein said .
This composition is about the famous person from my country .
This humble and famous man is called Kinta Kenneth .
I choose this man because he was a significant player during the slave trade .
He fought for the liberation of slavery in West Africa .
He put the Gambia on the world map .
The Gambia is visited by many tourist because of him .
This has led to many black Americans to visit the Gambia for investment purposes .
Kinta Kenneth was a captured slave from Naima Juffera .
He was captured while hunting with his colleagues in the forest .
This was in 1879 during the slave trade period .
Kunta was captured because he was trying to rescue his friend who was lost in the forest .
He can across the slave master in the mouth of the river Gambia while looking for his friend .
He ran away from them but they later captured him with their dogs .
Kunta was sold to slave master in South America .
He works very had in the sugar plantation for the slave master .
While in capture , he fought the rights of all the black slaves in the campus .
He refused to work more than eight hours a day and he refused to take orders from the slave master .
He was refused with food but he kept going with his strike .
He was later given the opportunity to learn English language .
He attends the same class with other relatives of the slave masters .
He did very well during their exam and was given another opportunity to teach English to other slaves .
He was famous and respectful in the slave Campus .
But was later betrayed by his slave masters .
He organised demonstrations which turned out to abolishment of slavery .
He died during the demonstration .
But his name was written by all western nation newspaper as the brave man .
Because of his efforts that lead to the abolishment of slavery and the freedom for captured slave in the campus .
The Gambia is well known by the adventurers and the tourist .
The history of Kunta Kinta is part of our national history .
The stature of Kinta is situated in the entrance of Banjul .
Kunta was not only a great man in the Gambia but a hero .
Public transport is a public medium to bring people from one place to another .
In this era , there are many types of public transport using by people , for example : bus , train , monorail , light - rail - transit ( LRT ) , taxi , and so on .
Most people using a public transport to go to their workplace and travelling around the city .
Some of the workers choosing to use public transport than their own cars .
This is because they want to avoid the traffic block .
Mostly , they are more preferring to use public transport than the car because it can avoid the traffic block and save time to get into their workplace earlier .
It is also can save the money as the price of the ticket of public transport is cheaper compared to oil cost by using the car .
Through all of these points , it is not faulty to say that is the public transport still available and very useful in our daily life , even there are a lot types of cars , which are more convenient .
so , there will be a future for public transport because of its own benefits or advantages to human society .
It is very friendly transportation where the people from all places , meet in one transport and they can make a relationship between them .
Additionally , the pollution , such as haze , will be decreased because fewer people using the car .
As a conclusion , there is a future for public transport and it also convenient to use it for travelling .
We will not have to worry about where to find a park for the car and we can enjoy the trip .
Dear sir or madam ,

I 'm not a sportsman , I like watching basketball , tennis , football , but my favorite sport is the running .
A lot of people like it , because I think so , it is the cheapest sport .
We need only an amazing runnigshoes , and that 's all , ok ... ,
we need at least 45 minute , per day , or at least 3 times a week .
I love this sport !
For me it is like a meditation . I can think about everything , or nothing .
This is my decision .
It is very good for the circulation , the running helps me to be in good shape .

Go every second day , run in your own rhythm , and the next week you can do more ! ... and a day you will run a half marathon , and you will be strong , fresh and so confident , like never before !
I have the pleasure to give this essay to Ms .
Eliot , my special English teacher .
The restaurant I would love to review for the class is one of the most popular restaurants located just near the downtown plaza .
It is called the ' Egyptian Cuisine ' and its name actually represents what it has to offer .
It offers a delicious Egyptian menu which provides enough dishes to cover all tastes , as an example , their delicious fresh eggplant traditional salad .
If there is anything that favors this restaurant , it has to be the quantity they serve ; a surely efficient quantity along the truly special quality leaves this restaurant as one of the best in town , if not in the whole country .
What about the amazing eccentric atmosphere they have to offer ; with a soulful live band and an elegant dining set , their atmosphere adds up to the flavor of their food .
In addition to that , they will be able to offer a connected table that could fit ht whole class , professionally named , the meeting table .
To come to the point .
This restaurant has to be the right choice for two reasons ; firstly it offers a traditional menu which will ensure to cover all different tastes .
Secondly , the lively atmosphere it offers will surely keep the class entertained during the entire dine - in .
At the end of my essay , I would like to devote this paragraph and thank my wonderful teacher for this opportunistic chance to offer my sincere opinion on the topic .
Many thanks and I hope for a wonderful trip regardless of the restaurant voted for .
My first day at ACU came to me as a surprise .
In the very first class , I was asked questions by the teacher .
It was a very different experience to learning in Korea .
It was not only the first class that I had to speak out in class .
Although it was not easy to get used to such teaching style , it did not take long for me to realise what teachers were expecting from us and why they were doing so .
Participation in class by asking and answering to questions demands more active thinking from us .
Nobody would argue the significance and effectiveness of modern technology , having revolutionised all spheres of human lives by providing a great number of remarkable virtues , such as massproduction , information and communication devices as well as medical and scientific breakthroughs .
However , it has also posed some alarming issues , namely environmental destruction , and increasing unemployment and health concerns .
This essay will attempt to analyse both sides of this controversial phenomenon with some applicable supporting ideas .
To begin with , evidently , technological progress has noticeably enhanced individuals'quality of lives , controbuting to the economic growth of numerous nations .
To illustrate , machineries and the use of fertilisers in agriculture have helped to develop massproduction and raise the availability and quantity of various types of food , having made them cheaper and more affordable .
My favourite sport is a Tamil sport known as Kabadi .
I believe many of us do not have a faintest idea about this sport .
At the outset , let me tell you about this sport and how it is played .
It is played in a box drawn on the ground in the size of a volleyball court .
A centre line parts the box and a line is drawn inside each box about 2 feet from the line which ends the box , and this line is called proudly as Ellai kodu(Border Line)in Tamil .
There will be 2 teams and each team consists of 6 players and the players assume the border line as their own border .
This makes the game war - like and very special to Tamils .
Rules of engagement are quite simple .
The first and most important rule is you do not let the opponent player who raids your field(the box)to touch your border(Border Line).The second rule is You do not let the opponent to cross over the ' No men 's land'(The centre line),when the opponent touches the Border of your's .
The opponent must raise a leg when the other one touches the border to tell them " Lo , I am in your territory".If the opponent touches the border , he can retreat to his field , no shame in that , but he do n't get any points .
But before retreating , if he touches anyone among them and leaves their field without getting caught , then The raider gets a point and the person who was touched by the raider is dead(Out ) .
Each team gets opportunity to raid other 's field alternatively , and the first one to raid is decided by the toss of a coin , as usual as in most games .
A number is decided to count the dead ones and which team reaches that number first loses the game to the another .
Rules are pretty simple but the game is quite tough , you'll hurt yourself really bad .
It takes a day to count the scratches on your body after the game .
But that is the reason Tamils enjoy the game and they cherish it .
Why on earth do they love slits , scratches and scars!Are they sick ?
One can wonder , but we can find the reason in their Sangam Literature , written circa 300 BCE .
It says the bravery of men is reckoned by the number of scars on his body except on his back , because they thought to be dead in the field is far better than retreating .
There are accounts to say about a woman who cut her breast because she found her son 's body pierced by a long narrow spear - like weapon in his back rather in the chest .
So I like this game because it reflects the Tamil culture 's important value which is giving high rank to bravery .
I love to play the game with my friends in my village , a very refreshing game , I would say .
no exams or wedding or the first day of school ,
one of my most ecxiting day of my life was the 23rd august 2014 .
it can be very strange but i was very exited , because ,
on this date the BBC released the new series of Doctor who ...
It is a popular English science fiction and it tales about the adventures of the " Doctor " .
the Doctor is an alien from the planet Gallifrey and he travels in all of time and space with his companions that are normally humans . in his experiences he saved whole planets to other bad aliens .
I think Doctor Who is totally different from other science fiction films , it always has done the unthinkable , the impossible , things that no one else has even dreamed of .
Doctor 's travelsmachine is a Policebox ... it is small and blue outside , but it is bigger on the inside .
I like Doctor Who very much . I always dream to travel everywhere in time and space since I was a little child ! ! !
! if,(one day)I will have the possibilty to do it I will go to distant galaxies and I will see how the universe began .
in my opinion this serie was wonderful and , i hope for the next one !

Emily knew she would have to come to a decision soon .
The Headmaster had asked his school 's teachers to begin a class in English and she was one of them .
The big question was if she would have been able to engage herself in this new activity .
She was trying to improve her English skills since September by taking an English course , but she had felt herself still unready to keep a whole math topic using this language with the Clil method , because she was placed to the B2 level in reading and listening while in speaking and writing the level she had joined doing a specific test was only the B1 .
After thinking a lot about the positives and negatives aspects of this question , refers also to the quality of hers teaching methods and the time she had to spend preparing the math topics in English , Emily decided to accept the challenge and to engage herself in this new adventure .
When I think about The Home of the Future , I can see a lot of new things that could simplify my daily life .
I think that people will live more ecologically .
In The Home of the Future everybody will segregate waste and take care of environment .
People will have the device that extinguish the light when we leave the room .
We will have furniture that do not stain .
We also discover flowers that irrigate themselves and machine that walk a dog or wash them when we do not have enough time to do this .
We will all have vacuum cleaners that will dust everything without our knowledge .
Kitchen will be different too .
We will have equipment that will prepare meals for us with only one pressing a button .
Then we wo n't dream about great , Italian spaghetti because our stove will do it better than every Italian cook .
That is the kind of house that I want to resident in twenty years .
The answer on this question depends on the fact in which place you live .
If the place of your happy living is relatively large city , you will say indeed : " We obviously need public transport ! Everyone knows what happens on the streets in rush time ?
You can get stuck in traffic jam for hours ! " .
It seems that if people did not move yourself only in their beautiful cars and take a bus or metro , the air would be clearer , the city would become less noisily etc .
On the other hand , if you live in a small town or village , your answer is : " Of course , I prefer my own car or bicycle to public transport , if I do n't go far away .
I have more ideas where to travel by car , as public transport 's routes are "
On your attitude to public transportation highly affects the quality of public transport itself .
I mean a timetable punktuality , time interval to tne next bus and so on .
At last , how big the crowd are in the bus or subway car in rush time , how convenient for yourself to be there , rather than sitting in your own air - conditioned and perfect looking car .
That is all I would like to say at this point .
" Resolution number one : Obviously will lose twenty pounds . Number two : Always put last night 's panties in the laundry basket .
Equally important , will find sensible boyfriend to go out with and not continue to form romantic attachments to any of the following : alcoholics , workaholics , commitment phobic 's , peeping toms , megalomaniacs , emotional fuckwits or perverts .
And especially will not fantasize about a particular person who embodies all these things "
- Helen Fielding , Bridget Jones 's Diary
I was always fascinated by this American tradition to make a resolution list .
It was something new to me and that 's why attracted me so much .
The idea of writing a blog triggeredmy mind as well .
The first step to it was my diary after visiting Sochi with my friend in 2000 .
I had a copybook where I wrote some interesting facts about that remarkable trip for me .
Since then I have been dreaming about collecting my impressions and memories .
As my sister constantly says You 're lucky because you have a memory of a goldfish You remember absolutely nothing .
It took me much to admit this again fact .
In contrast to my sister ( she has an extraordinary memory ) I forget everything easily and keep looking for new emotions and adventures .
A year ago an idea of beginning a blog encountered me as advice from an English teacher .
He recommended me to write in order to apply my English knowledge .
Well … .
Maybe it 's really time to make a resolution and do begin writing it .
I 'm going to kill two birds with one stone - my blog will help me to collect my memories and master my English The third bird will be my hatred to writing .
I hate writing since school .
It was a family tragedy when I got a task to write a composition for my literature class .
Such tasks made my family busy for an evening and anyway I always had a poor mark .
So my dear blog ( I heard it 's the way I have to interact with it ) You will be about nothing .
good
She : I decided my blog will be about nothing .
Just a blog ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
He : lol I think I will win :P you wo n't be able to write about nothing for very long :)
She : sure .
I have so much nothing in my head to write about
Let 's get started !
To ,
Manager
Date : November 6 , 2015
Dear Sir / Madam ,
With humbly and respectfully , I would like to inform you and your organization that I am the appropriate candidate to you .
I have recently finished my undergraduate program .
Which is in sport management and also have experience of kitchen work .
I have complete 6 months vocational cookery course .
I do part - time job at school hostel as a teacher .
I am 24 years old young male , love to do challenging task .
I am the best candidate for your job to execute high result of excellence .
If there are any possible options then please give it to me .
It will be my great pleasure to bond with you and your organization .
If you could give me a chance to working with you and your organization , it will be a great pleasure for me .
looking forward to hear from you .

Pradip Anand Khatri
The future .
No one can tell how it will be like .
The cosmic era , communications , easy access to the Internet - all of these things will become common in the distant future .
According to these changes people will change , their way of life will as well .
For example , the spread of IT technologies will change economics and the financial system .
People will start purchasing all the items from the Internet .
New methods of transportation may speed up the delivery to the purchaser home and , as a result , it will improve the quality of service .
The new communication networks will transform the whole world into the big village where everyone will be able to make contact any person .
The development of the space technologies and companies connected to construction of the spacecraft may give a start to space tourism .
The Earth orbit , the Moon , maybe Mars - all will be much closer to mankind and there will be another great leap for it .
I hope I will see such future .
I hope it will be real for me to see how humans will land on Mars , how this will become popular .
I believe that the public transport does n't have future because travelling by car is so much more convenient and comfortable .
When you travel in your own car you do n't have to wait a specific time and you can go somewhere but when you travel in public transport you must wait to the time when the public transport could catch you .
I think that is the main problem , but you can also change where you are going to .
In public transport you must go to the points in the route .
The seats are more comfortable in a car than in a bus or underground .
That 's why I prefer Travelling by car instead of public transport .
My dear John ,
I am very glad to read this good news , it is the first step for the final result and I will try to do my best to give you useful information for your interview .
But before that , it is important that you have a general idea about my company ; its business and goals .
It opened more than twenty years ago and still now is the leader of chimical sector .
Remember this is fundamental for each interview .
The day of the event dress not to formal but also not to informal .
Try to be spontaneus and not too much sliced .
Also , it is nice to see polite and smile person .
Do not talk too much is a sympton of anxiety .
The first part of the interview is mainly about your private life and study .
Maybe you can receive some general information about your last job .
Do n't worry about people who will interviews you .
I worked in that staff more than ten years ago ( new employees recruiments ) and I can guarantee that for the first interview it is important only to receive a good impression .
If you 'll do it ( and I 'm sure you will give it ) you 'll receive another appointment .
I hope to have said everything .
When you come here send me a text .
It will a great pleasure to have a coffee together .
Good luck for the future .
Recently I have seen " Prisoners " , a great thriller .
This film is about a kidnapping of two little girls .
Everyone in the village try to find the children .
The main character is the father of one of the children .
The man is really frightened and this situation gets him more and more desperate and he can not control his reactions .
I enjoyed this film a lot because it attracts your attention all the time .
In my opinion it is so really exciting because you are constantly thinking where the girls are or who can be the kidnaper .
I would recommend " Prisoners " to the student film club because it has the features that you want .
I believe that if you are looking for an interesting thriller , this thriller is the correct one .
However , there is a problem and it is that the film shows much violence and it should not be seen by children , only by teenagers or older people .
At any case , in my opinion it is a great film which many people would enjoy if they see it .
We have always been trying to find our origins .
We want to know and understand what is happening nowadays and , for this reason , it is important to know what happened before .
As the way I see it , to find the origin of languages can be similar to know our own family tree .
Because that can give us a lot of new information about us that we did n't know .
On the one hand it can be funny to imagine and create the story of how everything happened formerly .
But on the other hand , we can have too much imagination and to be disappointed with the truth .
That always depends on what we were expecting for .
In my opinion , there are so many things we have to discover yet , and much more we left back as we progress .
Consequently , it will be a constantly research on the field of our origins .
My favourite sport is not a sport as you may think of it .
Most people who do sport want to be fit and stay healthy .
Sport is connected with moving a lot in any case .
My favourite sport is different .
Well , it keeps my fit , but not my body in the first case , it 's good for my brain .
I play Skat .
Skat is an old German card game .
You play it with 32 cards and you need 3 or 4 people who are able to play it .
I enjoy playing it so much because it 's really challenging .
Every game is different .
There are so many opportunities which card to lay and which colour is trump .
Secondly , the people you play with are very different too .
I know a builder who plays very well and a professor who - mh - so to speak - still needs some more practice .
I also teach childring at the age of 10 or 11 how to play it .
My husband and me play in two clubs .
If you are very good , you can take part in competitions .
There are German championships every year and there is a league , too , where teams of 4 play against each other .
and of course , people play Skat in pubs and win some chops of meat .
I hope you can imagine how much I like my hobby .
I really ca n't understand why chess is considered to be sport and Skat is n't .
It helps me to stay fit and makes me forget all the worries and stress of my work days .
When it comes to helping communities , people hold different attitudes toward whether young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities or not .
Some people think young people spend enough time to help their communities ; however , others disagree with the idea .
Although young people are required to help their communities every week , actually it is still not enough .
It is true that young people are required to help their communities by their schools or companies .
It is also true that these kinds of requirements really work , and many communities are benefited .
Actually , there are many communities still do not receive enough help , or many social issues and events would not be discussed again and again .
Many reasons result in this phenomenon .
The world becomes more and more competitive , young people have to spend much time to cultivate themselves to survive in this society .
Young people are not only have to spend much time to make them be professional in one specific subject , they also have to know a wide range of knowledge .
For example , to be outstanding to enter to the best university , student have to perform well on their curriculum , such as literature and science , they also have to be good at music or doing exercise .
Therefore , they do not have much time to help their communities .
The salaries are not good nowadays .
To survive in the era of inflation of price , young people have to get more than one jobs .
They have to do full time job at day time , and have a part time job at night .
Needless to say , if young people have to take care of their parents or children , they have to make more money .
Still , young people do not have much spare time .
To sum up , the world nowadays makes young people to survive by themselves , and they do spend much time to help others .
The Shakespeare 's path to Russia was rather thorny .
This is not surprising .
While William Shakespeare wrote his plays and made the Thespian art to flourish in England , in Russia was very dim and sinister period of Ivan IV the Terrible 's reign .
So , in Russian print the name of Shakespeare is mentioned first in 1748 .
First translations appear in the end of 18th century , but this is not Shakespeare actually because they are made from German or French and the translators change plots as they want ( and turn them into some tearjerkers as a rule ) .
For example , in one of the " Hamlet " translations the main subject of the play turns out to be the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia and Ophelia in a meantime appears to be a daughter of Claudius ( obviously to make Hamlet torture 's completely unbearable ) .
It is close to unbelievable , but at first critics and educated people find Shakespeare rude , unpoetic and unpatriotic ( shame on you , blind and narrow - minded people !
Once more into the breach ! ) .
But everything changes quite rapidly then .
The first accurate translation of Hamlet from the original is published in 1828 .
By 1855 only six plays has left non - translated .
It comes to fashion and becomes honorable to translate Shakespeare .
Russian society gradually begins appreciating Shakespeare 's skill in portraying greatness , depth , and complexity of a human being .
" The sun of Russian poetry " , Alexander Pushkin takes his English lessons for the sake of being able to read Shakespeare .
And his drama Boris Godunov is certainly inspired by Macbeth .
In the poetical drama Masquerade by other famous Russian poet Mikhail Lermontov we clearly read Othello 's features .
And these are like nodes on the tree of Shakespeare 's genius .
Since that time Shakespeare has been one of our favorite artists .
We love his simplicity and veracity , we adore his multiplicity and fantasy , we appreciate his straightness and audacity , we prize his delicacy and his funny bone of course !
The surprise of the weekend
First , I want to explain to you what happened to me on Saturday morning . I had to meet up with my friend Matus at 14 am when he told me that he could n't come over that if we could meet up later how you can understand he made me so angry because I ca n't put up this kind of person who who is in late always .
On Saturday morning I had to working and I had to do all the things as fast as was possible to be in the city centre at the exact time .
The worst part of story was when he told me that he was going to have a lunch with his friends .
I got cold feet I could n't understand what was happening .
I was supposed to we were going to have a lunch together but he was going to come later .
Despite all I tried to calm myself down and I went to the library until laura came to town .
During the afternoon I tried to keep my smile all the time because I did n't fancy going explain what was wrong with me .
Finally yesterday at night , I was studying in my room when the doorbell rang I went to opened the door and outside was , my friend Matus .
This fact took me by surprise .
He wanted to explain to me what was the problem .
At the beginning I did n't want to talk with him but on second thought all people deserve a second chance .
All in all , He apologized and at the end everything is solved
We go on being friends .
Hello , my name is Sebastian and I will talk about Azul Historico , which is a restaurant in Mexico City .
The restaurant location is in the street Isabela Católica number 30 , suburb Centro Historico in Mexico City .
Azul Historico is a different restaurant and is located in a patio of an old building in the zocalo , the type of architecture of the place is colonial and between the tables are some trees , and this trees covers the diners when they are eating .
When you are eating you can look some birds who are in the trees , so it make unusual and different this restaurant than others .
The service are good , the waiters serve excellent , the food is delicious , but some periods of the year the place is full of people and you need a reserve or wait a long time for a table .
The cost of the restaurant dishes is expensive and the cost is around 150 - 300 pesos .
It is so difficult to choose three best dishes of the place but these three are some of the best typical food of Mexico : the " Cochinita Pibil " , " Chichilo Negro " and " Carne Enchipoclada " .
" Carne Enchipoclada " you need to choose the meat ( pork tenderloin , beef steak or deer meat ) and it is accompanied by a sauce of chile chipotle with potatoes cambray . "
Chichilo Negro " is a dish and you need to choose some of the three type of meat that I said , but this are accompanied by a combination of 7 different types of moles originating of oaxaca and the last dish is the typical " Cochinita Pibil " of Mexico .
If you want a different and unique restaurant you need to go Azul Historico , because it has a delicious food , some times have a regional music and the service are excellent .
If we consider the potentiality of this means of communication , the television would be one of the most important invention of this last century .
On the other hand , despite the numerous documentaries , news and cultural programs which are passed on every day , another fact that must be considered is the incredible amount of the so - called rubbish TV , which has been impacting badly on the younger generation , and the extreme violence of some movies transmitted even during times that should be considered as a protected band for children .
Furthermore I should probably mention the enormous amount of advertisements that every single day people are forced to watch once they have switched on this box .
In my opinion , the real problem of this potentially useful tool is due to the fact that television is essentially a passive means of communication .
As a matter of fact televiewers are not able to decide the palimpsest , but they still can decide to switch the television off .
Over the past years , humans have renewed and improved scientific progress and this causes a big change in the life of every day .
First , technology has radically changed the daily life of a simple family : computer seems to be necessary and in every house there is more TV than one .
Conversely , with the latest medical discoveries , doctors are able to treat many of the world 's diseases .
Finally , with the exploitation of new renewable energy , humans have an infinite source of energy .
Well , there are a lot of different opinions but I 'm not agree that the effects of scientific progress may be dangerous for the individual .

Nowadays there are a lot of different forms of conditioning that deeply influence people so that they feel the need to buy specific brands of items , object , cars and so on .
For example , every day we are invaded by facts form news on TV but it very often happens that some information are left in the background whereas less important information are spread in their place .
Similarly , on TV , during the shows , between a programme and the other we are bombed by the same ads all the time .
For this reason , I think that every day we are continuously surrounded by with information , news , advertising so that we do n't have enough time to think what is really important and what we really need in our life and we can all be influenced very easily .

The film I would like to review is an old film I 've always enjoyed : Young Frankenstein directed by Mel Brooks in 1974 .
This comedy , entirely shot in black and white , is a parody of the classical horror films , in particular it 's a parody of those films based on the Mary Shelley 's better - known book , and presents a lot of elements that gives this film a really hilarious mark .
The performance of Gene Wilder , as the main character Dr Frankenstein , Marty Feldman , as the hunchbacked assistant Igor ( pronounced eye - gore ) , and the other members of the cast is amazing and has made Young Frankenstein one of the top comedy of all time .
Dear Sirs / Madams
I am writing because I would like to achieve the First Certificate in English ( FCE ) .
I tried three times to pass this exam but I failed .
Do you run a course which prepared for this difficult exam for me ?
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully
There are many different types of music in the world today .
Why do we need music ?
Is the traditional music of a country more important than the International music that is heard everywhere nowadays ?
Music is a special world .
It has it 's own rules , tools and the people who are specialized in it .
Over decades music is the eternally art which develop day by day .
We need music in most of our times or even every single day , to enrich our days with happiness and joy , and also to melt away sorrows or depression , that can affect us and prevent ourselves from doing the best .
Music is a science ! yes it is .
Which has many branches and types , those are traditional : owned by any part of the world , and the other international types that all people over the world are share it .
The traditional or local music of a certain area has it 's thumb print on the person of that part .
And the instruments used in that local music may vary from sort to another .
Because the people tend to make it from their own basic culture .
For example , In Northern Sudan people have been used " Tambor " as a traditional spiritual tool for their songs .
Internationally , the kinds of music are many , however , most of them share the same instruments .
In particular the Piano is a universal tool that is used by many musicians as a primary controller of the rhythm of the Orchestra .
Last and not the least , music is a sort of treatment to those who are suffering , so regardless of it 's type or nationality it 's a kind of medicine to the soul .
And I enjoy it very much .
The prohibition and destruction of books has occurred in historical periods as the inquisition , the knowledge was manipulated by the powerful social statements such as the Catholic Church and monarchies since the knowledge through books had become a threat to continue underpinning their power within the social pyramid ; therefore , those powerful social statements chose what books did not violate their thought in order to transcribe them .
Although , some ideas were maintained ; ( for instance , the astronomy by Galileo Galilei ) the book - burning caused a delay in the knowledge because if books were burned , the knowledge could not circulate .
Nevertheless , a knowledge revolution was created with the invention of the printing mobile types by Gutenberg ( 1440 ) due to it element gave access to the knowledge recovering significant books from Plato , Aristotle and so on , authors against political , religious and social issues that spread their ideas to more people becoming aware of the power of the written word , creating social revolutions such as the French and American ones .
In addition , it was produced the collective readings through the ecclesiastical method with the purpose of disseminating the knowledge embodied in the books to all social classes .
On the other hand , at present , people identify another knowledge revolution , the internet in which the access to the knowledge is easier and faster leaving aside books .
From the above , as far as I am concerned , when Franklin Rosemont argues that " books can not be killed by fire .
People die , but books never die " it depends on the historical time and the technical revolution of this time taking into account that that knowledge uprising is always accompanied by a technical revolution which supports the entrance of the information ; for instance , in the inquisition , the knowledge was limited because it was embodied in books .
Although there was an oral tradition , the knowledge was accommodated to the political and religious thought of the speaker ; so , the most efficient and objective way to transmit the knowledge was by books and it was not possible because of the burning .
Nonetheless , with the invention of the printing type mobile , the knowledge was different for the access to it .
If one book was burned , there were ten books more without restriction .
In contrast , nowadays , the books are not necessary at all ; because of the internet network facilitate even more the knowledge .
That is why ; I could accommodate the phrase by Franklin saying that " the knowledge can not be killed by people because the knowledge is infinite . "
On actual days what we most need is to find ways to prevent childhood obesity because nowadays is a very common sickness that attack more and more children everyday causing them feel bad about themselves .
According to the CDC the percentage of children age 6 to 11 years old has increased from 7% to about 18% in 32 years on the Unitated States .
This means that in the past tree decades obesity has more than doubled in children , same that had diseases just like diabetes , ashtma , cardiovascular risk factors , mental health disorders and muskuloskeletal problems .
This disease is not just about all the physical and health consequences that have , but also the mental ones .
A lot of kids grow with a different way to think just because the damage that the little ones can cause , one example can be the famous " bullying " , the principal way that kids use to annoy the ones that looks different .
The best way we can prevent childhood obesity is recommending all the families some different doctor that can help them to give a safe life to their children .
Nutritionist are specialists that know a lot about all the types of sickness that can attack on the kids and even the ones that will murder them .
Giving them the opportunity to take care about your situation will change all your life in a good way .
They might be there for you , preparing menus and a big extension of exercises that will help you and change your health and body only if you cooperate .
Nowadays a part of the people buy a lot of things that they do n't need .
In this essay we are talking about above all with rich people .
So money , today , are really important in our life and in this case rich people are very lucky .
They have much money to buy things that they need , and things that they do n't need .
So it seems that these people can live happily and peacefully , without problems , but this is not true .
In fact above all about rich families the children are in trouble with their family , above all when they have their parents separated .
Also most of the children grow up spoiled because of the large amount of money of their family , and they grow up with the thing that they want more and more things .
But in the other side there are poor people that aspire to become rich .
And these people do n't have money for things that they do n't need and also for things that they need .
So in this case the money are more important than other things .
So in my opinion today we ca n't live without money , but we have to consider more to feel good with your family and with yourself .

Dear Mrs Sykes ,

I think that 50 years ago people could n't even imagine what the life would be like in our time .
Today , human civilisation is changing at a higher speed than any time in the past .
If this will also be the case for out future , then I think that today we underestimate our future .
I am sure only about one thing : technologies will have a more important place in our lives .
Maybe in 50 years people wo n't work as we do now , instead will build only robots .
Maybe in 50 years we will find out how our brain works and we will be able to create an artificial intelligence system that would solve all our problems .
I would like to think that in the future we will explore more the universe and we will colonise other planets .
Maybe by doing this we would be able to find other civilisations and exchange technologies with them .
I 'd like to think that we will find a method to travel through the universe at the higher speeds than the speed of light .
I do n't think that people will live forever in 50 years , but I hope that the life of our children will be better than ours .
Hopefully , I have chances to be alive in 50 years , so maybe I will see the future with my own eyes .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
That morning his grandmother went to the hospital because she had to do a surgery and she told him to buy some magazines for her , because at the hospital she 's bored and she could n't get off the bed for a few days .
His mother was working and his dad was out of town and that 's why she asked him to make her that favour and he could n't say no .
So Peter went home to take his wallet but before that he decide to take a nap because he was tired so he started to sleep but it ended up that he slept for over 3 hours and his mother started calling him at the telephone and she was really angry because he forgot to buy the magazines for his grandmother .
So he woke up and looked at his watch and knew that he had to buy them immediately or his mother would be even more angry than before .
He took his wallet and then he ran to buy the magazines and after that he went to the hospital to give them to his granny .
Unfortunately the hospital was already closed to the visitors so he had to wait the next morning .
A FANTASTIC FUTURE
Will transport be different in the future ?
Certainly it will be .
But how ?
If we think about the future , some sketches of famous movies could come to our mind .
For example , we could think about some odd cars that can fly or become invisible .
But I do n't think that in ten or twenty years the scientific progress will be able to produce this type of transport , so we should imagine something simpler .
Actually , in my opinion , in the future there will be faster transport .
In addition , means of transport will be able to produce less pollution .
Even if nowadays people do n't use public transport , in the future they will .
And how will our way of travelling change ?
In the future everyone will be able to go on holiday all around the world since the transport will be faster and cheaper .
To sum up , I think that means of transport in the future will make our life easier , both when we have to go to work or to school and when we want to travel .
Transport will also respect the environment and nature .
Do n't you think that this future is fantastic ?
since decades man preferred to use another way of transporting than his own foot .
In my opinion , that was the main reason for wheel invention .
Scientists could provide in the past years new transportation tools from cycles , automobiles up to motorcycles , motorcars , trains , metros that has been used to arrange and accomplish complete public transportation net through the same country , and sometimes exceeded it to another country boarder upon an agreement between those countries .
Many people assured that they are preferring using their own cars , but they were being forced to use the Public transport for many reasons such as , the complexities they are facing with the driver 's license , in addition to the fuel high cost .
They were more likely forced than having choosing it as an option .
Let 's do n't forget the hard times during cold weather changes especially in winter while reaching the bus stations , or their low chances of having a good place to sit , may be another important reason that raise the private transport scores than the public one , which is molestation .

Dear Paul ,
I am writing to tell you about the concert .
Last month , I enjoyed helping at the Rainbow concert .
The aim of this concert was to show that all children are the same .
I was invited to help at a concert by my English teacher .
I did a lot to make this concert better .
My teacher asked me to find some songs about rainbows and extracts from the books about children .
Moreover , I went to Vilnius primary school and invites schoolchildren to come to a concert .
I had to make one hundred invitation cards .
The cards included the programmee of the concert and some photos of children from all the world .
I was really excited about it .
It is a very good and useful experience .
I gained a lot of experience while organizing an event .
Also , I learned that you have to be very enthusiastic and self - confident because finding the sponsors for a concert is quite a difficult task I liked that teacher trusted me .
I did everything by myself because everyone had sometihng to do on their own .
I hope that I will use this experience in my future .
See you soon ,
Rasa
I live in Kiev for two years .
I went many times to different places that I had n't known yet .
And now I can easily speak about many shopping facilities in my city .
So , let 's begin .
To start with , you must decide , what kind of shopping do you prefer and how much money you have .
If you want to go to the cheap shopping , you have to go to the Teremky .
You can find many shops there with second - hand clothes you taste .
There are many good things from Asia , America and Europe , of course .
If you have enough money for Kiev luxury shopping called ' gold shoppping ' , you 'd rather go on Khreshatik street .
You can also find many shops with brand , expensive clothes from well - known world designers .
I like to go shopping there with my best friends at the weekend .
I often buy second - hand old - fashioned jeans , skirts , trousers , jackets and shoes .
I think it is very good for students , if you want to save your money .
In conclusion I have to say , that in Kiev you can find everything , if you really want to .
So , good luck .
Art / Music is less important than science / technology .
In my opinion , technology become more and more important than art which be a necessary part in our life .
Most of people in this world ca n't live without technology .
As soon as we open our eyes every day , we begin to use technology such as alarm , cell phone and light .
The more technology we use the more important it is .
Technology makes us easy to connect our family , friends and co - workers .
We can talk to our family and friends immediately , which is not limited by space .
I can call my dad who live in New York now then call my friend living in Norway after first call .
Therefore , if I studied abroad fifty years ago , I could n't call my family directly and it is also not an easy job .
However , technology made it easier ten years ago and it became more common in recent years .
It ca n't believe that we keep in touch with our family and friends not only voice and message but also video call , now .
Technology is one of important part in our life , which has made life more convenient .
Before computer was born in this world , we used paper to list something which we should afford it could disappear or be ruined by something .
Therefore , we use calculator to count numbers in a few second .
In the old age we calculated number by our brain that might lead to some mistakes .
Our life has transformed into an easy way by technology .
Besides , the grandest invention is Internet .
I sit in front of my computer and I acquire news around the world .
If I am hungry , I could order some delicious foods online .
As a person said ' ' Sitting near a computer , you will get the world . ''
It is easier to contract entertainment which could release our stress immediately .
In modern world , stress always disturb our life .
Pressure exist everywhere ; for instance , your boss was angry and shouted on you or you should carefully deal with the relationship between you and your father - in - law .
When you ca n't breathe in your life you need some entertainment ; for example , you can listened music with your cellphone or watched some funny videos after all things that bothered you .
It lower our blood pressure and release our stress .
Technology enable us to touch entertainment immediately .
Technology has changed our life in many ways which brings many advantages for us such as convenience , easy to connect friends and easier to contract entertainment .
In conclusion , in these three premises I consider that technology and science is important rather than art and music .
Science practical improve our life .
Have you read any sport magazine before ?
There are a lot of magazines in many fields of sports .
In magazine , they are telling us we can see a lot of games no matter where we are .
Developed technology , we can see the game which happened in the opposite of the earth .
Time and place are n't matter for people to watch the game .
Everybody has a favorite sport .
Soccer is the one of the famous sport for many people .
World cup has been the world famous festival .
People can enjoy just seeing the soccer game and they are eager to root for their favorite team .
Why the soccer has been one of the best sport in the world ?
Here are 2 reasons .
First of all , soccer is more active than other sports .
Activation makes people exciting and remember their memory .
This activation make us also enjoy seeing and play the game .
For example , American football always has a moment to set the position .
To me , it is boring point when I see the American football .
I can give you another example .
Watching the baseball game also bores me .
Sometimes , game just finished with pitcher and catcher 's catch ball game .
Other athletes just stand there and watch the game just like us .
However , in soccer , every single player touch the ball , even the goalkeeper has a chance to get the ball .
On this point , there is second reason I can say .
Second reason is that soccer involved for all players to participate into the game .
For baseball , if hitter could n't hit the ball , other players would not need to move at all .
To me , that is weird .
Players are on the same ground and some of people are playing the game and some are not .
Playing almost 3 hours , some players could n't touch the ball .
Can we say these players participating in the game ?
I would not rather say yes .
If somebody wanted to play a soccer , I would recommend that he or she has to have a stretching because soccer is very active sport so always has a possibility to be injured .
Also , I will say you should wear the soccer shoes and socks .
Those items will help you not to be injured .
Drinking enough water would be good habit to enjoy not only soccer but also any other sport .
Nowadays , many people have their own favorite sports but people are starting to ignore other sports except their favorite sport .
We need to respect other sports and other people 's perspectives .
Soccer could be one of the boring sport to other people .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her , because it was her 18th birthday .
She knew that her parents were doing a surprise for her , but it was kept in a big secret until night party .
When she came back from school , her parents and all her classmates were hiding in a living room and waiting for her .
When she opened the door , the boys set off the fireworks .
Anna did n't understood what had just happened .
She looked around the living room , and surprised , how many was people there .
Then she thanked her parents , and started to enjoy the party .
Her parents had organised many contests , musical and karaoke .
There were many sweets , cocktails , fruits .
Anna was happy !
Then she and her friends went out , and walked through all the town until early morning .
Anna was very happy and excited and thanked her parents heartily for this birthday party .

Their girl has grown up !
Dear Jo ,
I 'm very pleased with your letter . I 'm going to try to give you some advice .
In the Czech republic there are many places you should visit .
The Czech republic is wealth for a history .
For example , ours capital city Prague there are many historical buildings like Carl 's bridge , Cathedral of St. Vit , big clock called Orloj and so many others .
In Prague is many good shops with clothes , souvenirs and many good things to buy .
If you prefer to go to nature I can recommend you ours mountains Krkonoše , Jeseníky or Šumava .
There is very beautiful nature , calm and fresh air .
You can go there only for a walk or for some sports like running or cycling .
If you go to south Morava , you should definitely try some vines or drink called Slivovice .
Here is also many nice castles .
For example , near Prague is castle called Karlštejn where lived Karel IV . or castle called Buchlovice which is on south - east of your country near the city Uherské Hradiště .
These are very nice castles .
Otherwise , the opportunities for a job here is quite a lot .
It depends what job you would like to do .
I do n't know what to write more .
If you would like to ask something or get to know more information about some place just let me know .
Best regards ,
Pavel
Dear Mr Smith .
I am Melina and I am interested in your job vacancy .
To begin , I would like to say that I love children .
In my opinion , we should build a perfect world for them to grow up in a safe and environmentally friendly place .
I have experience taking care of children .
I am the eldest of my family so I had to take care of my sisters and cousins .
I enrolled on different courses about children development and currently I am working as an au pair where I have to speak English .
I participated in sports clubs of my High School .
Although I am very keen on rugby and basketball , during the University I took part in the badminton club .
And I just learnt how to play ice hockey .
As I have said before , I have to watch out two kids , which includes cook .
Despite cook is my weakness , I always try my best .
I cook every day different and healthy dishes for the whole family and they love it .
Will I have to cook my own recipes ?
English will not be a problem because I know how to communicate with young people .
Awaiting your news .
Melina .
my favourite sports are gymnastics and martial arts .
i 've been practicing martial arts for eleven years but i havent lost the passion I feel about it .
the first martial art that I proved was tae kwon doo and I practice for 5 years , after that i started kung fu and i m still there .
i have been practicing gymnastics during 4 months and fascinated with it , i like to be tired for doing stunts , and I also feel very healthy because I exercise daily , if its not gymnastics it 's kung fu .
I like those sports because you need much strength and dedication to be getting better , I like kung fu weapons and handsfree forms , to do something spectacular in kung fu you have to do acrobatic gymnastics .
I invited my friends to try these sports and apparently they liked , many did not because they did not know well what it was but after living it for yourself you realize that are very beautiful sports .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I tried to renew my membership twice yesterday and there was a message of error both times .
So I gave up to try it again today .
I received a call from my credit card administration this morning to confirm and authorize that payment , telling me that there were two attempts of charging my credit card bill .
After authorizing my credit card administration , I tried to renew it , but again there was the same message of error .
So , I did n't try it again , because I think that there must have been a problem not related to my credit card account .
I am waiting for some instruction about what I have to do now to renew my membership .
Best regards ,
Amauri Tijerina Luna
Owing a pet is popular today even if their home is in a big city .
Many people oday have pets of all kinds .
Owing a pet would benefit all members of family .
First of all , a pet is a friend for the family and mush better is a memeber of the family .
One more advantage of qning a pet is that it helps children learn to be responsible and carring .
It is also good to adopt an animal which it do n't have a home and food and give in this love and affection .
On the other hand there are a lot of disadvantages of owing a pet in big citiew .
Pets and animals in general need fresh air and exercize outside and not being always in an apartment .
I have heard abou pets that they get sick by living in a small apartment in down town and that is terrible .
In my opinion it might seems good to have a pet if we are teke care of it .
All in all , qing a pet in a big city must be done carefully ensuring all that a pet needs .
Television can be able to both entertain and educate at the same time .
Good authors I think have to be able to find the way to keep together these to important aspects .
The first thing that I would suggest TV authors is focusing a set of strategic topics for an advanced society .
Environmental protection for instance , or more practically the correct use of the water in our houses .
Another example can be represented by the first aid activities and so on .
The topics can be easily focused if we have in mind a model of society where individuals have a central role .
Several contents could have an educative value , for example those concerning our relationships with others , or our relationship with nature and with different cultures and religions .
All these topics by using creativity and new technologies can be faced in a way to make them soft and adapt to entertain .
Today , I would like to tell you a shocking news .
It is called " 76 people are confirmed dead in Colombian plane crash " .
I think some of you have already known this news .
Here are some basic informations about the news .
A charter plane carrying 72 passengers , including players from Brazilian soccer team Chapecoense , crashed near Rionegro , Colombia , according to the country 's civil aviation department .
Nine crew members were also on board .
The civil aviation agency had initially announced that six passengers , three players , two crew members , and one journalist , survived the crash .
I think it is a catastrophe to victims and their families .
Recently , more and more airplane accidents occur .
Although I have never taking airplane , I would feel worry if I travel by plane .
To avoid accidents , government and airline companies have to do something to prevent tragedy .
For example , regularly examine the situation of airplanes is needed , at the same time , teaching people how to act when facing the emergency .
Thank you for your attention .
Grammar is the most difficult part in learning English .
There are few ways that help us master it .
First of all , you need to preview .If you do this and you 'll have a clear idea about what are you going to learn in class .
It'll make you learn faster .
Next , when you are in a class , focus on what the teacher says , she / he will teach you and give you a clearer understanding about grammar .
And they will also remind you some key points you do n't understand when you preview it .
In the class , you should take notes and write down what is Iimportant .If you have any question then you should ask teachers to help .
They'll be glad to help .
At last , when you learn some grammar concepts are new to you , you need to practice .It'll help you remember it and how to use it .
If you do all the things above , I promise your grammar will improve and you 'll master it eventually .
I visit Spaniards Arm quite often .
Usually I am there with my friends or colleagues for a dinner or a lunch .
Next to Hamstead Heath , this historic Inn is full of character .
The menu is more than one would expect from a pub or even a gastro - pub .
I like the variety of the main course selection and drinks .
I opted for a steak there once .
Surprisingly , they serve it with a half cut bone which is quite fun by itself , even before you taste the dish . Mashed potato is creamy and full of butter .
Meat is perfectly prepared , whether you ordered it bloody or well done .
Try one of the cloudy ciders on the tap and you will not be disappointed !
Taking care of our environment is considered for many of us one of the most important things in our lives .
Nowadays , in order to have the best for the actual and following generations , there are international common ways for individuals to contribute to solving environmental problems .
Recycling is both a popular and an undervalued method .
Everybody knows what separate rubbish into different bins means but , big part of the society believes that it is not worth doing it if there are people that does not recycle .
I would answer to them that , then , how do they explain all the sheets of paper , crystal and plastic items that have been made of recycled materials allowing us to save tons of primal resources ?
Saving energy is the other grand method available to everyone .
Using its respective light bulbs , household appliances and any other thing that saves energy is the only way that individuals can help but , it is not effective .
Although an entire town or city contributes to saving energy in their homes , it can not be compared with the waste of energy that industries make .
In this case , restrictions should be implemented by the government .
Taking everything into consideration , there is a good argument for supporting recycle , which is the following one : The biggest waste of energy take part in primal resources industries , if we reuse all the materials that had already been exploited , we would reduce at least half of its costs .
The chilis restaurant at 123 street , Toronto is really a great place to hang out .
The Scrumptious food served makes me go back there often . if you want to have a lip smacking dessert this is the ultimate place .
Everyone will love the appetizers and main courses served there .
The spice levels are suitable for everyone .
Moreover the ambience of the restaurant is marvelous .
If you want to have a quiet cozy dinner you can sit at the table in the corner .
Whereas if you are going in there to party with friends or watch a game you get a table at suitable place . I believe that if we all could go to this restaurant at the end of our course , we will surely have a great time .
Today , recycling used clothes are popular in Japan .
For several years , a secondhand clothing store increase and a lot of people use it .
Japanese people take interest in used clothes .
There is involved with a recycling spirits in Edo period .
In Edo period , there was the society that was called " super recycling - oriented society " .
Almost products and materials were recycled and changed new products .
People did this without special efforts .
It was done very natural in their lives .
There were many specialists to repair , recycle and collect products in Edo .
Used clothes were sold by " gyosyo " , that means peddler .
In 1723 , there are 1182 secondhand clothing stores .
It was just the number of union members so in fact , there more secondhand clothing stores in Edo .
The key point why expanded used clothes industry is " kimono " .
Kimono has very simple structure .
It can be made from used clothes to patch and darn .
Another point is that , the cloth was more valuable than now .
So people set a high value on the cloth .
According to these reasons , used clothes spirits took hold in japan .
After that , western clothes became popular in Japan , the recycling system was forgot for a long time .
However , secondhand clothing stores are increasing recent years .
There are many secondhand clothing stores now .
Japanese people have the spirits of recycling and loving old things still now .
Media or also known as mass media is one of the most powerful means of spreading information .
It gives people the opportunity to get to know what happens all around the world in each matter such as poverty , occupation , discrimination , suppression of human rights and so on .
Nowadays we can easily get information which we need through the Internet , in the newspapers , on the TV .
As European citizens we are bounded directly or indirectly with the loads of social problems and issues in Europe so we have to acquire our right of free access to information privately and randomly in order to stop corruption , to acquire knowledge about our rights .
So that we can be active citizens and help the EU continuing developing
Many years ago I used to go to the cinema every Sunday afternoon .
It was the best way to spend my free time with friends .
I never mind what kind of film I could see .
Only the place was important .
Nevertheless Today I usually go to the cinema when I really want to watch a particular film .
My likes about films have changed too .
When I was younger I would rather watch romantic films . I used to cry when the handsome boy kissed that pretty girl , or I was waiting for the special moment to say good bye to the bad ones .
Nowadays I try to choose films with good actors or actresses , special scrips and plots , documentary stories or special renowned Director 's films like Almodovar , Sanchez Arévalo o Alex de la Iglesia .
On the one hand Comedies are my favourites ones because I have to laugh when I have finished my work .
But on the other hand I have to get used to go to the cinema as often as I can , but I wish cinema will be cheap .
it 's a pity
I strongly agree with a statement that shopping is not always an enjoyable thing .
First , there are often a lot of people in bigger shops .
There comes no surprise that it is totally difficult to find a necessary thing with a good price in a defined time through a crowd .
Once I remember myself hanging around in the shopping mall Akropolis in order to buy shoes in two hours . I did not managed to get particular one , because of size , which some shops suddenly could not suggest as well as the quality of others did not seem to be valuable for fixed prices .
So , I did not buy new shoes that day , despite thatI was happy for getting rid of crowd and shops .
Second , shopping malls have full places of advertisements and loud songs playing .
There is no surprise that a person visits a big shopping mall after his long working day .
He is tired and because of winter he wears a warm coat .
What does it happen ?
He hears different kind of songs , advertisements for sales and this confused person starts buying things which are not useful to him in reality .
The problem goes after the problem and a person starts to feel sick .
Also , It is a well - known fact , that it is totally hot to be with coat in a shopping mall in winter season .
The problem is that a person has to carry his coat in a hand near his other purchases , what is not so easy .
Finally , not every assistant is able to advise you appropriate .
There are some assistants who if you ask or even do not ask , they start suggesting the best their products as well as the most expensive ones to you .
This can make your shopping really annoying , because some type of people need to check by themselves in order to evaluate the quality of product .
To sum up , shopping is not always an enjoyable thing , because it takes time , it is often full of people and a person can be annoyed quickly by incompetent assistants , who eager to help you by suggesting the most expensive products .
So , shopping does not always provide good feelings .
Hi jennie ,
I 'm glad you moved , I haven't got round to finding time to share with you .
I 'm afraid I ca n't go running in the mornings I 'm very busy at work .
There are plenty of clubs in the town .
If I were you I would pick up the one in the avenue , because of the facilities
it has , such as the swimming pool and the gym as well .
Working out in the gym twice a week is enough as long as you eat healthy and of course you should forget those delicious cakes you use to make !
I 'd love to teach you how to swim and the gym in the avenue is perfect for that .
What about the Saturday mornings ?
I 'm really looking forward to doing it !
I really do hope you get used to the neigborhood .
Talk to you soon ,
Sebastian
The football
The football is the most beautiful sport in the world , it 's the profession dream of almost all the boys when they are kids , when you play in your neighbourhood , you are playing that you 're Messi , or Cristiano Ronaldo or your favourite player of your team .
It 's the funniest sport in the world , kicking the ball , you are kicking the bad energies of your life , you will be infected of passion .
But the passion is not only when you are playing football , you can increment your passion supporting a team in the good times and the bad times , going to the stadium , and when your team reach the glory , you can also feel that , and in this moments you are the happiest person in the world .
So I invite you to join the love and passion when you feel when you are playing or watching a match of football , and if you share this love with another person the passion increases a lot , your feelings are in their higher level , in this sport you can feel the glory , and in the next second you can start to cry because you 're team ca n't finish the way to the championship .
There are lots of interesting sports but there is normally one that you like the most .
In my case is not really a sport in itself , it is a cultural activity which needs a big physical effort .
I am talking about dancing , specifically ballet .
I consider it one of the best sporty and cultural activities because you keep fit at the same time that you express yourself making an art stuff .
For dancing you need some mental and physical skills , but none of them are as hard as people think .
You have to be a disciplined and well - balanced person , that 's it .
Both characteristics will help you in other type of tasks and will improve your future development .
The start is the hardest part considering that your body is not used to do this kind of sport ; however , once you are in it everything becomes easier and you feel healthy and much more active .
So , if you are starting it , do n't give up because of difficulties are coming , just relax and be aware that you and your body require time to adapt to this new activity .
You will notice how the improvements come up without thinking too much .
One of the things that I enjoy the most is that you dance in a group therefore you meet people and you can make a friendship after a while .
You must not be in your own , otherwise you could not dance in a company , so that you share your passion with people that feel the same and that , make a strong relationship forever .
I encourage everyone to try it , I am sure you will become a better person .
I did not find it hard at all , as a matter of fact , it was easier than I thought .
1 . I guessed I had more fluency at writing , which suggests how well I 've improved .
2 . I did n't get stuck often at thinking in which word I should use , which gave me enough time to finish .
3 . I wrote the enough quantity of words required .
4 . Everything was kept neatly .
Anything was found difficult nor struggling .
I did my best and I succeed in getting a 5.0 .
Neverthless , I would like to improve some skills and although I did very well , I still got confused .
1 . I overthought every so often , because I was not sure if what I was doing was alright .
2 . I should stop thinking in Spanish and more in English since translating might be confusing .
MY FAVOURITE SPORT
Choosing a sport to practise is a complicated thing . You should choose something that you enjoy , but at the same time , something you can afford to pay for .
As a result of that , I have tried many sports in my life .
My favourite is diving .
Although you may think that is a dangerous sport , which can be , the adrenaline rush you feel when you are in the water makes it worth the danger .
If you are going to start practise it , I would recommend you to start taking lessons with an expert instructor .
It is very important to check the equipment first .
If are not used to do it you can make a mistake , and then it is when the sport became dangerous .
After a few lessons you will be able to go diving on yourself and enjoy the sensation of freedom that provides you this sport .
It is like you would be isolated from the world , just you and the ocean .
I have to say that it is one of the most amazing feeling that I have ever felt in my life .
I encourage you to try it .
Without any doubt our life is changed quickly and we do not realise about this .
How will be our life in the future ?
To begin with this , the main change will be the use of renewable resource instead of fossil fuels .
Nowadays , people is aware of environmetal problems and they will try to figure out .
For example , all future houses will use solar cells to produce electricity .
Moreover , there will be important thecnological advances in our life , like as intelligent mobile phones which could help us with day - to - day task .
Not only they will be used to telephone , but we could pay with them .
They will control our empty fridge and if you run out of any vegetables , your mobile phone would warn your supermarket and they would bring it .
However , Robots will not replace humans in the dairy tasks .
So that , we should carry on dust cleaning or washing .
Although , cars will be better than now , they will not fly yet .
The streets will be plenty of cars in the rush hours .
To conclude , it is impossible to argue against the fact that people 's live will change in the next years but , these changes will help to improve our environment and our dairy life .
It is often said , that shopping is a pleasant procedure but sometimes it becomes bothersome .
However , there are situations we do not find enjoyable at all .
I will mention some of the reasons why and when shopping can be unenjoyable .
Firstly , when we do not have enough time in the morning to go shopping , we have to do it in the evening when most people go and buy things they need .
Shopping may cause frustration mainly , when we have to squeeze through the crowd .
Secondly , shopping definitely become unenjoyable when we are not able to find products we want and desire .
On the one hand , overspending money .
Shops use a lot of tricky ways to encourage people to buy more than they need .
Nevertheless , poeople try to save money by every conceivable means .
To conclude , we have to know when and to which shop we should go to avoid stressful and not enjoyable situations .
Probably one of the most discussed topics - global warming , is also most serious issue ; world is facing today .
Researchers have proved that human activities such as industrialization , deforestation etc . can trigger global warming .
In this topic I would be highlighting some of the dangers of climate change and different ways through which government and individual may help to overcome this challenge .
One of the most evident effects of global warming is the depletion of the ice at North & South poles , in turn causing sea level rise and encroachment of land .
These phenomenon caused serious damages to ecosystem and sea life .
Further , continuous rising temperature is impacting weather patterns and leading to natural disasters .
There are scientific evidences , that calamities like Katrina , Hud - Hud can be linked to global warming .
As global warming can have such serious impacts on life on Earth .
It is high time to intervene and take action .
Government can dictate strict norms to control pollution and carbon footprints .
For example , governments can impose limits on emissions by manufacturing plants and force industries to help in forestation .
Individuals can also play their part in controlling global warming .
For example , individuals can reduce use of the plastic materials , use public transport to control emission , recycle waste material etc .
To conclude , global warming is serious concern which can not be ignored any longer .
Government & Individual both have role to play , in facing this biggest challenge of the Time , Earth is facing .

Michael is an editor in an international student magazine .
He holds a short story competition to improve students ' writing .
He hoped a lot of students could join this activity so he makes a rule which is if you take your friends ' writing you can get 1 dollar per writing .
The message was posted on the website .
While I watched that message , I was excited to find my friends to enter this competition .
I thought no matter who wins the competition , we all must get 1 dollar for prize .
But my friends were not interested in that competition , they thought writing is boring and got 1 dollar is small .
I told them , you can just write no matter what you write .
Finally , they copied my article in this competition .
They only want to get the free dollar , do n't spend time to focus on the writing .
One day Michael entered his company and his employee happily told him , we got many responses .
When he read the content of article , he discovered many of them are similar .
He was sad to go to his office .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had make a mistake .
Academic culture refers to the attitudes , values and that are shown by the people who work or study in universities .
After I joined ACU ( Australian Catholic University ) I have found vast differences in teaching method between Nepal and Australia .
In Nepal students study individually , do not ask questions with the tutor even if they are confused .
Meanwhile , Australian education is based on making students learn new skills .
Students need to have an active participation in discussion with their peers .
Besides , students are able to raise questions with the lecturer because they can express their opinion .
At first I felt difficult , stressed while studying in groups used to hesitate while sharing my ideas , opinion but now I am familiar with the academic culture .
Academic culture is challenge for many students for effective learning .
Peer learning is a small group of three to five students who are kept together to discuss the content and carry out educational activities in mutual engagement .
( Fisher , as cited in Strake , 2010 , p.2 ) , Peer learning is a two way learning process in which members of group feel easier to discuss the content .
It helps to know the importance of group work by giving and receiving feedback on particular tasks .
According to Hamp ( 2002 ) , the goal of EAP ( English For Academic Purpose ) course is to teach students relevant study skills they need throughout their degree .
It helps to share the ideas , knowledge , among the students and make them think critically , by using formal language while writing and so on .
In conclusion , the adoption of Australian academic culture has developed strategies for my learning .
I have become an independent learner and started to raise a question , share my opinion to the tutor .
In the future I will enhance learning strategies by working actively in group .
I want to talk about a restaurant called " Bierkeller "
It 's a restaurant located in Villa General Belgrano , Cordoba and the specialization of it is german food .
You have all the kind of german food you can imagine , from sausages with chucrut to Gullash with spatzle .
You have also common meat and basic food if you do n't want to try other types of food .
The restaurant is beautiful , it 's of a normal size , with many space and very well decorated , you have many photos and paints to see .
Most of the paints and photos are from Germany , because that town was occupated by German people many years ago .
It is also quiet , so it will suit perfectly for the class , we do n't talk that much neither make bothering noises .
People at the restaurant are very kind , the treat you in a very polite way and is worth going there
If we go to Bierkeller we wo n't regret and we will have a great time trying different types of food , learning maybe a little bit of the history of the town and be happy as a group
Almost everybody has ever thought of taking a gap year between leaving school and starting university , but we do really know all the advantages and disadvanatges that it entails ?
From one hand , a big part of global population consider this year off a way of learning and experience while you enjoy travelling all around the world and you get to know people from all the different cultures .
Nowadays , employers are looking for experienced people who knows how to adapt to all the different situations you can be involved in , such as an international lecture or a difficult plight .
It is also said that at the hour of heading to college , those people who have taken a year off are the ones who have less difficulties to learn and relacionate with other students because they have had used to it before .
It is a fact that those who spend a year abroad working on something , they can save money for university and they become more independent .
But taking a year off has its downsides as well , like the time people waste working on something they are not going to do in the future , because with any kind of extracurricular studies , people strangely find a good job .
That is why it is recommended to wait until you finish university to look for a job .
Another fact that should be highlighted is that while you are working for a year , people from your age are at university , and that means that they will probably finish their degree a year earlier than you , and this could be an inconvenience for you , because you will have to have a year younger classmates .
The important thing is that you are gaining skills that you can apply for your future career .
Many automobilindustries are working for a new future of automobils .
For many years Apple , Google and several traditional automakers have been running prototypes , which are driving from self and nobody can steer the car .
The question arises if driverless cars will be a boon or bane to us ?
Some people argue that this new idea of cars is a milestone for us and it will bring only positiv effects with it .
First of all self driving cars are good for people who have got a handicap .
At the moment people who has got a handicap can not drive a car on theirself .
This have got a devastating effect for her independence and freely living .
When this people can drive a self driving car the feel more comfortable and the can live more freely .
However , it is also important to remember that people with a handicap have got the same rights and chances as people without a handicap .
Similarly important is the fact that self driving cars are more saftier as no self driving cars .
The rising number in deadly car accidents raise an important question to all of us .
Is car driving really safe ?
Self driving cars are steered by a very modern software and this software is so exactly that the number of accidents will be decline .
In contrast self driving cars are very expensice and much people can not buy it .
Self driving cars are very modern and drive with a very highly technically software .
Rich people can buy it but people of the middle class not .
In the future this can make a highly gap between poor and rich people .
This is the reason why self driving cars can be in the near future only something for rich people .
The automobilindustries have to work on a plan that self driving can be bought by people oft he middle class too .
When this will be going on self driving cars can be an enrichment for our life .
The Reading museum in Berkshere has visitors from all age groups , but particularly suitable for young people who need help for school projects or want to take up creative things as a hobby .
They have a number of workshops for young people from beginner to semi - professional , and most of those are not so expensive .
You can learn various interesting art - works such as painting , photograph , ceramic , from the lifework professionals .
I 've taken ' ceramic course for beginners ' once .
Actually it was fun and I could make a lot of friends .
You ca n't miss the stylish cafe in the museum .
Their lunch menus are gorgeous and the price are reasonable .
You can also enjoy a quiet afternoon in the cafe if you go there around evening .
I really recommend every young people to visit there once when you have time although it might be better to avoid the weekends

subject : the transports of my local area
date : 24th june
introduction :
as requested , i have investigated the features of the main means of transports which are used in my local area .
my findings are presented below .
buses :
buses are the mai transport in my area .
these are very cheap and people who do not have a car use it to move everywhere . however , this transport isnot so comfortable because sometimes you must travel with lots of people .
cars :
people use their car for travel a long o short distance , this is really comfortable because you can manage the speed and where you will direct .
another option :
when you are not keen on travel by bs and you do not want get the car out the garage , the taxis may be the best option .
these are the combination between buses and your own car .
conclution
I believe that there should be more buses for the comfort of people .
there are several options to choose , but the choice depends on each .
My favorite sport is Football . I like it because it is a sport that does n't need a lot of means to be played .
In my country for instance , people starts playing football at the very early age .
The only thing they need is to have a ball and a piece of land .
Everybody can practise football .
The other reason why I like practising football is because it is a collective sport .
By playing football , you meet a lot of people of your age and make some friends .
Finally , football is like all sports very good for health .
Playing football at a regular basis helps to maintain a good health .
My advice to people who want to play football is to be passionate , to like and feel football .
As I said , it is not mandatory to have all the dedicated equipment but it could help .
They also have to remember that it is a game of contacts .
So , it might cause some injuries .
And for those who like football but are scary to get injured , they still have the opportunity to watch games on TV and play video game console .
It is common to see during summer many people in parks practising sports , like running , biking , or just doing every kind of physical activities .
Thanks god , I live right in the front of one big park .
So , when I wake up every morning , also pushed because I am a very active person , I get such a motivation to go out and do something .
I sometimes practise biking , running , or even dancing on sunday .
I practise also swimming in my apartment 's pool , and surfing when I manage to get to the beach .
But , not only in summer I practise sports , once in winter I practise also fun sports , like skiing , snowboarding , and Ice skating , among others .
So , when my friends ask me which is my favourite sport , a problematic decision comes to my mind , simply because I like them all .
But one of these sports comes to to the top of my thoughts more often : Running .
Why do I enjoy running ? .
I do not have a quick answer , but I can slide some ideas .
First , running is cheap .
If you want to practise this sport , you can simply take a couple of sneakers , and any light sportswear , and start to run anywhere .
There is no need of expensive technical clothes , or special fields , just you , and a place safe and with enough space .
Nonetheless , if you really want to get into this sport as a pro , you can get to invest a lot on clothing and gadgets .
Second , running is simple .
You do not need to get any special training when you start to run , you know it since you are a child .
That said , running is probably the easiest sport to practise .
Nevertheless , once you started to practise running , and want to really get into it , and improve , I do recommend you to take care of your health a to find professional assistance .
Injuries may happen for practicing it often if you do not know the way you step , or you do not take the necessary time to get the resistant that your body needs , for example .
Famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
The relationship between famous people and journalist is an attractive focus on our society .
In my opinion , it has two sides .
On the one hand , without their career effect , they would as normal as we are .
Famous people need a love , family , entertainment and support .
Sometimes , they are happy , sometimes they are sad
Like we all know technology is making the best of it .
Providing us needs that in the past were n't .
The society is growing and as it grows it gets more used to technology being everywhere .
Public transport is used every day by millions of people .
The mayority ; young or old age , since they are n't old enough or they are too old to drive .
Driving is the reason why adult people do n't tend to use as much public transport .
They just prefer to travel long or short distance in individual transport , known as car .
This is because technology has given us this opportunity , and as time goes by more and better modifications are made to car .
Which tends to catch our attention and waste our money in a way that can me saved up , in this casse using public transport .
This is happening now , and we are not even fully devoloped in technoloy .
Imagine the future , will public transport still be used ?
Will it modify our society ?
Will it be good , or not ?
That is something we have to work on .
IN helping our society grow , but not too much .
Just what we need .
Enough to live .
The purpose of this report is to assess the best and the worst aspects of Active Leisure Club .
Active Leisure Club 's gym is a modern built building .
The clients benefit of professional coaches , who train them in order to perform the exercises correctly .
There are appliances as treadmills , bikes , weightlifting and many others .
Although , there are not showers , and this really is a negative aspect .
You should build one to improve the popularity of your leisure club .
Those people who use the spa can benefit from treatments of the highest quality .
However , these services are very expensive , and not everybody can afford them .
You could low the prices a little bit .
That way , everybody could benefit of your spa .
In the club 's sports hall , people can play different sports and have fun with their friends .
Anyway , their children do not have a special place , so it would be recommended to arrange a safe place for them to play .
I hope that my report helped you , and Active Leisure Club will improve its facilities .
Nowadays everyone has read a book .
There are plenty of choice , novel , historic , drama or comedy .
Also , there are different form to read , I mean , you can read a book or an ebook .
Vanity fair is a good example for a book full of surprise .
You are reading and thinking what will happen .
But something happens unexpectedly and the new chapter is completely different what you had imagined .
Those things make me say that it is a good book .
The action involve you and you can stop reading .
The writer manage to catch all your attention .
That is a wonderful capacity of some good writers .
This book has a very fluent plot what makes that Vanity fair was one of the best novel .
In my opinion , a good book has to have surprise , has to have a good plot , a good variety of characters and , as I said , has to involve you .
When you read a book you ca n't stop to read it
The last CD I bought was Britney Jean by Britney Spears .
In this CD , the Singer expresses all her feelings and told us about her last experiences during recent years .
Firstly , you can find songs about her children , lack of affection , broken heart and some commercial songs which have an interesting lyrics .
People could think that if you buy this type of music , you will waste your money and it is just commercial music .
However , from my point of view , it 's not true .
When I listened this CD by the first time , I could sense how the singer break out in these songs and how many aspects of her life thought her to grow up a little bit more each day .
So , I would recommend this CD to other people because I think that they could meet the signer depply through the songs which compose this amazing CD .
Time passed and John had an unimaginable inspiration with his experiment .
He had to apply all his knowledge to make something concrete , with potential .
One night he went to a party with his colleagues .
He thought it will be good to distracted for a while .
It was already night when he was in Luck 's house ( Luck was an old friend ) and all of them were talking about life things , but then Luck remembered that John was working in an experiment that he did n't know what was it about , so he asked John in front of everyone :
-So , John ! How is it going ?
I heard that you were working in an experiment !
- Actually I am still working on it !
I worked on it very hard even though it was very complex , and my purpose was that it could get admitted by the inspector , and when I showed it to him he told me that it was good but I had to fix some details !
-He said .
-Oh ! Really ! I am glad that you 're doing well ! -Luck said .
When Peter listened that , he was interested in knowing about John 's experiment .
He had the insight that the experiment could be something vital to human life .
Peter 's career was similar to John 's .
He asked him if he could work with him and that he knew something that could help his devise to succeed .
John accepted his help ant told him to go to his laboratory .
As time passed Peter and John gradually became more close to each other .
After four months of hard work , they took the experiment with all the information to inspection .
The inspector finally accepted their work and told them that now they had to be patient because they will going to reproduce many of them .
They were very happy .
They decided to design a vertical field to expand the laboratory .
John draw a sketch to see how it was going to look .
Everything was going very good ; nonetheless Peter intentions changed and became riddle .
There was gap of ambition in him
My name is Daniel and my favourite sport is Padel .
Padel is a sport activity where you can enjoy with other three friends .
It is similar to tennis but the court is smaller than tennis court .
Furthermore , the court has walls and the ball can bounce off they .
Padel is my favourite sport because it is so easy to play for everyone and it is funny when you play with people who has the same level to you .
The most important thing that you have to think when you start to play this sport is that it is a game and you should improve your level fast because it is an easy sport .
I started when I was 18 years and I played 2 days per week .
Now , I play padel four days per week .

In my opinion , public transport has been improved during the last years , because cities has been doing a lot of investment for that .
At big cities , such New York , the main public transport is the underground , which is usually fast and not too expensive .
There are other types of public transport such bus , train or even planes for long trips .
I do not agreee with the idea which says that there is no future for public transport , because it is a perfect way of transport for commuters and nowadays , a lot of people is conscious with the global warmig and the envirnoment , and refuses to use the car every day .
In addition , the fuels price is increasing during the last years .
In summary , I think the public transport is a good way to move and the number of users is increasing every day .
Clare ,
Thank you for writing , I was worried about you .
Firstly , it is such a good news to know that you are getting used to your new life .
What have you doing since you moved from here ?
Secondly , I am so happy that you are glad with your new home and how is It ?
Is It look like your old house or it is bigger than this ?
In your letter you wrote that you are missing some people and things , what and who do you miss ?
I can imagine how difficult it can be , although calm down you will find out different things to do and make friends as soon as possible .
I really want to visit you .
If I am not travelling with my parents , I will go to your city .
I will look forward to hearing from you ,
Claudia
PUBLIC TRANSPORT .
Nowadays , travel in public transport has been an experience who none has failed .
However , exist now a discussion about what the people prefer , if the public transport or the vehicule of oneself .
Exist a lot of benefits of the public transport , at the start , you do nt have to drive yourself , you can listen to music , read a book o wathever you want without have to pay attention to the traffic , is true too that travel by this way of transport help the goverment because you have to pay it , and the majority of them are cheap enought to everyone .
However , so much people love have their own vehicule , a car , a bick , a moto , because this give you other kind of freedom , you chose the way , you chose the time , you chose the way in you drive it , the positive thing about this kind of vehicule is that you do nt have to take a bus , for example , crowded of people , you can go alone in your car , or whoever you want , but the important is that you chose .
In conclusion , we can say that every kind of transport has their own pros and cons but in my opinion the difference between both this is that in the secon you chose you own style .
Extremadura is a small place where you can not find many transport types .
First of all , the most of the people in Extremadura use the car for going to the job , to university or school .
The car is a quick , cheap and easy transport since you can use it when you want and you can park it where you want .
When you use the car , you do not have to think in timetables and you do n't have to pay expensive tickets for travelling .
However , I think that this transport has some disadvantages , for instance : if in a small city there are a lot of cars , the pollution will increase and the environment will be injured .
Also , when a city is small the people should walk to different places since everything is near to your houses .
Related to the use of the car , I would like to say that the Extremadura 's roads need a big reparation because , for example , the road between Cáceres and Badajoz is very damaged and it is difficult to drive for it .
In Extremadura , the second transport most used is the bus .
On the one hand , there are buses that connect the several neighbourhoods of the cities with the centre of them .
On the other hand , there are buses for travelling large distances .
I think that the urban buses have improved in Cáceres .
The last year , the mayor changed the old buses by new buses without increase the prices .
Now , it is securier to travel than last years .
Also , the seats of this transport are more clean and the bus driver go saying the name of each stop .
In the bus stop there are devices that advice to the people the minutes that they have to wait to the arrived of the bus .
Finally , in Extremadura the transport least used is the train .
The ticket is very expensive and the trains are very old .
Hello , dear guests ! We are glad to see you in our city . I want to tell you about interesting places in my city .
We are live in Moscow , it is a very big city , so there are many interesting places , where I used to do some activity .
That 's why I decide to tell you about some interesting place in our city .
I think , Gorky Park is a good place where we can spend our time .
In the summer it is a place where you can play Volleyball in the special ground with sand , play ping - pong or if you are tied you can sit in special hammock .
Many people come to the park for a picnic .
And in the evening you can go to the open - air cinema .
In the winter Gorky Park is very beautiful and there are ice skating park .
Everybody goes to it because it is the best ice skating park in Europe .
There are dancing square and many romantic alleys , also there are toboggan slide .
Guys should not go to snowbording .
I think it is good plays to other activities .
I like this park , so to my mind it is the best park in Moscow . You should go to the Gorky Park .
Hi Alison !
Nice to hearing from you .
I 'll try to describe for you an ordinary daily menu in my country .
Breakfast should be a shot of energy in my opinion .
Most people eat scrammbled eggs and drink a cup of tea .
But I prefer a strong coffee instead of tea .
It 's a good way to wake up !
Dinner contains two meals .
First is a soup , the most popular is chicken soup .
Main course is very heavy - lot of potatoes with meat .
I would prefer to eat more light dishes like vegetables with rise .
Supper always contains sandwiches .
As usual I 'm on a diet , so I prefer only yogurth .
Being fit it 's nice ! :)
I hope it would help you .
Kisses ,
Monika
I introduce myself : I 'm Italian with an obsession for the English language
I ca n't stop studying English language , I'm a sort of ' englishaddicted , but I wish I were an English native speaker , I do n't know why .
I 've been studying English at school
, later I took my degree in Modern Foreign Languages and Literatures , starting my to and from England to improve my skills .
While studying at the University my idea was to move to the UK to work there , but I got married so I could n't realize my dream . !
I found myself teaching English in my Country , far from the language competence I was longing for .
I will never stop visiting the UK and trying to improve my speaking and writing skills , thanks too to your help .
4 . Do you learn more at school or on placement ?
Nearly every education will apply a placement in their education program , to get the skills and experience of their pupils to a higher level .
But , is it also that necessary ?
Where do you actually learn more , at school or on placement ?
First of all before arguing this question , it is important to compare the answers with people who are on the same education and school .
Because there can be a lot of differences in the characteristics of those two subjects .
After that , having said I can clearly write down my opinion about this question .
I think that at my school the balance of this civil education is n't right and fair at all .
Because the numbers of theory lessons about our discipline are by far many hours less than I expected to get .
This makes it nearly a complete self study education , which should n't be that way at this level of schooling .
So because of this , the placement is always a step ahead to choose for at this question because they will teach you directly more .
In addition , on placement the things you learn are always focused on that particular job and company .
So the details and information they teach you will be more useful in your future career than the random information about the subjects at school .
So this makes it already two against zero for the placement .
And finally the third and last reasons why I think you learn more on placement than at school .
When you go to school you have to follow lessons which are off course useful for your knowledge but , the way of following this lessons are not a natural work pattern .
In a natural work pattern you have to do , also like school , your tasks but the communication is also an important part of it .
This important way communication lacks at school , because it 's a nearly a one direction way of communicating from the teachers .
You have to make a test and they will give you a rating for it .
While on placement they work more in an evaluating way to improve skills .
So with the these three arguments all going in the same direction to explain my opinion at this question , I think it has not to be explained any further now .
Over the last years , people 's attidute has been changing .
The necessity declined that working and living needs to be fairly close to each other .
Managing long distances seems to be normal nowadays .
Moreover , people enjoy being unbound and therefore , they are willing to travel long distances .
However , public transport has been critised more and more over the last years because of its inconenvience .
Some people go even so far and do n't assume that public transport will have a future at all .
A lot of public services were cut down in order to save money .
Therefore , busses are not running as often or reglulary as they used to .
Especially in the countryside , public transport is no alternative to cars due to the lack of frequency .
Consequently , people prefer taking the car .
Firstly , because they gain independence therewith .
Secondly , they can visit each place without any circumstances .
For instance , there is no need to change the bus .
It is also more convenient to go to work by car as you can leave when it suits you and not because the last bus is running .
In addition , the car is also more convenient in respect of the timing .
After having had a long day at work , people long to get home as quick as possible .
Furthermore , ticket prices have been increased rapidly in the last years .
Travelling by train as a family or group is often far more expensive than taking the car .
Nevertheless , public transport still provides several advantages in comparison to taking the car .
For example , it is no parking space required .
Sitting in the bus can also be quite relaxing , especially considering the heavy traffic during rush hours .
Finally , it still provides a useful way of travel for all who do n't have a driving licence .
In the end , the service of public transport needs to change to attract more people and to have a rosieer future .
However , it will remain in the future as still many people use it or even depend on it .
The purpose of this report is to inform about how the city of Granada take care of envirnoment .
Rubbish and pollution
Granada can be consider a clean city as regard of rubbish treatment .
There are lot of recycling points of plastic , paper , used oil , glass and batteries .
And there is a big universitary commnunity involved in recycling .
As for pollution it refers , in spite of to have a decent public transport , Granada is one of the worst cities of Spain .
Clean Infrastructures
How was said , Granada have a decent public transport and now it is being improved by adding a metropolitan train .
However , Granada can not be considerer as Ciclyng Friendly , there is less ciclyng roads than in other cities of similar size .
In addition , the oldtown is not as involved as it should be in clean behaviour , being the University who make the biggest effort .
Summing Up
I considerer that Granada score 6.5 of 10 about taking care of envirnoment .
There is good points but a lot of work must be done to achieve the eco - friendly title .
The most absorbing place in my town is obviously the Big Castle .
It was built in 1754 and renovated in 2007 and nowadays you can see the new face of this amazing place .
When you will get to the highest tower , you will watch the most breathtaking view .
It is a place where you can always find loads of tourists and foreigners .
When the weather is good enough close to the castle take place many kinds of parties and enterinments .
Like folk dances or shooting with a bow .
Unfortunately , tickets are expensive but worth buying . I also honestly recommend you to see all the places around the Big Castle such as Town Museum or Folk village .
And what 's more , castle is situated in the centre of the town with an easy walking distance to shops and park .
I can assure you will never get bored with this place and all things things connected with Big Castle will make it memorable for you .
Hope you will enjoy your stay .

Nowadays almost every person in the world watches movies temporarily or permanently .
It can be done by going to a cinema or watching movies at home .
I like both ways .
Regarding my preferences , I would like to admit that silent genre conquered me .
Of course , unprepared viewer ca n't understand inner beauty of this genre and will choose something mediocre .
However , simplicity in some cases can be very good and smart .
When I want to watch something easy , comedy or horror comes to my mind .
I do n't appreciate melodramas or love stories much , but they should be paid attention to .
In my opinion , very few people use movies for broadening the mind .
They are simply relaxing by such a way .
That day was a terrible day with Michael , he woke up and felt totally exhauted after an overwhelming birthday party .
He even did not remember what has happened and a serious headache made him did not want to get out of the bed .
His mom was disappointed about that , too .
She even did not want to talk to him after that situation happened .
Anyway , he is her son , and she had no choice but to take care of him in spite of any situation .
She talked to him:"How about you today ? " .
He did not answer at all , besides , he hit the chair near her , and unfortuantely , that chair hit her in a serious manner .
She even could not yell a word , just looked at him disappointedly .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
My favourite website is Drive2.ru .
It 's a kind of a social network , but it differs a bit from ordinary networks .
The aim of the site is to get together people interested in cars .
In this network you create a profile of your car , write a list of improvements you have done in it , upload photos and movies about you car and of course you meet a lot of people with the same interests .
Drive2 users often have a lot of technical questions about their cars .
So they often need help of professionals .
I think that it is necessary to involve some professional mechanics to give advice to users .
The other website I often use is Google.com because it is the greatest searching service ever created by human beings .
I think it is the best among other searching systems because of it is very fast and you get only the information you asked for and nothing excess .
I think that many google users will be happy if the developpers bring more useful information to the main page , for example weather information , carrency rates or hot news .
Moreover google map service needs some improvements such as street names , map accuracy and more city panorams .

This topic leads me to think of my brother 's child .
This result in different views of whether people accept it is easier to raise children now a day .
I hold the belief that the children are really easy to raise than before .
First , the parents only want fewer kids , so the children 's resource must plentiful than 50 years ago .
I hold the example .
My brother only has one child , but my grandfather has four children .
My brother 's child can very easy to get the toy which he required directly .
However , my father never got the toy when he was a child , because too many kids need to be fed .
My grandfather must work hard to support his children by additional job .
They had no money could use on entertainment .
That is why I mention that my father never got the toy when he was a child .
Now a day , every child can get more and more resource from their parents because of less competing by other child .
That is what I say that the fewer children can get more resource and easier to be raise .
Second , more and more infrastructures appear in our city .
Of course , that must include the health care system .
For instance , in the big city we can very easy to find the specific space to serve our children , such as special toilet and Breast - Feeding Room in every subways .
These kinds of space can make parents comfortable and concentrate on their care .
My brother told me when his baby should be feed when they walked on the street .
They can quickly to feed his baby .
That is friendly for children and parents .
On the other hand , the software infrastructures are important as well as hardware system .
Health care system also helps the parents to care of their children , because of people can spend less money to recover their disease by insurance .
This is a good example to show that the infrastructure can help parents to care of their children .
Of course , some people may be moved to disagree with my position on this issue .
That being said , I still feel that the reasons I have presented was strong ones , such as more resources and infrastructure .
Having a healthy lifestyle is one of the most important things for our health , because it reduces the chances of getting sick and it gives you the energy and concentration you need .
But what should you do in order to live a healthy life ?
Eating on a schedule is a very important tip you should take in consideration and also trying to avoid fried meals or fast food .
Unhealthy food and neglecting physical exercises increases the chances of getting fat and having problems with your heart , liver and other organs .
Fruits , vegetables and water
Your body requires many types of vitamins in order to function properly , which are found in fresh or boiled vegetables and fruits .
They would help you immune system , your skin and will also give you the amount of energy you need the whole day .
However , drinking 2 litters of water everyday is essential to your health and has a lot of benefits such as helping energising muscles or keeping your skin look good .
Sports and sleep
Another think you should take in consideration if you want to live a happy long life is doing physical exercises , such as walking in the park , going to the gym or playing team sports .
It will give you a lot of energy to study and do the things you love , while feeling and living healthy .
Besides that , you should also sleep between 8 - 10 hours per night , so that your body can function effectively .
Do 's
-eat fruits and vegetables
-drink water
-sleep 8 - 10 hours / night
-do sports
Do n't 's
-eat a lot of Fast Food
-drink excessively alcohol
-be lazy
In conclusion , you do n't have to do a lot of effort to have a healthy lifestyle and there are plenty of benefits from it .
You will feel great , would concentrate better , have more energy and have less health problems .

No future for public transport is one of the worst things in our life .
Thus , our state spears no effect on fight it , transportation now is very over crowdedness and difficult , especially in the rush hour which people leave their jobs and go to their houses at 2 o'clock , the main reason for that is the increasing the number of people in our country ( housing problem ) and the result of that a lot of accidents has been done and a lot of people were died .
Recent U.S. study revealed that the bus ride and trains regularly maintains the agility of the body and helps in reducing weight .
According to a study published by the journal « American Journal of Medicine Brevintev » in August / August next that the more public transport in the city , where population has become leaner and healthier .
The U.S. researchers from two universities in the state of Pennsylvania and the Foundation « Rand » American research and development staff to monitor regularly attend public transportation or go to work by car within a year .
The study results showed that people who ride transportation .
Public decreased their weight by three kilograms on average , compared to people who use the car to move and the study attributed this result to walk to the bus stop and running to catch the bus in the expected position requires goer public transport more traffic , while this does not happen with motorists .
The study pointed out that the public transport network in the United States has not been expanded since a long time compared to the situation in Germany , for example .
He appealed to the experts in political circles in the United States to invest more money in public transportation and improving security in the ways of the infantry in cities and make them more attractive to encourage people to use public transport .
The supervisor of the study , John M ..
MacDonald of the University of Pennsylvania : « investment in public transport will allow the possibility of reducing obesity people » .
Suffered the transport sector in the Arab countries of the many shortcomings and poor performance and is a form of environmental pollution and this is due primarily to a lack of the capacity of public institutions to develop strategies necessary to intervene appropriately and allocate investments effectively and improve the organizational capacity and result
So it did not materialize for the transport sector often necessary capacity to provide reliable and safe transportation and moderate cost and in spite of the high demand for transportation services in the Arab countries are still public transport systems are undeveloped and drive people to rely on private cars .
It has been observed , for example , that increasing the number of cars varied between 7 and 10 percent per year in Jordan and this situation is similar to what happens in other Arab countries , and despite the investments in roads and infrastructure in the last few decades , the performance of this sector remains weak as a result of congestion severe urban centers and poor air quality in many cities , land degradation and high rates of emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming .
The optimistic opinion , some people object that " no future for public transport " saying that the future of public transport is clear and the prof of that in ancient there was n't any transport and by the time people starting to invent new means of transportation ranging from cattle , cart , carriage , boat , ship , lorry , private cars until the plane , so they hope that the transportation be best by the creative people .
In the other opinion , the pessimistic opinion , in developed countries like Japanese and Kuwait we do n't find like these problems because they have a good planning , they make ways underground and overground , then they have ways only for people and ways only for cars , finally , we should have a good plan and the government should care with that and plan for traffic regulation to solve this problem .
Hi Max ,
How are you ? I 'm fin .
This day are a sunny and fantastic days and I will start school in a week .
I recommend you to visit the beach because it is fantastic in hot days .
And there are a lot of beach bars for snack between meals .
I recommend you , too , to visit the castle because it is very interesting .
I offer you to go for a walk to Anec Blau because there is a cinema with some new funny movies and there are a lot of clothes shops too .
I 'm not sure what is the most expensive restaurant in my town , maybe there are some near the beach because the tourist normally go there .
My typical evening out is going to Anec Blau and after that I go to the cinema to watch a comedy film or go for a walk with friends .
Silvana .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am very glad of the fact that you visited our country and the area of Silesia .
According that , I recommend you to visit Tyskie Brewery in Tychy .
It is worth seeing because there is the most famous brand which brews one of the most popular beer in Poland .
In my opinion , a trip will be fascinating because of the fact that the building of the Brewery is orginally German - owned brewery which has been brewering been for almost 400 years .
It contains a liitle museum which is open for tours .
I strongly advice to see that , there is an English - speaking guide who will show you the way of brewing process .
Tickets must be booked in advance and there is a tasting session at the end .
There you could buy some souvenirs - glsses , bottles , T- shirts , cups and , of course , beer !
It is a good purpose , to see and get to know the place , where in Poland produced traditional and well known beer .
I hope you will take it into consideration and go to sightseeing our local but famous Brewery .
Yours faithfully ,

The Asian restaurant Tian review
For our end of the course 's dinner , I 'd recommend the Asian restaurant Tian .
Firstly it 's a really exquisite place , and it is decorated with objects from the South Asia .
The atmosphere seems exotic and calming .
The place is small but it 's very cozy .
They serve all meals in small portions ; and they suggest that the servings can be shared ; so everybody can try more itens from the menu .
The food is really tasteful , each bite it 's an invite to travel by the senses to far away places in Asia .
Finally , to add one more touch to the experience you can take a ride in their tuk - tuk .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
He got that mysterious look in his eyes .
He just realized how to solve one of the biggest physical challenges mankind has been interested in for ages .
Time travelling !
We had been looking at this problem from wrong angle all the time .
The periodic move of minute hand compared to smooth path of seconds hand .
We were trying to reverse the flow of time , but that is not possible at all .
We have to focus on the breaks .
Time is running , seemingly continuously , same as seconds hand on his clock .
But we got this perception just because our eye can see only limited number of images in a time period .
If time period is long enough , like minute , we can see strict distinction between one and two .
That is the key !
We need to slow down the time !
In other words , we have to be fast enough to see that breaks in time .
Then we can just jump inside it and move either direction , as we wish .
Peter grabbed his notebook and immediately wrote all this down .
He ca n't forget any word of it !
Nowadays we live in society that we is totally dependent on transport .
This happens because , not only we live in a big cities but also we have no time to waste .
Due to this we have witnessed to an increase of traffic .
Public transport are for some people one good solution for many reasons , such as , they can save money and travel quickly .
However , some people say that public transport have no future , they might be right.ple do n't agree with it , they prefer travelling by car .
Some people say that public transport have no future , they might be right .
Considering that the companies now are moving to the surrundings of the cities and the lack of more and flexible timetables some people exclude the public transport option .
As a result of this many people are trying new opitions like car sharing .
It is believed that travelling by car is more comfortable and convenient for everyone , consequently car brand 's look at is as a new opportunity creating new hybrid cars in order not to damage the environment .
I personally believe that because of all this the public transport will have no future in our society .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .
It was the day of her birth .
She woke up in the morning full of enthusiasm and zest for life .
She was sure that everyone remembers about the celebration and have a gift for her .
But it turned out that everyone had left the house for work and no one was waiting for her with the wishes .
She went to school very disappointed .
Day of school very stretched because Anna always thought about the sad morning .
However , the surprise was still to come .
Anna did n't expect that after returning from school she finds his family and friends .
All of them were waiting for her with lots of gifts in a beautifully decorated room .
Anne was very surprised and happy .
I 'm a teeneger and now a days I recognize there are a lot of ways to get to know something .
In the past technology was poor and only a few guys had a smarphone or a computer .
In contrast , today everyone has the latest model of telephone or computeror whatever .
In the last ten years technology have made a big jump and thanks to the Internet we can search everything whenever we want .
In the past was better than now because grandparents or older people could tell you how to do something for the first time , they could give you some useful advice and you could establish a relation with them .
Today everyone knows how everything is easier with technological machine but it 's more sad because you ca n't compare your thoughts with nobody .
For that reason , I think that for me , young people in the past learned a lot from their grandparents and it should be the same today too .
I 'm going to talk about the famine and thirst in Africa .
There is a large number of African children , who suffers with the lack of food and clean water .
Children are supposed to be the future of their countries , but in Africa , especially in the countries in sub - Sahara Africa , there are many cases of famine - extreme cases , so children spend very difficulties .
Their education is affected , for example .
They have to walk away long distances to have clean water and to work too to survive .
Children who have to work and can not go to school , wo n't get a better life and their dreams never will come true .
Unfortunately this is the sad reality .
Besides that , the lake of food and clean water are responsible for many diseases , which are responsible for a large number of deaths , because there are n't enough sources to cure the populations .
Ear we have some of them : anemia/ anemia ; rickets and malnutrion …
The principals cause for famine in Africa are the ethnic conflicts , which causes warms ; the decrease of fertile grounds and the use of ground only to produce monocultures to export .
Every day , Tom walks next to the river to see the landscape and to feed lots of squirrels which live in the trees .
Sunday morning , Tom was walking as usually when he saw a big poster with a picture of a big motorway .
In that moment he understood that the mayor will build a big motorway there , next to the river .
Suddenly , he thought that the workers will cut all the trees , and the squirrels will lose their refuges , so he thought that he had to do something immediately .
He wrote a letter to the town hall explaining the situation and asking to stop the construction .
He suggested to build the motorway in another place to save the squirrels and to protect that beautiful landscape .
The mayor accepted Tom 's proposal , and he ordered to build the motorway in another different place .
Tom arrived home very late .
It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
firstly , the primary cause of bushfire is human activities .
lacck sense of civic responsibility is lead to bushfire easily .
For instance , some people discarded cigarette or match which is unattended like barbeque or campfires .
In addition , in many developing country , unemployment they also migrate to forest and set fire to enhance cultivated surface .
Moreover , a small piece broken of bottle or glass can also lead to bushfire .
it will attract sun 's ray and set alight .
Bushfire caused by numerous human activities but almost started from carelessness of people ( Roland as cited in Schauble , 2009 )
My subject will talk about my autumn holidays .
I went a week at Center Parcs in French with my family , my godfather , and my best friend .
The Center Parc is in the region of Lorraine .
We left Monday morning at ten 0'clock , we should have put three hours away but we put double because the plugs .
Once arrived , we unloaded the car and we went to the store .
Tuesday we went to visit the Sainte- Croix Animal Park .
They are more than 1,500 animals from 100 different species .
I saw deer , bear , lynx , bison , wolves , lemurs , vultures , red pandas and other animals .
Wednesday I went to try for horses with my godfather to possibly buy one .
We went in two riding stable but I have not found the horse that I liked ..
Thursday I went with my family to the Strasbourg Cathedral .
It 's huge and beautiful . I will show you a picture later .
And in the afternoon we went to the Center Parc of the pool .
It 's big with many activities .
Friday morning we did canoeing and paddle boating on the small river that ran along the center and in the evening we went to the restaurant .
The next day , me and my best friend went to play bowling and billiards . while my parents took my sisters ride a pony .
And the afternoon , the centre organizes a lesson for agility dogs .
I did with my dog .
It is called Canelle , it 's a Jack Russell Terrier .
It 's very small !
It measures about 30 centimetres .
The lesson is not very well , she was interested in other dogs and she was not listening .
At the end , the teacher asked me the exercise again .
It was perfect , she jumped sixty centimeters .
And Sunday morning we returned because the weather was bad .

The graphic information presented in the flow chart illustrates the procedure regarding to the form of bank notes , which can be sorted into 6 main phases .
Initially , the format of the notes should first be designed considering the background color and security issues .
At the same time , skilled machinists are prepared with the use of metal plates in order to set up a fixed mould .
After that , the pringting process comes into play .
50 pieces per sheet are set with special ink prepared , producing images that colors on both sides with a slow speed .
The most significant procedure is called inspection , which means mannual check by particular machines and staffs , and then they are classified into 3 different columns , including good quality sheets , partially damaged sheets , and bad sheets .
In the final stage , the well - performed sheets are packed and distributed to each branches , while the broken ones are safety disposed .
This is the whole process how a bank note is made .
The flew chart shows six main steps in terms of making bank notes .
As following desriptions , namely , Design , Preparation of matal plates , Printing , Inspection , Packaging and Distribution and Disposal .
When you need a bank notes , the first thing you should do is to design what aspects of information you want .
Next , make sure the metal plates worked well .
Afterwards , you are able to print the sheets of the bank notes(50 bank notes per sheet ) .
The most significant part of the
step is inspectation , where the printed sheets should be
manually inspectors by the officers .
It depends on whether the sheets are in good or bad qualities .
If it is not very well , we can destroyed them securly , however , a few sheets may partially damaged , it does n't matter due to the fact that further seperation will assiste you to get the wrong sheets .
At last , all of
the sheets have been dealt with correctly .
Overview , it is clear that the process of making bank notes begins with Design and ends with Disposal or Distribution .
Travelling by public transport is expensive and uncomfortable .
The trains and buses are not big enough .
There is not enough space for your legs and you often do not get a seat .
This will not be a problem if you travel only short distances , but on long journeys that will be very uncomfortable .
Travelling with your personal car is much more comfortable .
There is the possibility to set up your seat .
It is your own decision when you get up , because there are no time boundaries .
There are no times when you have to be at the bus stop .
If you use public transport for long distances in a city , you will often change the bus .
There is the risk that you would not get the connecting bus and so you are stressed .
In conclusion travelling by car is the easiest and best way . I think that it is not possible to use public transport because there are no buses or trains .
Maybe car sharing is an innovative alternative to public transport .
Many people use their car alone .
The most of the time they have free seats in their cars .
So they could spare their cars with other people
here are many fields of study that have not been discovered or researched by humans .
Many reasons cause the research hardly going on .
As a result , there is the debate whether educational institutes have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing field of study in which they are unlikely to succeed .
In my opinion , I agree with the statement with qualifications by following reasons .
Admittedly , some of the research need to invest many resources that educational institutes can not afford .
Such research indeed will fail .
Educational institutes should dissuade students .
However , if there is not lack of the resource for the field of study , Educational institutes should support students for their study area .
Education 's greatest purpose is to encourage student to attempt and learn from the fail .
Take Thomas Alva Edison , the inventor of the light bulb , for example .
He tried a lot of different materials to make filament of the light bulb .
Once , people think he would succeed .
Even though the research really can not succeed .
Students can learn some things from the course of the research .
In the course of the research , students will think how to develop process of the research and know which segment will cause the problem making the research fail .
In addition , students in the course of research maybe create serendipity .
Like Alexander Flrming Alexander , the inventor of the antibiotic , discovered the Penicillin accidentally from the research of the germ .
" You must do the thing you think you can not do . "
said by Eleanor Roosevelt .
The invaluable thing is to turn the impossibility to possibility .
Therefore , Educational institutes should encourage the student attempting the field which unlikely to succeed .
Remember when in school you learned the three esential things for living ; reproducction , nutrition and interaction .
Well , humans become more and more sedimentary whith the pass of the time and forget about interaction and mevement .
Doing sport is not only for getting fitter is also something you need to do as a habit .
Nowadays going to the gym is the new trend , but you do n't only have to do sport because it 's trendy .
I might not have the tipical sports women body type , but I really enjoy doing sport and feeling the glory of movement .
My fabourite sport is tennis , although is not the only one I practice is the one I most like to play .
I must admit , I 'll never be the best tennis player you 'll ever meet .
But that 's not my goal of practicing a sport .
Apart of ovbiouslly having fun and socialice , the way you feel after running and burning feels really good .
Hi Anne ,
Thanks for your e - mail .
It is very exciting to hear you are coming to Latvia .
Personally , I think the best time to come is in the summer .
Because at this time we have a lot of interesting activities like concerts , festivals and so on .
If you want to meet young people I suggest you stay in a youth hostel .
The first good thing is they have low cost and here you can meet students from all around the world .
In spite of that the weather has to be warm in summer , you should bring with you not only light clothes but also jacket for rainy day .
Thanks also for your invitation to join the group .
I would love to do if I am free .
I will be able to show you and your friends the most interesting places in my area .
Let me know when you are coming .
Warm regards
When I was in high school , I loved to go to different kinds of activities .
Quite often , I felt difficult to balance both my study and hobby at the same time .
So , having a good time - management have become important in my study .
I remember that I had a drama play which was held just couple weeks before final exams .
However , instead of focusing on my study , I paid more attention on rehearsals .
As a result , one of my subjects failed because I did not have enough time to catch on the lessons .
At that moment I felt regretful and frustrated .
From that experience , I have realized that I need to change my learning strategies for a successful study .
Firstly , to know what is priority is essential for achieving success .
Therefore , I avoided social activities during the period of exam .
In the same way , Rowh ( 2006 ) points out that it is important to get controlled our self .
In addition , not only putting things in order but also well - organized planning are helpful to manage times .
As Academic skill Unit ( 2012 ) states that daily , weekly and semester planner can benefit for arranging our times ( P.22 ) .
In my case , I planned the activities into a proper time because the planners clearly show me the outline in the near future .
Without a doubt , this valuable experience let me know the importance of taking responsibility to my own learning .
More significantly , I understand that time - management and planning are crucial in academic life .
Therefore , in the future , I will keep improving those abilities and become a more oragniezed person .
Football : The most incredible sport in the world
As we know football or soccer is the sport king of the present .
It 's a great party and we can have real fun watching a football game even if it 's by television .
Do you want to know why is the most enjoyable ?
When we watch a football game everybody is expecting that at any time someone will score a goal or do some jink that gets us excited and that 's the magic of the football .
If you want to start practicising this sport you have to get fit and run a lot because you got to have a good physical condition to play because it is a very demanding sport .
And I recommend you to start looking for a football club to start playing with another players .
The best thing about football is that you can practise a sport and you can socialise with other people that love that sport as much as you .
SHOPPING GUIDE FOR TOURIST
The aim of this report is to describe the shopping facilities in my town and make recommendations to try encourage the tourists visit the shops .
Some of the information was collected on the shops , and on the web .
According to the investigation , the majority of the shops are in two areas ; Firstly the puerto shopping center , it is allocated in Puerto Marina , and the offers of the shops is majority fashion , coffee shops and pubs .
The other big commercial area is in the city center , with a more variety offer , fashion , bars , supermarkets , local food shops , wine shops etc ....
Alternatively every Friday in the parking next to Tivoli World , there is a street market where you can find every kind of products , local products , food , CDs , DVDs , etc ....
Puerto Marina is more visited than the city center , even when in the city center there is more diversity than in Puerto Marina .
In the light of the results , I feel it would be to our advantage if we make promotions of the city center as a good destiny .
I would recommend the tourist office to encouraged the variety of shops In Puerto Marina
In conclusion , the tourist office should have more adverts of the city center .
Dream walked towards me and said do you know how to satisfy a lady .
I will teach you how to satisfy a lady tonight .
I was stunned by her words and become speechless for a moment .
Once again dream said to get ready , I did n't utter a word , without wasting any movement .
I grabbed her hips and dragged her towards me with a force .
She smiled and said not so soon Dreamer , I will take a bath and freshen up first and then we start .
I said that I would accompany you .
She smiled and said wait for some time I will finish my body massage and then you can join .
I said that I will help you in applying oil she said do you know how to apply .
Dear James
Let me introduce myself , I am Luis from Spain and I work as a civil engineer in a Spanish infraestructure company called Acciona .
I 'm 35 year old and lately I have been reading carefully all your letters .
I am so impressed with your post so I have just decided to get your last book ( and all the gifts , of course ... ) .
In fact , I know your book is going to help me to improve myself in lots of fields .
I completely agree with you , maybe each word you say .
I have a mortgage , a car , a degree , two children , a wife and lately I realized how I strive to make ends meet .
I usually earn between 50.000 € and 60.000 € each year and it is never enough , I do n't have a financial security .
My company is making redundancies and I am always worried about that .
The point is that I completely focus on my projects soI spend ten hours every day making a tremendous effort with my budgets , trying to increase benefits and I am doing well .
I manage risky projects and eventually I get high revenues .
I often think what happened if I would make all these effort on my own business ?
For this reason I am reading your book and listening to your podcast .
I will keep reading and listening to you .
Best
Luis

My favourite film
Films do not occupy a great time of my spare time .
When I am not doing my homework and am not learning English , I like watching a film .
Sincerely , I found it very difficult to choose the best film .
There are many interesting films with valuable plots and famous actors .
Most of them are extremely interesting and worth seeing it .
They deserve to be in the top one hundred .
But finally I have decided to vote for one of them .
My favourite actor is Tom Cruise and consequently the best film I have ever seen was " Far away , far away " , where he plays starring role with his ex - wife Nicole Kidman .
I was impressed by the production because of the its valuable plot .
The story is about the love between two young people , poor man and rich and beautiful lady , who leaves her family .
She wants to try different way of life like the common girls .
Both , they pass through a lot of difficulties and lived poor life .
The aim of the two personages was to gain a piece of land in America .
They have taken part in a competition with riding horses .
Only faster competitors was given the land .
Of course , our tandem gain a piece of land .
The historic context is recreated in the film .
I recommend you to watch this film and I think you will no regret .
Most people in Bali rely too much toward their private vehicles hence they totally abandoned public transportation .
We can consider it as the main problem of traffic jam in the island .
They say , " there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient " .
And for me , that 's totally non sense .
I believe that we can do it here .
In order to do that , it will cost us huge transformation .
Aside from a great blue - print of a well - organized transportation system , which covers a good 25 to 50 years planning , it also involves local culture .
It is definitely a hard job to do when we want to change People 's culture .
A conscience that a change is needed to create a better place for people to live should arise first .
People should be reminded that 50 to 100 people travelling in a bus will make the traffic so much better compared to have each two to four of them trap in car , in other words one massive transportation measure against twelve or more cars on the same road .
The next is an understanding of what we can do to nature by changing our transportation measure .
Imagine the energy that we can keep and pollution that we can stop .
We can change , we have to change for a better future .
The world is constantly changing and technology is advancing fast .
This affects people 's lives considerably , so we can say that in 50 years , the lifestyle will be completely different to what we have today .
We can say 50 years ago we had not thought to have technology currently exists , such as Internet , TV , smartphones , etc .
Also lifestyle was completely different , the industry had not developed technology that now allows you to be more efficient and several people did the work now can be done with a few of them .
So , if technology continues to advance as it has done until now , lifestyle will change too .
Perhaps in 50 years more , we will live in a world where technology makes our life much easier , but at the same time we will be depending on it .
Dear Jo ,
I was very surprised to hear that you want to spend your year off from university in my countrey and I am also extremely flattered .
As you asked for my advice I would suggest to get a job in summer because you said you would only want to work for about three months .
I would recommend a job as a waitress because you do n't need much experience , and I know you do n't have any , and if you get a job in summer as a result you 'll be at the beach most of the time and you can spend the rest of the year visiting other places .
My favourite places to visit are from the area I live in and I would strongly recommend those due to the fact that we can also meet and I would be delighted to see you again .
The place where I enjoyed myself the most was " the Bran Castle " also known as Dracula 's castle .
It 's one of the most beautiful castels , in my opinion , and it represents the most important thing this countrey is known for and that is Dracula .
He was actually one of the rulers of this countrey and he 's real name was Vlad Tepes .
The reason he used to kill people was because they did n't respect the laws .
Another attraction which is a unique one is " the merry cemetery".It is famous for the colourful paintings on the tombstones describing , in a very original way , the prson buried there and their lives .
It once was just a simple cmetery but now it is an open air museum .
And if you want to have some fun also there are some fastivals that you might enjoy .
They are quite big and a lot of important artist come .
The biggest one in the countrey is in the cty where I live threfore you 'll have a place to stay and for free .
I hope my advice was useful and I look forwored to seeing you next year the ,
Andreea
I have two different reasons to explain why I want to study again at BSC in Oxford .
The first reason is because I already have studied there three years ago and it was a wonderful experience , I met very nice people from all over the world , I improved my English level thanks to very skilled teachers and I really enjoy my stay in Oxford .
The second is a pragmatic reason I have a five year degree and I worked for two years in a medical devices company but now I am unemployed .
In Italy is quite hard to find a job at the moment and I want to try a work experience in the UK but it is necessary to become more confident with my English and that is what I hope to obtain from the IELTS course .
I already know that it could be tough , especially to be far from my family and my girlfriend , but it is something that I feel could be right for me , and for my career .
The thing that worries me most is to get used to the English weather !
Public transport is common means of transport used in many countries ; Usually transport people in mass from one location to another ;
However as the countries develop and economy grows and life change , people change and standards of life change too ; The interaction factors that lead people to have their own a car is depending and limiting on several factors ; There are also factors such as social and financial conditions that tend to influence people to have their own car instead to travel by public bus / train ; We should also consider the conditions of roads , access and traffic , giving an opportunity to people to opt and travel on own car or public transport ; In some countries there are separate lanes dedicated for public transport which help and facilitate the traffic on condition of heavy traffic ; With traffic technology solution owning a car is always better .
another factor we should consider is the public transport stops on the way to destination which require to plan and catch up public transport to avoid late arrival at your destination .
The subject , no future for public transport is ambiguous as the advantages and disadvantages are both consider on .
Welcome tourist :
This is a guide for you , I hope it can help you a little .
First at all , I want to explain the communication with the town ; a lot of people came by train , it is situated at the top of the town , is the best travel to yours because it is the most quickly , but proving that you prefer to come by bus , the bus stop is near the train station .
There are many shops around the town , for example we have one that where children can make teddy bears whereas the parents can see them from the restaurant ; many children said that it was the best place in the world .
For adults we have a little old museum , where you can live one day like sixty years ago , so If you never have been in one , you should go because it is not cost so much , besides the museum has a kinder garden for the kids .
Apart from that the town is near the beach , and there we have many restaurants where you can eat while you are watching the waves on the sea .
Our personal recommendation is the " Sir Hotel " is a muddy hotel because many years ago it had been a castle , as well you can sleep in the king bed and every night it has theatre where you can take a part in a play .
Dear Sir / Madam :
I am writing in reply to your advert , which was advertised in the local Newspaper on 31 May 2008 .
As you can see in the attached CV I have experience working with children of different ages .
During three years I babisitted my neighbor 's two daughters .
When I started they were of 3 and 6 years old and I loved to prepare crafts to do with them and usually I had to give them dinner .
In addition , the last three years I have been as voluntary in my tennis club , where I have developed different skills to organize activities , sports games and competitions for children from 6 to 14 years old .
I am an energetic , positive and outgoing person .
I enjoy doing whatever kind of sport with my friends .
Working with children I have learned to be more patient and moreover I am able to motivating them to do the best of themselves .
Also I have gained communicational skills speaking with the children and the families .
In order to work in the kitchen I am a really good cook and I used to help my parents every weekend .
Finally , although I usually speak Spanish , my second tongue is English .
Without doubts I am the person you are looking for and it is a job that I would be very excited to have .
I look forward to hearing from you ,
Sincerely
Susana .
Public transport is a useful way to commute from place to place , especially in big cities .
Besides its advantages are cheap and fast there are many disadvantages of taking bus or train such as time , quality of serving , and crowdedness .
it is said that instead of taking public transport , commuters will travel by car because of its convenience . in my opinion ,
public transport will be hardly replaced by travelling by car .
First of all , Public transport is used by many people who do not have cars like students and workers . They can afford to buy tickets .
For example , my student time , I used to take busses to go to school every day and come back home .
Secondly , The infrastructure in the big cities is not sufficient for all the cars .
Traffic jams always happen in the rush hours when there are so many cars on the road .
Fossil fuel is running out of resource .
It makes the petrol 's price increasing every day .
It has been affecting to the environment like climate change , increasing droughts , and flooding areas thanks to increasing the demands of using petrol for private cars .
In conclusion , public transport would be the excellent transportation method for the increasing demands of commuting .
Introduction
The aim of this report is to examine the available local transport usage and possible improvement .
Currently , the local transport available are buses and taxis .
Buses in need of repair
The most used public transport is the Bus .
The town is covered with more than thirty lines most of them with a duplicate performing the same path on the opposite direction .
However , Buses are mostly used by very young people and old people .
Children often use them to go to and back from school , and the older population , with increased problems seeing far away , prefer to use the bus to travel around the city .
In my opinion , the biggest problem with buses is that they are becoming very degraded , and in desperate need of repair .
Most of them do n't have air conditioning , meaning that in the summer they are tremendously hot , and some have problems with the windows that cause the bus to be extremely cold in winter .
The alternative - Taxis
For the average middle - aged person the logical option is to use a taxi .
Taxis are available throughout the city , and can be called by a simple phone message .
The bad side with taxis is that they are still very expensive , with all the extra taxes and different zones .
Recommendation
There have been rumors of the contruction of a Metro in our town .
That would be an excellent alternative to the current means of transportation , since they are fast , are n't affected by traffic , and they are generally cheaper ( since they rely on electricity ) .
Another option would be to create a system to rent bicycles ; this has been done in many cities with great results .
Hi David ,
that 's amazing , I just wanted to write you an sms and at the same time I 've received an email from you !
It 's great that your college mates want to visit South Bohemia .
I love this place so much !
I 'll recommend them lots of jewels that could be interesting for them for sure .
First of all , if they are staying in České Budějovice , they can spend there at least three days with sightseeing .
Anyway they must visit our main square with many historical buildings .
They can climb on " Black Tower " and listen to singing from the town hall .
There is a huge number of shops in the centre so what about doing shopping ? Sightseeing in this town is for tourists very convenient because they can reach everything on foot .
If the weather is nice , they could definitely take a trip to Kleť .
It 's the biggest hill where you can go on the lookout tower and it 's not far from České Budějovice .
There is an interesting observatory too and what 's more the best restaurant I have ever been in .
They must definitely order the best soup in the world .
The best way to get there is by car .
Český Krumlov is worth seeing as well .
There 's a pleasant historical centre and a monumental castle placed on the big rock .
They can see there 2 brown bears and lots of souvenirs shops too .
You can take a bus there .
I hope your friends'll be satisfied with my tips .
If you want to know more about the destination , just write me a message or give me a call .
All the best , Ivana
The statement given in the rubric proposes an issue of the future of pulic transport in developed countries .
I do n't agree with this viewpoint due to several reasons .
First of all , vehicles designed to carry large number of people can not be unnecessary in big cities .
Modern megapolises are suffering from surplus of automobiles .
It happens not only because of environmental aspect , but mental as well .
Regular citizens seem to be tired of eternal traffic jams and yards , filled with parked cars .
Thus , it is absolutely possible wish of average person , who spends most of the time in downtown , to replace a car for a bus or an underground .
The main reason is general fatigue from the huge number of vehicles around .
Secondly , taking into account of long - distance trips can not be avoided .
Whatever type of journey you took , you would be more likely to prefer using train or plane , because it would be much more convenient and would not demand any physical tension .
Mental one can not be excluded , but that is the different question .
Overall , there are a number of causes to disagree with the suggestion , that individual transport is getting more and more popular in comparison with public .
The only thing , that definitely should be changed in the future , is an approach to usage of cars powered by gasoline .
Near The Roquetas Concert Hall , it can be found a Japanese restaurant named " Ichiban " , opened a few years ago , it 's not well known yet , but this does n't prevent that quickly gets busy at the weekends at lunch time .
Although sometime it might be rather noisy , because of the people gathered there , I find its decor quite attractive and , as usual in this kind of restaurants , relaxing .
The staff is charming , helpful and pleasant as well .
However , it might be that you had to wait a while for your food to be served , but worth it .
You can choose from a variety of dishes in their menu - sushi , maki , " etc .
Different kinds of sashimi are offered - of mackerel , sea bass , octopus , butter fish .
The sashimi of salmon is my favourite one .
I have to mention the soups , especially the seafood soup .
Delicious !
It deserves to be mentioned the great variety of rice and noodles - with chicken , beef , prawns , vegetables .
All dishes are served with a careful presentation , are highly creative and very attractive to the eye .
A negative point of the restaurant , in my view , is the lack of a dessert menu .
As a conclusion , I recommend visiting " Ichiban Restaurant " , you 'll have the chance of enjoying a delicious meal in a certainly agreeable atmosphere .
Reflective Writing
I have done to take responsibility for my own learning .
Independent learning has become an indispensable part of finishing tertiary - level education successfully .
However , traditional teaching method , force - feed the students , has made me overly dependent on teachers in China , which has led me to follow teachers indiscriminately .
Compared with EAP course , it tend to be taken responsibility for finishing assessments independently , especially for academic writing .
Firstly , it was too difficult for me to hand in assessments on time , because I used to spend too much time on playing games without teachers supervision , so that I always did not have enough time for finishing academic assignments independently .
By this trend , I have became a procrastinator finally , which enabled me to face the problems of time management .
In this sense , the term , " time management " means the ability of controlling time on prioritizing tasks , and planning effective scheduling of time to balance study and work , and keeping concentration on motivating yourself to learning towards a goal ( Academic Skills Unit , 2012 , pp.22 - 25 ) .
Develop a strategy in studying is vital .
Rowh ( 2006 ) states you will stay up late for accomplishing assessments before the deadline is due without planning in advance .
Therefore , the best way is leaving 30 minutes everyday for reading and beginning to read at once .
Based on examining my actual experience and research , I noticed that a gap , unsuccessful time management in independent learning is the root cause of these problems .
Then I made a few conscious changes that I began to manage duration for finishing my homework ahead of some weeks , as well as stopping procrastinating in the most important areas of my life .
As an independent learner , it is my sole responsibility to autonomic learning , which is a very important factor in future passing EAP1 successfully , as well as giving me an advantage in terms of coping with the challenges of future Bachelor of Nursing in Australia .
The most historical place in Spain , it is the city of Cáceres .
It is in the south of Spain , there the weather is warm .
Cáceres is visited for many tourist every year .
Moreover , there are many things to see and do here .
At the beginning of the 7th century , Cáceres was conqueted by the Arabs .
They spent five centuries here .
At the end of the 14th century , Cáceres was conqueted by the Romans .
Therefore it is a multicultural and multirracial society .
On the other hand , Cáceres are divided in two main areas , the new city , which has modern and high buildings .
As well as the historical city , it is short and narrows streets .
The center of the historical city is the Big Square , there are mixed Arabs and Romas buildings , and two cathedrals .
The most important palace is Jorge 's palace .
Jorge was a kind , who won an important battle against Arabs .
To sum up , if I have to recommend a place , I will recommend Cáceres .
For several reasons .
In the first place , people are really fun and friendly .
In the second place , you would learn the history of Spain on these streets .
In the third place , this year Cáceres is the capital of the gastronomy in Spain .
My favourite restaurant is Chinnesse .
In Caceres we can eat Chinnesse food in Food house .
Some people do n't like this food , but in this restaurant you can eat other types of food , for example Spanish food and Mexican food .
The atmosphere in this restaurant is very good and very clean .
This restaurant is very big , we would n't have a problem .
Waitress and waiters are very friendly and funny .
This restaurant is buffet , we paid 15€/person and we can eat and drink all that you want .
From my point of view , this restaurant have one drawback , the waiters and waitress do n't go on the table , you should go to your food and drink .
I love this restaurant , the food is very delicious .
In this set of materials , the listening passage discusses advantages of alcohol and how they contribute to improve health , and personality and the reading contradict this by revealing down side of it .
In the listening passage , the professor discusses the advantages of alcohol and how it helps to reduce heart attacks and strokes by 40 percent , due to the fact that it reduce blood clot , and slowing the deterioration of brain function .
In addition , moderate drinking helps to keep healthy movement , because some researches has shown that people who drink moderately have less proportion of body fat , because alcohol speed up metabolism which makes calories burn quickly .
Moreover , it is stated that people who drink moderately have positive social behavior which means that they are more likely to establish contact than non - drinker , and they are more social , popular and they are likely to be married .
On the other hand , the reading contrast this by mentioning disadvantages of alcohol .
Firstly it is stated that alcohol lead to weight gain , because it has more calories per gram than any other drink , and it is mentioned in the passage that you need to walk a mile to lose calories of glass of wine .
Furthermore studies have shown that alcohol induce appetite which makes people consume more than they need .
For example researchers have found that belly fat is related to alcohol .
Second , alcohol can cause some serious health issues , especially cirrhosis of the liver , heart failure , brain damage and variety of cancers .
Third , alcohol takers tend to aggression and violence .
In fact studies shows that 86 percent of all homicides and 60 percent of sexual assaults , are linked to alcohol
With the development of globalization , there are varieties of impacts for different aspects of daily life .
People also have a discussion of its advantages and disadvantages .
This essay will describe both positive and negative influences of transportation in China by some examples .
Firstly , there is a benefit of globalization that people can buy some special products from various countries on the internet instead of buying in the production site .
So transportation of goods has become an important link for both the public and businesses .
In recent years , there are some different size of logistic companies have been hold , and different modes of transportation has developed rapidly .
For example , in the past the main transportations were ships , trains and trucks , so people had to wait long time for their parcels and letters .
However , now the increasing number of consumers and logistic companies has chosen airplanes which can save much time to transport their parcels .
Secondly , there is still a disadvantage of globalization on transportation in China .
The reason is that the development of globalization has let our country improve its economy .
However , because of the increasing standard of living , a growing number of people have chosen to travel which has brought a heavy pressure of transportation .
So in order to transport a huge number of visitors who are not only foreigners but also native people , the government and experts have to think some different ways to solve this problem .
For example , some cities like Beijing and Hangzhou have to limit the number of cars which come for traveling to decrease the pressure of transportation in sight spots and city centre .
In conclusion , globalization on the transportation has brought both positive and negative effect to Chinese people .
So in my opinion , people need to find right ways to let globalization push the standard of our living whereas discussing its advantages and disadvantages .
Bra is a small village of Italy and it is also my town .
Bra really takes care of the environment .
If you visit it you will probably appreciate all the innovations applied to save our environment .
For example all the members of the town council use bikes so they are a good example to all citizens .
So if you want a bike , to move easily , you have to make a card which allow you the access to all bikes situated in specified places in the city .
In my town cars do n't pollute .
They have green engines .
These engines use bio fuels so the environment is not affected .
I am really proud of my city because there are few .
I think if we want to protect our environment starting from the little things .
Nowadays it 's very important to be bilingual .
Speaking just your native language is not enough to work or to travel .
Moreover If you want to find good job you must able to speaking two or three language without any problem .
You should speak accurately and also fluent .
I know to speak three language .
My native language is Catalan because I 'm from Valencia .
Also I know Spanish and besides I 'm learning English right now .
I 'm living in Worcester one city from England .
I 'm au pair .
The last year I was in Poland and I could see how was important to speak English , with this idiom you can communicate with other people , no just English people if not with around the world .
When I was a child I did n't understand why I needed to learn English but now I can see how important it is , for this reason I 'm motivated to learn .
On the other hand I love travelling and in case that you know several language all will be easier .
You could understand the guide , the sign ...
you could enjoy a lot and learn more about different cultures .
On the contrary to learn language take a long time and you need to be patient .
Moreover the languages courses can be expensive in my opinion the best thing that you can do is move into other country it would be easier to stay motivated because you need to learn it to find a job or to make friends .
As far as I can see , it 's important to know languages no just your mother language .
I encourage everybody to learn languages .
It could be nice and give you more opportunity to do whatever you want and do n't lose heart at the beginning could be difficult but bit by bit you will see your progress .
With thousand years of built and fight for the liberty of our nation , we can be proud of our history .
Vietnam is a small country but had defeated two big nations which wanted to turn Vietnam into their colony .
With strong patriotism , Vietnameses nowadays are trying to develop the nation , to get in the globalization progress .
However , as a resident of the country , we can not forget about the history and about our ancestors services rendered to the nation as well as our culture and ideology .
As a reward for their efforts .
Each nation has their own historical places , Vietnam is not an outcast , we also have many historical places which help the younger generations to understand throughout about the past .
Those places will help them to take a close look about the root of our nation and learn how to appreciate our culture , custom and tradition .
We can mention many places such as Sword Lake , Hỏa Lò prison , Temple of Literature ...
Today , I will mention about one of the iconic places of Vietnam which you can not miss when travel to Vietnam .
It is Temple of Literature , the first university of the nation .
Temple of Literature was built in 1070 under the Ly 's dynasty .
In spite of wars and the destruction of time , Temple of Literature is still preserved in good shape until now .
We can still see many ancient structures which show the main trend of architecture at that time .
As many other Asian country , in the past , we were greatly influenced by the ideology system of Confucius , a philosopher from China .
He built up a system which based on 4 essential relationships in the society .
The lessons that scholars at that time were received , most of them were about his ideology .
Otherwise , they learned mostly about literature , poetry .
We can briefly describe the overall structure of Temper of Literature which consists of six parts .
Firstly , there were 3 main gates , the center one only for the king , the left side one was for administrators , the right site one was for military .
Scholars only could enter by a small gate from aside .
Then there are five courtyards from the first one to the fifth one from outside to inside .
One remarkable , featured point about Temple of Literature is the people who passed 4 rounds of examination , then gained position titles would be graved their names on the stone grave carried on stone turtles .
Right at the moment entering , you can see them from two sides of the courtyards .
Temple of Literature is a hollow place for students even now .
Before the university entrance examinations , many students come here and wish for their luck .
Temple or Literature ( or Imperial Academy ) can be seen as the most featured historical place in Vietnam .
It contains not only the history but also the culture , customs also it is the first official institute which you can not miss out .
I do a lot of sports for example : cycling , karting , football and basketball but my favourite sport is swimming because I have done this sport since 1995 with my grandfather .
I love swimmming because if you are angry or your job is very stressful , you will feel well after thirty minutes on a pool .
Also , you meet a lot of people while you practise sport .
This is a relaxing sport because while you are swimming you can think in your life .
Other good point about this sport is that you should move all part of your body .
Actually , this sport is very healthy , so some doctors are recomending this type of sport .
You can do different sports on the pool for example : swimming , water aerobics , Olympic diving or diving .
If you begin to practise this sport , you should wear goods snorkeling glasses and you should warm up five minutes before you get into the pool .
Besides , you can have could shower after and before that you do swimming , this is good because your body temperature is hotter than the water of the pool and if you get into the pool very fast you can have a problem with your body temperature .

Story
The doorbell ran .
When I opened the door imagine my surprise as there was nobody standing .
NO one at all .
I could only feel a hot , smelly stream of wind . '
There must have been a naughty child ' I thought without worrying .
Later on the week I was doing the dishes when the kitchen door suddenly opened for no reason however I felt the same hot wind in my face and the same funny smell .
That was when I first started to believe that something wrong was happening at home .
The next time it happened to me such a thing I felt no wind but this particular stink .
It was as if somebody was cooking some cauliflower .
At that time I was unemployed so I was n't able to move house and as I was n't afraid of it I had to put up with those strange events .
So I decided not to pay any attention to it and carry on with my normal life .
Now I have to admit that I have a problem I am sharing home with a ghost or two but I do n't mind as long as he or she leaves me alone .
My name is Cristina and I am 19 years old . I think I am the suitable person because I have been working with children for quite long .
My parents both have been working since I was 12 so I had to take care of my little sister , who is four years younger than me .
Moreover , I love spending time with children .
For this reason I have been doing three courses during this year .
These are quite interesting and have helped me to know deeper children 's pleasures .
I have learnt a lot of activities which let them have fun at the same time they get in touch with nature .
I am able to cook some delicious dishes too .
My grandmothers used to run a restaurant and she taught me some Italian recipes .
I have to practise more , but I think I am qualified enough to do this activity .
I am available all summer so I could start to work whenever you would need to .
I would like to know as soon as possible whether you are hiring me since I have to look for a cheap and good qualified air company which I can afford .
Please contact me if you needed any more information about me .
Best wishes .
Good afternoon .
My name is John , I 'm twentynine years old and I live in Romania .
This month on the 9'th I 'm going to have an oral and writing examination on my English language knowledge .
The English language is a foreign language for me , but I have studied it for ten years and hopefully I will manage to pass the exam .
I am particularly concerned about my speaking skills and I hope I will not be so nervous in front of the teachers .
The exam is assumed to be on professional matter .
Subjects like passport , travel document , third country citizen , inhuman treatment or punishment will be the main criteria to the exam .
I have three more days to prepare myself better , but to be honest I 'm not in the mood of studying .
I 'm going to travel all the way to the capital of my country , approximately three hundred and fifty kilometres .
I called a girl who is a colleague of mine from another airport .
She said she will join me for the exam .
In fact she will also participate in the exam .
Hopefully I will pass the exam and will attend the English course for a month .
Afterwards I will have the right to take part to the intarnational missions for maintaining the peace under the patronage of the European Union .
I wish to come back happier .
Dear Ms / Mr ,
I am writing in regard to the environmental problem you are researching .
First of all , I am going to present to you some general information about the environment in our village .
- Our village has only 200 citizens , therefore the amount of rubbish produced in year is insignificant to the environment in our area .
- There in a recycling facility near our village and 80 percent of the rubbish is being recycled .
- 60 percent of the houses in the village have solar panels .
Secondly , I am going to inform you on how our citizens are tryinq to keep the area clean .
- There are cleaning campagnes twice a year .
- There are separate rubbish bins for plastics , metal and glass in the whole area .
Lastly , I am going to explain how is our village kept attractive .
- Last year there was a campage for renewing and repairing the most attractive parts of the village .
All the important buildings and monuments had been cleaned and repainted .
In conclusion , I would say that our village is an example for environmentally conscious city .
I hope this report informed you fully on the environmental situation in our villge .
Sincerely yours ,
Kalina Yevtushenkova .
Report : How Budapest takes care of its environment ?
It 's very hard to organise a big city 's rubbish delivery system and to keep the city clean .
In connection with the first issue , Budapest completes the task very well .
In Budapest the rubbish is collected separetely .
In the new buildings there are usually dustbins for each material ( glass , plastic , etc . ) , and around the older buildings there are more and more separate dustbins .
So , almost everybody , who lives in Budapest , has the chance to use this form of rubbish collection .
It would be logical that we recycle the garbage as much as possible , and there are factories , where they use this technique , but in Budapest we usually do n't use much recycled goods recently .
And it is a serious problem , because in the not so distant future we wo n't be able the handle the garbage - it wo n't be enough space where we could deposit that .
An another ( one could say the most ) important question about a capital city is : how clean is it ?
In that area Budapest accomplishes very awful .
In spite of the number of the cleaners , the town is dirtier than Vienna or Prague .
Naturally it 's mainly depends on us : if we could put our garbage into the dustbin , instead of letting it on the streets , it would be easier to keep it clean .
However , it would n't be impossible to collect the rubbish and clean the streets more often - it 's just a matter of organisation .
Since yoga entered my life I try to change my common view of many things .
My lifestyle is among them .
Ecological situation is seriously bad not only in my city but in my country in general .
Rubbish recycle is the biggest problem in Kyyiv in my opinion .
All the rubbish is taken to the huge dump a few kilometres off the city .
What a smell !
But people mostly do n't care about it .
We keep on generating rubbish and using harmful things .
Still we use plastic bags and bottles , phosphate detergents , throw batteries away .
Not to mention diapers and sanitary towels , paper napkins and many other things .
Unfortunately we do n't separate rubbish .
Can you imagine why ?
Because recycling is hardly developed here , in Ukraine .
There 's no factories and plants to recycle all these materials , though we 've already got special yellow bins for paper and glass in the city streets .
For a very long time I 've been doing my best to separate rubbish and then , it was really bright summer morning , I saw that special yellow bin for paper and glass was emtied by the same car with the other rubbish ...
Yellows bins was carried away from our yard in a few days .
Once again there 's only one bin for every group of rubbish .

The fact that " shopping is not always enjoyable " might be considered an universal truth .
Although it is true that shopping might not be a very interesting topic , it must be stated that it is necessary .
There are many different kinds of shopping : e.g. clothes , groceries , furniture , instruments , etc .
It all depends on what you are about to buy .
When it comes to clothes there are also different kinds of people , the ones who do it for necessity and the ones who do it for joy .
The former might not be so enjoyable whilst the latter , obviously , does it for enjoyable purposes .
Groceries and furniture , as well as instruments , follow the same pattern .
It all depends on the type of person buying it , their personality and a wide range of other characteristics which will not be covered now .
In last place , it is undoubtedly influenced by the place in which you are buying ( i.e. the room , the organization , the prices , the distance , etc ) and the unknown people who are in it which may cause trouble or facilitate your shopping and make it more enjoyable .
These factors will be explained in another occasion .
In conclusion , shopping might be both : enjoyable or not .
In order for it to happen , a range of different variables have to take place .
Although there are a lot of people who strongly believe the best way of travling around the city is by motorbike , there is also a big part of the society who is sure it has too many drawbacks to be worth buying one .
Owning a motorbike has advantages .
One very important positive aspect is that , thanks to the small amount of petrol it needs , the keeping of a motorbike is considerably economical .
In addition , as it is smaller than a car , parking becomes much less complicated .
Besides , for the same reason , it is easier to avoid traffic jams .
On the other hand , motorbikes do also have drawbacks .
For example , the lack of safety , which raises the probabilities of getting hurt if an accident occurs .
Another disadvantage this kind of vehicle has is the low number of passengers who can travel on a motorbike consequently not everybody finds it convenient or comfortable owning one .
In conclusion , owning a motorbike can be useful or useless depending on the lifestyle you have , your economic status , and the number of people you need to travel with .
Have you ever been in trouble , which type of transport you should take ?
I was , too !
Let 's imagine : you can choose between plane , train and boat .
If you must come a long way , then you 'll probably opt for travelling by plane ...
It 's a good idea , but ... I 've got an aviophobia !
It makes my every journey unpleasnt and I feel uneasy all the week before the flight .
But excluding cases like mine : flying is the fastest , the most safe and often the cheapest way to travel .
We can take a trip by boat .
But this mode of transport is n't so comfortable , esspecialy when we must travel onshore , then it 's complicated because travelling by boat is allowed only by the sea or any sizeable river , which courses are usually placed less conveniently than roads or even railway tracks .
In that case it indicates that my favourite way to travel is train !
For me it has some very important advantages , like that you do n't stand in traffics , reductions for students , low risk of accidents , potentiality of sleeping , eventuality of travelling with bike or other big luggage .
Most railway lines are quite spruce and for me , travelling by train is pleasure !
In my opinion , everything depending on our preferences , but train is general - purpose means of transport , I recommend it !
My favorite sport is badminton , which I have played for seven years and touched this sport when I was in junior high .
At first , I 'm not interested in it , since I did n't any idea how to play , as I had only played basketball and volleyball , however , I did n't enjoy these two at all .
Moreover , I also did n't like to do exercise which was tired and my strength was extremely weak that every time when measure 800 kilometers I always ranked the last three .
But when I decided to sit aside and chatted with my friends , one of my male friends , who has still kept in touch at present , asked me to play together .
After he got the reason why I did n't have any desire to play , he told me to give myself a try , and if I still did n't like it , he would't force me .
Then , he taught me how to play , for example , when hitting , used the strength of the whole arm and did not just used elbow , or you would feel tired shortly .
While playing , I rejoiced at this exercise , because I have never sweated so much and felt refreshed before .
The funniest thing to me was that I thought I were a kid who studied kindergarten for the way he taught .
When hitting ball back successfully , he would say ' ' good , keep going or you did it '' .
Hitting ball again and again , I learned I loved badminton unconsciously , which not only includes running but also concentrating .
Badminton is an easy sport that everyone can try , just focus on ball and hit it back .
In addition , before playing , must warm up your body and relax your muscle after playing in case suffered injuries .
Attn . : Mrs Kate Ashby
Manager of Green Pepper Cafe
Dear Mrs Ashby ,
I am writing to apply for a chance to work at weekends in your cafe as advertised .
I am now a housewife .
Cooking for my family is one of my hobbies , and I am therefore fond of finding different kinds of food .
In addition , having been equipped with my rather good English - speaking skills and cross - cultural communication skills obtained during the working time as a receptionist for a Canadian mining company , I feel very confident and amicable while dealing with customers .
Last but not least , I am willing to work for long hours if required .
With such qualities , I strongly believe that I will do this job very well .
Another reason I apply for this job is that it will be really a good chance for me to help partly increase my income at this time and improve my family 's living conditions .
I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible .
Your consideration and acceptance of my application will be much appreciated .
Yours sincerely ,
Tong Sun Ku
The world where we live now is more suitable for young people , as many could say and prove , even though , in some countries , older people can have a decent life without depending on young people .
Unfortunately , the reality impels me to admit that young people has more opportunities to enjoy life because of all the technological advance that older people tend to not understand well .
Also , because of the fact that the urbanization have not helped most countries to adapt the cities into places more accessible to senior people .
The new technologies are something that we can not love without anymore .
But , unfortunately , the new gadgets can be very difficult to manage or master , especially for the part of the population who did not learn about them while they were children or students at the university ( older people ) .
I am one of the fortunate people who was born on the technological era , which means that I have had access to computers , gps and mobiles , for example , since I was a little child .
The technological equipment help me in my daily life in a way that I can no longer travel or even commute in my city without them .
The fact that these utensils are familiar for youth make them helpful and useful .
On the other hand , to someone who did not have these when they were more young and active , such as grandmothers and grandfathers , the new instruments are just things that they can not use nor understand .
The older people are limited in their abilities to use technology that could be valuable to provide enjoyable times at home , on the street , in a museum , etc .
Another transformation , which is corollary from the advances that humanity have been seeing lately , is the modification in the cities and our living habits .
Since last century , the world population is more present in the bigger cities , which , as a result , have been increasing in size and in problems .
The urbanization implemented by government across the decades in the cities are sometimes not suitable for all public .
For instance , older people or the ones with disabilities have great difficult to use the metro system because of the number of stairs .
My mother is a perfect study of case for me because she can not well the transportation system in Paris or New York without been lost and very tired from all the walking that she has to do when commuting .
The mobility of older people is certainly reduced if compared with a younger person .
Sometimes , the lack of solutions to the reduced capacity of movement around on big cities compels the older population to stay at home .
In this case , they do not have the possibility to go out and enjoy the benefits that cities may bring to their lives .
Therefore , the new technologies and the transformation in the cities are very beneficial for the younger part of the population who is capable of understanding how to manage the modern instruments and use all kinds of transportation .
On the other hand , for the older people , the modernisation that we experience is an obstacle for them to enjoy all that there are out there .
The Active Leisure Club
Introduction
The aim of this report is to give my opinion about the facilities and services the Active Leisure Clubs .
Facilities
In general the facilities are well preserved but the majority of the users think that the installation should have an improvement in the baskteball and tennis courts maybe the bathroom should be remodelled .
Advantages
The Club is located in the city centre and it 's very clean .
The workers are very kind and simpathetic and enjoy teaching .
In other words I could say that is the best Club I know .
Desadvantages
The activities are expensive .
I believe that it would be a good idea to fall in the cost of some activities .
Curiosly the Club is closed On Saturday evenings and on Sunday .
However , the majority of users want to use the Club at weekends and to spend their free time here .
Recommendations
It 's recommend improving the facilities , falling in the price and opening every day until 10.00 p.m.
Since car was invented , we have been seeing a large increase of cars ' production and of its use .
In early days , public transport system was n't very efficient , as it was in its beginning .
There were few buses and they would take to long , therefore waiting time was quite high .
However , as time went by , improvement has been made in public transport .
Nowadays , they got modern and comfortable and they are n't as late as they used to .
Travelling by car might be more pleasant but it can also be costly , for fuel can be very expensive depending on the current economy .
With regards to traffic , travelling by public transport can also be quicker , as there is a bus lane and no traffic for tube .
However , over the past years , people have been travelling mostly by car which seems to have led to higher levels of air pollution .
This is undoubtedly an important environmental issue that should definitely have our attention .
In spite of all campaigns aiming the less use of the car but more of the public transport , people still seem to prefer to travel by car .
Celebrities and their life take intrinsic place in lifes of contemporary people .
The process of becoming this fact real and common in our society began about 100 years ago and what is really absorbing , nearly 95 percent of advanced society can not imagine the world without any kind of information about famous people and their existence at all .
The question is if it is good to take a leaf out of their book and I am going to talk around it .
It is good to have your unique value system , but the stories about people who have been doing good affects you and your future decisions .
Probably if you hear about heroic attitude you will be able to do without doubts something magnificent as well .
In this way I think that is good to look up to some celebrities who are righteous .
The second thing is that if you are in trouble you 'll feel better than usual because of well - known dramas based on factual stories which happened to the famous people .
How the English say : better the devil you know .
There are dangers which appear because of overthinking about stars and comparing yourself to them - it is called low self - assessment .
Even if you would like to be up to date with the latest news from celebrities ' private life and professional career you have to remember that the media distorts reality .
If something is n't catchy will not catch the poeple attention .
The press editors often alter details thereupon they get selling well material .
If you believe that the media says true you are wrong .
To sum up , I believe that it is really important to strike a balance and keep it during your whole life .
Of course you can look up to the celebrities but you have to be aware of the consequences .
Each kind of guiding light help us , but the most important is to choose the right and accurate person .
INTRODUCTION
The aim of this report is to describe Schedrin 's School of arts for children and youth .
It is one of the best places in our town where teenagers can develop their artistic skills .
GOOD POINTS
The school provides lots of different activities for those who are interested in music , drawing , dance and theatre .
Students are taught by the highly qualified staff .
More than that , all the classes are free .
The atmosphere at school is very creative .
During the whole school year a great number of exhibitions , concerts and performances are given by pupils themselves and by invited musicians and artists as well .
BAD POINTS
The worst thing about the school is that not everyone can be accepted to study there .
Children have to take entrance examination .
The other thing is that students are not able to refuse attending some classes they do not like because those are considered to be a part of an educational standard for the particular artistic area .
CONCLUSION
It is definitely worthwhile to study there , although it is advised to let students choose the activities they prefer .
phenomenon of homeless people became a serious problem and many countries can not solve this problem .
The number of these people is increasing not just in the developing countries but all over the world .
In my opinion , homeless people are victims because nobody wants to live without a shelter .
First of all , being without home is a horrible problem .
One of the major reasons for this problem is wars especially in the Arab countries like Syria , Libya and Yemen .
Everyday on news We see the refugees who are in a miserable condition .
They live in tents that do not protect them of cold weather or dangerous insects .
They do not have enough food .
In addition , financial crisis , almost of the companies has a financial problem so the ideal solution for them is downsizing .
After a while the people who are laid off will not have enough money to live , and they will become homeless people .
Furthermore , children street is a result of families troubles .
Cases of divorce are increasing and many children escape and prefer to live in the street instead of home full of problems .
As opposed to the idea above , some people believe that homeless people are criminals and they cause danger on our society because they need money and food so they can steal or kill for this .
To conclude , the world has a complicated issue , so The governments and the charitable organization must take a quick decision and put a real solution to solve this problem .
The homeless people are human beings and they must take their rights in life .
Just pull yourself together , Tom !
After the second false start you 'd be disqualified and then you can kiss victory goodbye , - that 's how I mentally tune myself , - Take it easy !
There is a four hundred distance and ten barriers ahead - that 's where you 'll show what you got .
I wo n't lose , not this time .
I look around tribunes : there are n't so many people despite the fact that today an Australian Hurdle Champion of the season will be defined .
Well , may be it 's for the best - less pressure .
Although whom am I deceiving ... - I 'm thinking and nervously stretching out stiff neck .
- The pressure is so high that it can be used as a gasoline to fly to Space .
Six other sportsmen are shaking like minnow grounded by chance .
I must be looking like them from the side .
Everyone 's nervous except for Jerome Tanny , last years champion famous for his threatening prestart grin , that we all call " Shark 's Smile " .
Tanny is a human - rocket that 's warming up on a neighbor track line .
I know that my old man Navarro is the one to have sweaty hands now !
Even from here I can see his anxious look and the way he 's fidgeting on a bench .
That 's strange but before the start my thoughts as if an old steam locomotive are going to those depths of memory which really hard to get to in ordinary life .
Owing to the increase of population , human beings use more land to build houses , which leads to the decline of forest rates .
The large - scale building projects do let human have homes , but not the animals .
Thousands acres of forests to be destroyed , letting the climate change .
Our cities put off to much carbon dioxied , making the gobal warmer .
Thus , the winter becomes colder , and the summer becomes hotter .
The change of climate leads a lot of terrible things to breaking out .
The floods , droughts , and famines , all of these making great effects to human and animals , for instance , the loss of properity , the missing of people , which is not good for the development of human beings .
For one thing , animals do not have homes , so some of them become endangered species , worse still , dying out .
For another thing , human will be hard to get close to the nature , and the noises of cities will do harm to human 's health .
I think that efforts must be taken quickly to protect our homes by goverments .
Firstly , the population should be controlled , if human still increase rapidly , there is no more room for human .
Secondly , governments should teach their people how to protect the environment , such as destroying the farmland too much is a bad choice .
Thirdly , reserves should be put up to provide room for animals , and we can help the endangered animals in this way .
Finally , governments should ues the space properly , like making plans before set up building , estimating the effects to human and animals .
Yesterday , I was asked to write an article about my favorite sport .
My favorite sport is running .
Yes just running .
Most people would say that running is just the most annoying sport ever .
They would just do if they have to .
But I enjoy myself so much doing this sport even if it 's just running around .
Running keeps you fit in two ways as you get your body and you mind active and healthy .
Going for a run is the best way to get your mind free and to think about nothing .
Moreover , your brain gets oxygen and your body gets movement .
Your blood is now able to circulate easily through your vanes .
I do n't mind that everyone complains about how awful running is .
Running will ever be my favorite sport !

Dear Barbara .
What a great new !
I am very keen on PC games too .
What game are you playing ?
We should meet online to play together .
Do you know " Steam " ?
It is a great online shop where you can save a lot of money .
In fact you probably spend more money than you save , because you will want to buy all their catalogue .
Regarding your question I am playing " Trine 2 " since last week .
I recommend it to you .
It has wizards , witches , knights , thieves , goblins , but it make you think too .
Wishing seeing you soon .
Faithfully yours .
My favourite sport are slalom .
Most of the people I know do n't know what you are doing if you are training slalom .
But I am going to tell you about it .
Let 's get started with the basics .
Your position .
To ski well you need do push your body forward .
It should be a strait line trough your toes , knees and shoulders .
You need to use your muscles in your stomach to stay in the right position .
Another thing that is important is the angle .
The body parts that help you to get a big angle is your toes , knees , hips and shoulders .
A turn starts with your toes , and then your knees and then your hips .
When you start training in course you need to think about were you turn .
You should do the turn before the stick so you can start next turn right after you pass the stick .
The best thing with this sport is the feeling .
The wind blowing in your hair , the speed and that you have control of what is happening .
It also fun because you can notice that you are getting better all the time .
Personal experiences
In the first place I tell you who are the most important people in my life .
This is a question that I struggle to answer , but I have to claim the most important person in my life was and is my marvellous father .
He led me through the branch of life and taught me to know how is the best way to follow .
He is always on my mind even though he is not physically .
My mother always helps me to choose the best option too .
I must be honest and I have to comment about no less important people for me , as such my best friend .
His name is Pepe .
He is always with me even in the worst moment .
I still remember when I failed my last exam , although I passed it later .
He never left me alone .
He also cooks tasty meals and give me them .
We often go out together to the cinema , have a walk , do the shopping , meet our friends , etc .
We both enjoy being with a few close friends .
To sum up , I have to say there are too many people in my life , but few person so kind like I just mentioned .
In our modern life money has always been presented as something really important .
Many people think that you need much money to be happy .
My opinion is that a minimum of money is only necessary .
This should be enough to feel you happy like a comfortable blanket does .
It start with your work life .
At this moment you need money to acquire the necessary to build an happy life .
Without enough money you will not be able to be in good shape to work .
Also , if you get enough you will be able to acquire your own home to see your future family growing inside it .
One say that having money to buy the latest gadget feel you happy .
Actually , if it 's the case , the happiness will be only for a short time .
The time of the gadget fashion .
In conclusion , I 'm pretty sure that you do n't need much money to be happy .
You need just the necessary to get an happy long life .
The urban myth that statues could move makes the contemporary people frightened .
And the Doctor Who , Sci - Fi TV series of BBC , exteriorized this terror from the Weeping Angels .
They appeared first in Blink , one of the Doctor Who episodes .
After Blink was broadcasted , it raised common fears about statues to tele - viewers in Britain and over the world .
According to the recent polls in 2007 and 2012 carried out by the British magazine , Radio Times , the Weeping Angels were picked as the most scariest villain of the Doctor who twice by about half of respondents .
These results are interesting because Weeping Angels are not the old adversaries of Doctor , like the Daleks exterminating all organic and inorganic things in the whole universe or the Cybermen transforming all living things into cyborg .
Then , what makes the Weeping Angels frightening ?
To figure out the factors , uncanny theory is used .
Uncanny theory explains an uncomfortable sensation originated from perceiving something familiar as unfamiliar .
This weird feeling is especially caused by experiencing something dead or non - living as life - likeness .
In Blink , Weeping angels ' uncanny traits and awkward backgrounds in the drama make audience have a scary and unfamiliar sensation .
It is hard to read the Weeping Angels ' thoughts and emotions from their ash - pale face .
They look unnatural , in spite of their similar appearances with human .
Usually , they tend to hide their face , since angels could not move free when they watch each other .
And expressions in their eyes are completely lacklustre , due to the deficiency of pupil .
Also , their facial expressions are almost flat as dead pans .
These factors make angels more grotesque psycho - pass assassin .
Then , it seems that these statutes might lose their spirits , only when they got our gaze .
By the way , the exterior traits of Weeping Angels are not enough to make people scared .
But when it comes to their interior factor , the uncanny feelings are maximised by turning unconscious physiological reaction into conscious one .
The angels move and attack free , only when people blink their eyes or turn around their sight away .
However , people blink their eyes several times a minute and they are hardly aware of blinking .
After the Doctor 's warning , they may not turn our back , look away , and blink as we are protagonists of the episode .
Because it seems like , if we do that , angels will come out from TV and attack us !
Then , strangely , blinking our eyes becomes conscious behaviour .
Moreover , there are good scene settings to make people not blink by immersing audience in that situation .
In several scenes , Weeping Angels , the lonely assassins , never shift their positions and postures , even though protagonists and supporting players blink , look away or turn their backs .
Why do they not move , even if their prey is near ?
The reason is that TV viewers watch them simultaneously .
To change the pose of the horrific statues technically , directors hide the angels by actors closing and opening the door or conceal the angels behind the actors through panning cameras horizontally , for a moment .
At last , directors fade out the scenes flicking out the light bulb in basement for maximizing the threat of Weeping Angels !
At last , Blink fills people with dread about the circumstances they live in by feeling unfamiliar .
After Sally , the heroine of Blink , takes the TARDIS key away from Weeping Angels in the deserted house , they shadow her quietly , as if they might be laid there for a long time .
For instance , the angels camouflage themselves as monument of tomb in grave yards , carvings of the cathedral on the streets , and ornamental carvings in front of an antique police office .
Consequently , it makes audience unfamiliar with their circumstances .
Then tele - viewers are terrified at the basis of their livelihoods and people grab up blankets tight !
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .
She began to study at the prestigious University .
Her family was very proud of her .
She was the first of her siblings to follow that path .
That was a great responsibility for her , as well as prestige .
Anna feared , that she would have difficulties to cope up with the expectations .
However , aquaintances of her , the students at the University , comforted her .
They assured Anna that she will be granted success due to her knowledge and diligence .
Moreover , her field of studies was medicine , which was her dream .
Her grandfather , first doctor in the family , was her authority .
The greatest wish of her life was to work alongside him in the hospital .
The first step was made .
From now on , Anna would have to direct her attention to making grandfather proud of her degrees .
She intended to prove that medicine is suitable field of study for her .
MY FAVOURITE SPORT
It seems that the most popular sport in the whole world is football because it keep all people united so that is why I love this sport and not only because of that , but it makes me feel very excited and it involves a lot of emotion as well then Do you enjoy watching or playing football ?
Surprisingly when you are practicing this sport you improve your velocity and coordination too , so it could be an interesting point to taking up if you are not involved in it .
Personally what I can say is that practicing this sports make me feel strongly lively and not only when I am playing it , it also happens when I am watching it especially during the world cup .
Curiously there are many ways for taking care of yourself when you are taking up this sport so what I advise you to do is do some exercise before you go in the pitch , so it not only prevent you to suffer from spraid or other kind of injuries but maintain you active to keep your game level .
I am encouraging to those people who do not like practicing sport that it the best way to maintain your own health
In Japan , there are many rules are set in the Sento .
They are usually aiming to avoid the hygienic problems .
Potential issues such as rule violation and conflicts may be arose because the foreigners may not understand the rules .
Japanese , as pointed out by Trompenaars ( cited in Morrison , 2006 ) , is highly influenced by the values of universalism .
Similarly , the high level of uncertainly avoidance and the low level of indulgence ( Hofstede 1994 ) cause the Japanese society seems to be obedient and self - disciplined .
The main reason for Japanese that they always follow the rules is to respect and hope not to cause any confusion to other users .
Also , Japanese think highly of the enjoyment of bathing in a clean environment .
As a result in Australia , conflicts may be caused due to the high level of indulgence and individualism in Australian culture ( Hofstede 1994 ) , people may usually emphasize in their self - satisfaction and think of themselves first instead of the public .
They may not consider the public interest and not give precedence to other users .
Consequently , the bathing pool may face the hygienic problems , such as someone does not wash before bathing , and scrambling issues .
In order to achieve cost efficiency , the choice of locations and decor must be thoroughly considered .
A location whether it has sufficient quantity of water or not is the essential consideration .
Rental cost is also a limitation as it is relatively higher in Australia .
Dear John ,
I am writing to recommend a place you should definitely visit while you 're in Poland .
The place I 'm writing about is Wawel Royal Castle in Cracow .
It is not only one of the most important monuments in the whole country but also a beautiful place to visit .
It is a majestical castle conviniently located on the river .
It 's a huge breath - taking complex of historical buildings and royal gardens .
The place is fascinating , because it is loaded with history and nice to spend a day and relax in royal gardens .
I also recommend going to the vaults under the cathedral , where since the 16th century many kings and famous Polish people have their graves .
The Wawel Royal Castle is an obligatory place to see , while visiting Poland .
It is well known in the whole of Europe and many foreigners are coming to Poland just to see the Cracow city and among other things the Wawel Castle .
I also thoroughly recommend Cracow in general as a place to visit , because it is beautiful , full of other worth - seeing monuments , cute small cafes , various choice of restaurants and vivid hotels with great views on the riverside .
I hope you will describe your impressions about the city after visiting it .
I 'm looking forward to a response from you .
Yours faithfully
Evidences show that many natural system have been affected by climate changes , particularly by temperature raises .
I think it is time we start taking environmentally friendly attitudes to help the planet .
First of all , as dioxides and carbons gases have been increasing ozone pollution worldwide in big cities , awareness campaigns should be promoted to highlight the alternative usages of transportation .
Also , the adoption of bicycles and walking , for instance , seems to be a responsible attitude to the planet .
In addition , water pollution is , as well , a global problem , as so many industries dump a large amount of waste into rivers and lakes and also human waste and rubbish end up in the water .
A solution could be done by improving recycling , waste disposal and even , by cleaning up shorelines .
Moreover , life may not be possible for the future generations , unless we start from now using renewable sources of energy , like green , to promote sustainability and improve energy efficiency avoiding side effects to the planet .
To conclude , I firmly believe that we can reduce damages and global warming by adopting environmentally friendly attitudes , as the use of green and clean energy sources .
During the lesson I have been very impressed by Socrative ( www.socrative.com ) , therefore I decided to devise a quiz about HTML and CSS .
I planned a mock test about the course followed by the students as homework ( they have been spending about two weeks studying the course ) .
Students do the check ( tablet or notebook , software ) .
The teacher asks the students to report about the check results .
Students log in the website
The teacher asks if there are any problems
Students do the test
At the end of the test , the teacher shows the results ( correct answers percentage for each student ) .
Students interact with the teacher during the revision .
The teacher ask the students to comment on the results and the activity , and discuss the opportunity to repeat the activity .
This review is to tell you about the Astoux restaurant , which is situated in the heart of Cannes on the seashore .
As you enter the place you are welcomed by a very natural setting .
Sitting in any table you have a wonderful view of the sea .
The menu offers a wide variety of mouth - watering starters : it is famous for its oysters .
The main course may consist of a risotto with fish , which can be really thrilling .
It might be followed by a delicious mousse au chocolat served in a large glass as a perfect ending .
All this can be accompanied by different selections of white wines .
All the products are fresh and the chef takes great care in selecting the best quality ingredients .
In addition to it the service well accompanies the high quality of the cooking .
Despite the high price of the food , I had a pleasant dining experience .
This is the reason why I highly recommend going to the Astoux restaurant .
The room was full of things that day .
Michael came back from the school after a tedious day .
His brother Paul had been searching something in his bedroom and it seemed to be a completely mess .
Suddenly , Michael saw his brother crying and he asked him " where is my playstation ? ? " . said Paul inconsolably and he run to the kitchen .
Maybe someone came in their house and stole the game console !
Michael thought .
When both of them started to search clues around the house they did n't found out anything interesting , but after a while , they had seen several pawprints and in that moment Michael remembered a fact : He had been forgotten his dog inside the house but the puppy had disappeared !
Obviously he knew their dog Spooky had been in Paul 's bedroom taken his playstation .
As they were looking for it in the garden they realised the console was near a tree .
Surprisingly Spooky turned up and escaped with some keys in his mouth but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Vividly as the picture depicts , there are six steps to produce bank notes .
First of all , they are supposed to be desighed with great care and considerations , such as the background colour , artwork and security issues , all of which are crucial for notes .
Secondly , skilled machinists will make preparations for metal plates that are one of the most vital ways to ensure the quality of bank notes .
Thirdly , sheets of bank notes will be printed with colour on both sides , usually 50 bank notes per sheet .
In this step , special ink will be used for the images , slightly raised on the notes .
Next , it will come to the most improtant step , inspection .
Printed sheets will be manually inspected .
There are two ways for these notes after this step .
If they are good quality sheets or partially damaged , but still in good condition , they will be packaged and dispatched .
On the other hand , if they are bad sheets or in bad condition , they will be disposed securely .
Dear Daniel ,
How have you been ?
I hope the charity event you 've organised with your school was successful .
I was very inspired by your idea and decided to organize an even with charity club members in my school as well .
Now that we have a wonderful idea I thought you would want to hear about it .
I know how much you care about animals and love them , especially dogs .
The problem is that there are lots of stray dogs in the streets and they disturb people .
We decided to organize a play and donate the money we earn to a Dog Foundation .
We tried to involve many students as possible since we needed actors , costume designers and technicians .
Thanks to this event , people have learned to work as a team , improved their self - esteem and developed their social skills .
The event was very successful as we earned € 2,000 in just a day .
People who attended the event had a wonderful time .
Hope you liked my idea and looking forward to hear from you soon .
Love ,
Fulya
Just next to the desk , I would put on a small wardrobe ; given that there would have additional drawers under the bed to keep some clothes , a large wardrobe might not be needed .
I might put on a mirror on the interior side of one of the wardrobe doors .
Well , I have already explained in detail how I would decorate two of the room sides , so now I am going to tell you what there would be in the two remaining walls .
First and foremost , though , I have to say that I am eager reader ; that being said , it may be obvious why I value space so much : I need a place to put my books in .
So , resuming what I was saying , I would place two or three bookcases , filling the remaining space this way .
On the other hand , aside from my bedroom , I would love to have my own reading nook , where to read peacefully .
So , if my mental estimates are correct , there should still be enough space available to also place a little armchair , where I could read more comfortably than in my bed or in my chair desk , not very far from the window .
Oh !
, also , it would be really nice to have a footstool , too .
As far as television is concerned , well , being honest , I haven't been watching much TV for years .
So , at most , I would put on a fourteen inches one on the top of one of the bookcases .
Nevertheless , it 's something dispensable for me and , for this reason , I think I could get by without having one .
Now that I have already finished describing the arrangement of my hypothetical bedroom , I am going to talk about its lighting .
Firstly , I would only use energy - saving lights to illuminate my dream room .
Secondly , my idea is putting on , at least initially , two lamps : a white overhead one and a red desk one .
Regarding the desk is just beside the bed , the desk lamp could be used to illuminate both the desk and the bed head ; that way , placing another lamp in the furniture would be unnecessary .
Lastly , I could consider also putting on a standard lamp near my reading armchair , but I would need to actually set up and use my dream bedroom to see if it is really worth it .
Finally , concerning the bedroom colours , I believe the walls should be painted of a light colour , like white , beige or , maybe a light green . The ceiling could be the same colours as the walls or , perhaps , a darker hue than they .
I sincerely doubt that I painted the furniture , though , so they would display the colour of the wood they would be made from .
Lastly , I would like that my curtains were red , given that is my favourite colour ; however , I would use maroon , which is quite similar , for the curtains because it is more sober and , consequently , more suitable for my room .
I think a family matters much for everybody .
We do n't choose parents and children , but we can choose a good husband or a wife .
My parents divorced when I was 16 years old , so I do n't have close relations with my mom and dad .
Although I 'm very grateful to my mom for great support in the most difficult time of my life .
My mother has a lot of friends and she is quite happy .
My dad has a new family and it seems he is fine too .
My son is 13 years old and we understand each other very well .
I 'm rather a friend to him than a strict mother .
He does not conceal anything from me as I try to understand what he really needs and support him .
My husband is also my best friend as I do n't have anybody closer than he .
We speak about everything and respect each other .
Sometimes we quarrel , but it does n't last long .
I 'm happy as I have always dreamt of such a family .
I completely disagree with the statement " there is no future for public transport " .
I do believe that with time people become more conscious of the idea of cities convenient to everyone .
Despite private car is more convenient to its owner then public transport , it is not in use the majority of time and that means wasting city space for parking while it could be used as a public space .
At the same time it is not impossible to solve the task of comfort and efficacy simultaneously .
For instance network of taxi cabs with affordable prices could combine comfort of personal car and work - load of public transportation .
Nowadays all the car manufacturers accepted the task of design robot - driven car that in future would resolve the issue of safety and availability of taxi 24 hours 7 days a week .
But how is it possible to persuade citizens to make a right choice ?
Unfortunately the main method is to make private cars if not a luxury then to make their usage economically less efficient in favour to public transportation .
And underground , light tram system are still more ecological and fast .
The aim of this report is to describe the training course that I was attending last month , for a week and the activities in which I was involved during this period of time .
It turned up to be a disadvantage for me , given that I am interested in the theory .
I managed to find out very few things about the theory , due to the large number of participants .
I realised there is no time to think too much when it comes to practice , because you have to act quickly and to prove yourself and the others that you use your knowledge in order to accomplish a certain task .
The efficiency is one of the most important things in terms of time management .
I would strongly recommend this training course on time management , considering is useful not just to gain some theory aspects for those who want to be more organised , but also if you want to really manage in a daily situation .
As a result of useful activities putting theory into practice , you will have a better chance to achieve your goal .
Hi Paul ,
As I 've told you I was helping on the Linkin Park 's concert last month and I have to write you something about it .
You may thought that I met them or I got an autograph but I must disappoint you .
I was just selling tickets .
But I love this experience , I was really enjoying it .
I was there with my friend .
When we came the manager gave the tickets to us and told us to be nice .
We stood in the entrance and when the clock struck six there just appeared thousands of people .
It does n't seem but it was hard work but after the concert the manager praised us for doing good job .
And guess what was the best thing about it !
We could watch the concert without buying a ticket !
You can imagine that it was amazing , Linkin Park is the best group I know so I was really enjoying it .
I hope we will get this chance next year .
Do you think you will go with us next time ?
It 's unforgettable experience and it gave me a lot .
Please write to me soon .
Yours faithfully
Petra
This picture illustrates the process of producing cash .
The first step is to design the looking of the bank notes and then prepare skilled machinists for metal plates .
After that , these notes are going to get printed , which includes coloring them on both sides and raising the images with special ink .
The next step is the most important and it involes inspection , which means good and bad sheets are separated during this process .
Those good quality sheets are cut into individual notes and dispatched after packing and those bad sheets and notes are destroyed out of secutity aspect in the very last process .
Overall , the whole process of making bank notes has six steps and they are design , metal plates ' preparation , printing , inspection , dividing sheets into three groups and distribution or disposal .
The key step is to manually inspect the notes .
I am not at all agree with that .
No future for the public transport ?
, of course there is future for it and every day more and more .
Green house gases have put a red light warning on the planet , and countries around the world are starting to realize the importance of reducing these gases .
One of the measures that we , as world citicens , can take is to leave our cars at home and start to take public transport or to share cars with others .
Big cities are crowd with vehicles and as result levels of pollution are dangerously increasing .
This is developing diseases and alergies that are affecting the citicens .
That is why , many cities has close their centres to private cars and only allows public transport .
Enginers are studying new engines that are more nature friendly , but even so , we have to reduce vehicles to help reduce green house effects and pollution .
Plans and programmes are being developed to reduce the number of cars driving throuhgt the cities .
Some of these oave the same destinations .
Use public transport is a way to be green and help to improve our planet and that is a very important task for all of us .
I do not agree with the statement that there is no future for public transport .
In recent years , public transport is really common in our lives .
From the Metro system , the bus , the train , and the high speed rail , all these public transportation become more and more popular .
Lots of people really enjoy the moment when taking public transportation because they are more convenient , cost less and more eco - friendly .
In my opinion , taking public transport is more convenient .
We do n't have to drive by ourselves , and we do n't have to think which way we should go to reach the destination .
What we have to do is simply go to the public transport stations and there will be vehicles that will take us to anywhere we want .
Additionally , taking public transport cost less .
Compared to driving a car , it only cost us about 20 N.T. dollars or at most 50 dollars for one single travel .
We have to pay for the oil if we drive and we all know that the oil price goes up every year .
As a result , I think more people will prefer to take public transport rather than driving due to the high price of the oil .
Finally , taking public transport is more eco - friendly .
Our mother earth has suffered from air pollution for a long period of time which leads to greenhouse effect and the rise of the average sea level .
We do n't want these natural disorders to continue .
Taking public transport can effeciently reduce the emmission of carbon dioxides and will help the earth to recover from those disorders .
So , as a member living in our mother earth , we should do our best to protect her .
From this point of view , I do n't think public transport has no future .
The above reasons I mentioned explain why I do not agree with the statemant that the public transport ha no future because travelling by car is more convenient .
Can you imagine a transportation which never appears ?
You may think of the time machine , it would only be seen on movie .
However , it wo n't be probably be invented after all .
Is there no future for public transport ?
Since a century , many transports have been invented , therefore our lives become convenient .
We can easily travel around the world .
What transportation do we need and should be invented now is hard to think , because no place we could n't go .
I think the transport nowadays are perfect .
Although the public transport is enough for people need , it can be improved its function .
For example , the speed of transportation can become faster , using green energy sources , improved the capacity of the public transportions and so on .
With the advance of technology , a lot of problems have come to pass , the natural resources are becoming in storted , and the air pollution is getting worse .
This is harmful to everything in the world .
So , we have to consider how to improve theses problems for our next generation .
Learning of another language is very useful these days , because of globalization and also cooperation between countries .
It is importatnt when we work or study in international area .
It can have benefits but also some drawbacks .
Firstly I would like to write about benefits .
People who are learning another language or more languages have more opportunities in their life .
It can have influence at their work .
They can have better position , work for foreign company , communicate with foreign companies etc .
It can be the benefit at school as well , because if you need some information for some project , you can look at foreign literature too .
Also you can be part of travelling and working experience which can offer to you your school .
If you want to try this option , you need to have a very good level of particular language .
It is very good that these days schools offer you more languages for learning to choose from and they recommend learning at least 2 foreign languages .
Of course it can be different in each country .
Another very important benefit of learning new language is that you can travel you will understand people abroad and you will know how to communicate with them .
It helps you to ask people on many important information which you need during your journey .
For example , which way you should go , where is good restaurant , how to travel in a country , how to solve your problems , where is the cheapest accommodation and much more .
Thanks of learning another language you can have also friends from all the world and you can better understand the culture of new country .
And what are the drawbacks ?
I think that there is not many disandvantages of learning another language .
One of them can be that people who do not understand this language will try to ask you all the time to help them .
It can be really interrupting if it still continues .
And sometimes maybe you do not want to hear what are people speaking about in foreign language .
In conclusion I would like to say that the learning of another language will be always important for today 's people and new generation too and in addition it will increase need to communicate in another language .
Hi Maria José ,
I am writing to you in reference to the First Certificate exam .
It 'll be a pleasure reporting that the tests were passed with flying colors , for that I ask for your help .
You told me that you have a shared folder with some learning tools to pass this exam .
I found a bilingual Spaniard ( with several international certificates and now he 's teaching in a bilingual school in Madrid ) .
Our idea is to talk at least twice a week .
I 'm afraid because I think that the next exam in March could be a bit soon , but if I could have a look to some tools I 'll be relaxed .
Also , I found some books on the internet with Crambridge 's exams .
Thank you for your attention .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Best wishes ,
Adrián Mares .
PS : Merry Christmas and a Happy New year !
With the process of the globalization , people are eager to know the other country than ever .
In the past , most people consider the museum as the best way to get along with the unfamiliar land .
However , the situation has already changed .
First , as the technology developed , we may find visiting museum is far from convenient .
People using new technique has gradually constitued the majority .
The online visiting is a good point in this case .
The Forbidden City , one of the most famous museum in China , has opened its online version to the public , which means people can visit the Forbidden City on the Internet instead of taking a time - consuming flght to Beijing where the museum locates .
It leads to an increasing number of people choose to using the online museum .
On the other hand , needless to say , the limitation of museum is that it can only store some pictures and paintings , it is far from an enjoyable visiting when you can only see the picture 2 meters away and no touch .
The scenery , the beauty of mountain and river , can only be enjoyed when you travel there on youe own .
Once I visited the museumm finding some pictures of the cave painting in France , but when I got France to see the real painting , I found it is more vivid and can show you how great the France caveman who painted it .
Admittedly , the museum has its owm merits;it is easy to find on the map and always be emphazised as a symbol of a country .
However , more often than not , the high price of the ticket of the museum can ruin the fun when you get to the coutry .
A documentary , a book about the culture is cheap and easy.we can consider it a ecomomical method .
Visiting museum is undoubtedly a good way to konw about a country , but not a best way anymore .
If you decide to find some information about a totally unknowed land , the museum is not a wise option .
The home of the future .
That sounds a little bit like a name of any sci - fi or horror .
But why ?
Will our houses look so terrible in a 40 years ?
Will they fly in the sky ?
Or will they be made from iron and have strong door and barred windows ?
Will we even go out on the street ?
But do n't panic , let 's think rationally .
Technology will control our homes .
With technology we will clean our house , technology will protect us , with technology we will spend our free time .
In every room we will have a big screen , where we 'll be able to see , where are our children and if everything 's ok .
Our fridge will tell us to buy a fresh milk , if there 's no left .
Our bed will tell us when to go sleep .
I have only one question .
Will we live in that house alone ?
Do we need friends or family members if technology can take care of us ?
Machines can tell us lots of imporatant information .
Does it mean that contact between people will disappear ?
I think it 's something nobody wants , but it can comes true .
People use machines and robots because they do n't want to waste their time .
But maybe they could stop talk to each other , because it 's waste of time too .
I hope , It will never happen .
Better live in a cottage .

Writing task : Informal letter
Dear Jenny ,
How are you doing ?
As you know I 'm planning to go to England to brush up on my English .
I really appreciate it if you could give me a piece of advice about what course should I take .
I 'd like you to take into account the following requirements .
Firstly , my main target is to improve speaking and writing skills as I do n't feel confident enough to do such tasks .
Selected college should be used to teaching these matters properly .
Secondly , I 'd like the college to be located not too far from accommodation if possible . I would n't like to spend too much time on public transport every day .
As far as accommodation is concern I 'd like bed and breakfast included in the price .
Finally , my overall budget amount 900 pounds .
Would it be enough for a two - week course in England ?
If it 's not please let me know .
Well , we 'll keep in touch and thank you very much for all your help .
Best regards
Juan
Summer camping is all about providing fun activity in a safe environment .
Working with kids makes fun and safety a high priority .
In my opinion , to be a suitable person for the summer camp job you should have qualifications to create fun activities and to keep kids safe .
Creating fun activities is an important role of the summer camp workers .
As a father of three boys and one girl aged 7 - 10 years , I have the ability to create and perform fun activities .
In the last summer , my kids and I created a fun morning and afternoon program for our neighbors we called it " multi - balls multi - fun " .
In the morning program , the kids have enjoyed playing football , soccer ball , basketball and water ball .
The program has included many competitive activities that full of fun and cheerful .
In the afternoon , the kids have enjoyed a multi - dance program that has different international dances .
the kids have loved learning new dances and cultures
Safety is a core component in the summer camps ' activities .
while designing fun activities , the camp workers have to take in concerns the safety level for these activities , the possible harm and the protection and treatment supplies that might be needed .
As a retired nurse , I have a high sense of safety and harm prevention .
I used to assess and treat many injured kids during my work journey in many hospitals .
In addition , I have the experience in providing the basic , the advanced life support , and the airway protection .
While these situations are rare , they need an effective fast intervention to save kids ' lives .
In conclusion , I think providing fun in safe environment is the main component in summer camp that each family is looking for . as a father and a nurse I have the ability to create the fun , to provide safe activities and the most important is my ability to intervene in the emergency situations
Foster Hollywood is an American restaurant in the center of Caceres .
It is a popular place .
The interior is spectacular because it is decorated as the film of Hollywood .
The tables and the chairs are very beautiful because they are as in the American films but they are very inconfortable .
The atmosphere is quiet and relaxed but always it is crowded .
The waiters are very friendly and helpful .
I love this restaurant because the food is really good is the tastiest food that I have eaten .
My favourites dishes are the " Nachos " and " Catarapi " , the second is a dish of spicy pasta , it is spectacular .
The service is very fast I believe the people eat good and fast .
The price is a bit expensive , but it is a great place for lunch or dinner with the friends .
I think this restaurant would be suitable for us because it is a great place for all , it is in the center and the most important her food is really tasty .
So I always recommend go .
Yes .
We can get a lot of up to date information around the world through watching television .
There are many channels on TV , not only entertainment but also technology , health , environment , weather forecast and news channel , etc .
So , it can really educate people .
News on TV tell us what is happening in the world .
Health channels give the ways of living with healthy lifestyle .
Weather forecast points out to prevent from violent storm , rain , snow , etc .
Discovery channel is the knowledge bank and animal planet is very interesting .
Moreover , nowadays many education channels are developing to help the students .
Mathematics , English and environmental knowledge Quiz programs on TV aid the mental development of children .
We can also improve our moral attitude by watching the discussion and speech by the outstanding leaders .
So , I think advantages and disadvantages of TV mainly depend on the watching person .
We can make good use of time from TV and we can also waste time with some useless channels .
So , we need to try to get equal balance between entertainment and education from TV .
By doing this , we can gain bird eye view without much effort .
Dear Sir
I have seen your advertisement on the Internet and I am really interested in it .
I am a qualified educator and I have worked with children for five years .
Because of this , I have learnt many activities and games that I could use in your summer camp .
I have also taught English to Spanish pupils so language will not be a problem .
Although I only know dishes from my country , I could learn more about your meal because cooking is one of my favourite hobbies .
I always work with many children , so I have experience managing and organising groups .
About my personal characteristics , I am friendly and self - confident but I have another quality that children loves : I am really creative , I can make costumes with not many materials so they will enjoy a lot dressing them up .
I usually play sports like tennis or running but specially I am interested in living adventures , and I would like we could live this one together .
I enclose my CV to complete information .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully

culture .
It would be incredible if you start your trip in Cartagena which is a caribean and tropical city .
It is so warm

By the way , my boyfriend will finish PhD program this summer :-) , and then he needs to do compulsory military service begin 7th August for one year .
Fortunately , he is assigned to substitute services , so he does n't to enter real army .
We think that will be convenient for him to apply the Postdoctor position during the period of military service .
His ideal plan is he will try to apply the Postdoctor position this fall or winter , and then he can work abroad after finishing the military service ( August 2015 ) .
To take public transport or not that is a question . Travelling by car is convenient , however , it
ignores the car congestion problems and the pollution for the CO2 .
Yet , to me public transport is my
preference .
Public transport reduce the car congestion problems .
Since the public transport , it decrease people
work or travelling by car .
For example , taking the train form Taipei , the city in Taiwan , to Taoyuan in the newyear just costs half an hours in contrast nearly two hours awing to the car congestion in the highway .
Besides , take the train instead of car may make a new friends possibly if chats with others besides the seats .
Therefore , public transport is the best option to me .
In terms of protecting environment , taking the public transport may cut down the carbon emmittion .
Because there are nearly 70 billions people in the world if everyone travelling by car even the half , the pollution will be the burden to the world .
It is the urgent timing to avoid greenhouse problem that people should think how to decrease the carbon emmition .
To be brief , taking the public transport is not only avoid congestion problems to save the time but benefit our mother nature future .
Admittedly , travelling by the car has its merits such as more convenient to everywhere we want , can enjoy the time with family in car .
Nevertheless , it cost a lot of problems and pollution .
For the better life and world why not take public transport .
Tom was so happy because he finally won the prize .
He attended in a local motorcycle race and won the 5000 $ cash prize .
He did his best for this race .
Three consecutive years he attended in the local race but at most he could get the second rank .
This year he found a good trainer and 6 months training made him fully ready for this race .
He went to coffee shop .
In there he saw an old man who asked him for help .
The old man said to him my son needs surgery today or he will die .
Tom asked him the cost of surgery .
The old man answered 20,000 $ .
Tom asked him about the insurance and the old man said the insurance only pays 5,000 according to its commitment for this kind of disease .
Tom told I can give you 5000 $ but what can I do for the rest of this amount ?
He thought I should perform a show to jump over the several wrecked cars but it was too risky because he had not any experience in this kind of show .
Moreover , he needs some people to advertise for the show .
He talked to his trainer Jack and explained the problem .
Jack said I know someone who can do that but how we organize the show .
We need advertising and to find a suitable place for show until 3 pm .
Tom called his friends and asked them to advertise by any means they can and also he requested his trainer to talk to the owner of the race road .
It was 5 pm and too many people came to see the show .
Tom yelled : ladies and gentlemen , please help us as much as you can because all of the income of this show is paid for surgery of a sick boy .
Tom sold all of tickets quickly and earned enough money .
The old man became very excited and glad .
His son was cured and in recovery room Tom visited him and they became friends .
It was 10 pm when Tom arrived home .
Although it had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
A short - term and enticing Russian loans are very attractive for Serbian politicians who are struggling with the financial difficulties .
Because of the quicker effects they are more lucrative for the elite than the long - term reforms required by the EU .
As an Orthodox and Slavic country which is yet to become a member of the EU and does not want to become member of NATO , in a difficult economic situation with public exposed to strong propaganda , Serbia , is an easy target of Russia 's soft power .
People were changing during ages and in the same time they were building astonishment history .
They were thinking how the world would look like and with that thought civilization was created .
Nowadays we are in the same situation .
Future is one of the biggest question for us .
Our curiosity is not restraining .
I want to give an example how would look like the Home of the Future .
The first question is where our homes would be located .
Will it be Earth in general ?
There are a lot of places where people are setting theirs houses , perhabs we will be living under water ?
Many buildings like skycarpers are suggesting living in flats which exist above the ground and it is not extraordinary , but how about whole cites prospering under the water with it own source of light which could replace the Sun .
Likewise location , something which could change are the materials with which we will build houses .
Our main goal should be creating homes with renewable materials which might be available to everyone and cheap .
That way of thinking could bring us a better world without homeless people .
Despite the fact that visual aspect is the most important thing to most people in my opinion in this case everything was said and no new forms could be created .
To summarize the Home of the Future will bring us not only a new kind of home , but also a new outlook on life .
Good morning , everyone !
Today I 'm going to introduce a book about nature that I 've read recently .
The book is called " Living Through a Natural Disaster " written by Eve Recht .
The reason I chose this book was that it is really comprehensive in showing you that different parts of the world are suffering from disasters , for instance , the Cyclone Tracy in Darwin , Australia ; the Yellow River flood in China and a devastating drought in Central America etc .
It concisely depicts the devastation and destruction caused by natural disasters .
The book is also very readable , not only introducing the disastrous effects of disasters but simply gives us an overview of handling natural disasters , so anyone can get to know the geographical phenomenon .
The most engaging and intriguing part of this book is that the people who live along the Yellow River , how they suffered from the flood and how they handled the devastation and make a better solution .
At the beginning , the Yellow River was always unleashing terrible floods that swept through towns , villages and farmland .
It became a mass killer and make people homeless .
People were forced to flee by boat because of the flood .
People living along the river wanted to prevent the flood coming again by building dykes .
However it made the situation worse .
After day of heavy rain , the water level became dangerously high because the riverbed can not withstand the water when it out of its limitation .
The Yellow River overflows and the crops on the plains are ruined in some areas .Fortunately , the flood also makes the plains fertile and feed millions of people .
While I was flip - flopping through the pages , I let my imagination run wild with the story .
Let 's think about how we treated our mother of nature before .
Now she is extremely angry after human beings did something really hurt to her .
After all , she is very kind - hearted and always helps us have a good living .
Even though the mother of nature is complicated sometimes , she would give us a light of hope .
She never just shuts one door , and she also opens another one .
According to what Charles Dickens said , " it was the best of times " , because the people can get rewarding from the nature and get a better life because of the fertile land which can feed us .
However , " it was the worst of times " also .
People will continue suffering the dangerous floods and there is no end after many years unless the government take an effective action to stop flooding .
It is arduous for people living in devastating surroundings .
The Yellow River is a combination of history and modernization .
It carries a lot of memories from the past to now , whether it is cruel to people or not .
Reading this book is like unwrapping a present which is packed in layers of sheets .
My heart grieved at every word portraying the suffering of the people in the Yellow River .
Meanwhile , a surge of sympathy and despair overwhelmed me with lots of thought - provoking words .
I sincerely recommend this book to everybody who wants to broaden their horizons and know more than you have known already .
That 's all for my presentation today .
Thank you for listening !
I agree with the idea that sporting events can be necessary for international relations and national unity .
In this essay , I will think about the effects of these popular sporting events .
The World Cup , Olympics and other international games work for easing tensions among different nations .
For example , North and South Korea are two countries against each other , but every year they still have a friendly football match .
During that time , the fans and the players are the same harmony in unity and friendship .
The fans , supporters shout , they even cry together .
The sports game events are opportunities to strengthen the friendship between the nations .
On the other hand , some sports matches can make international relations worse .
Sometimes the sports games are full of tensions over flow .
The patriotic emotions explode in unaggressive way .
For example , during the semi - final first leg AFF Cup 2014 between Vietnam and Malaysia team , the players played quite violent , the supporters of the two teams were very tense .
Even after the end of the match assaults occurred between supporters of the two teams .
I think that international sporting occasions can be one of the best ways to ease tensions or to release patriotism safely .
However , I believe that games can not be the fundamental ways for the sound patriotism or peaceful international relations .
I am very interested in this management trainee - marketing position with your corporation , and believe that my education and employment background are appropriate for the position .
During my tenure at the University of economics and Law , I have noticed my growing interest in marketing and public relations .
Last month , I interned at the Hoan My Medical Corporation in Ho Chi Minh City .
My position entailed developing marketing content on the web pages and slideshows publicizing the success of the society 's event .
I was able to utilize my marketing skills to assist the organization in their goal to promote SEO .
The marketing departerment also gives me the responsibility of publicizing events via Facebook .
I believe that my experiences in marketing and interpersonal skills make me a prime candidate for this position . I am a diligent worker , and passionate about my work . I will be a valuable asset to your company and will use this as an opportunity to grow and further the development of my marketing skill set .
Thank you very much for considering my application for candidacy .
I will follow up within a week to confirm that all of my materials were received and hopefully set up an interview time .
People 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
If we watch how society is going nowadays , we notice some aspects that let us think about human condition .
First of all we can define ourselves " slaves of the technology " because now we all have a telephone that have lots of functions and that turn us away from real life .
This can be seen in teenagers , who seems to prefer to talk by telephone than " face to face " , and also in children , who prefer play with video games on their own than going to the park
In my opinion the obsession for the business trasforms society in a ring in which every man will be against his friend only for an excellent career .
The last point that has changed people 's life is the tendency to have the same thougths or the same goods .
In this way everyone is the perfect copy of someone else and the originality or a creative mind is considered as something bad .
There are also positive aspects , for example there is a progress in the subject of medicine or in the use of the eco - resources .
Will people 's life change again ?
Yes it will and I hope that we will improve our thought and we will have the cosciousness that we are not " supreme " and that we will never have the right of imposing us in the world .
Nowadays it is possible to listen to various types of music .
What is the reason for making music necessary for us ?
Is national music more important than foreign music , which is heard all over the world ?
Taking acceptance the strength of music , it is hard to imagine human life without it . "
Music is the nutrition for our souls " said in the popular proverb .
Therefore , we can feel the enormous role of music in our lives .
To my mind , beautifulness of music does not depend on its sorts .
People enjoy it and do not think about its genre .
For example , there are various music competitions Eurovision Song Contest which organized in many countries .
People almost from all over the world attends to participate in it .
Being the core of culture of a country , it influences on national fame .
For instance , in our country music consists of two main parts : Mougam and Folk music , which have been getting popularity from all regions in the world since it was sprung .
However , modern music is not always acceptable for different people .
Despite that it is held by the majority of countries .
To take account that it has been improving day by day , we can meet the appearance of very exotic and amazing mixtures of modern and national music almost in every country .
Most of the countries enjoy such intertwining that could be considered as a new type of music .
Inasmuch as this process makes peoples close to each other encouraging them to corporate and befriend .
To sum up , it is necessary to point out that there is not any negativeness or perfectness of national or modern music at all .
It is essential to treasure music as one of the significant kinds of art .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .
But to begin with Anna for a long time was n't famous at school .
She prefer books , quiet places and that kind of thing , boring for elite in our school .
She always was the best student in the class or even in the school for a couple times .
She very focused on learning .
She had a dream to be a lawyer and wanted to help innocent people .
She was always involved with school trips connected with political places like court or government .
One a day she decided to pass away all of this thing and get started something completely different .
She forgot about books .
Unfashionable clothes turned into fashionable dresses .
Anna became a model !
She became really popular in all school , everyone wanted to spend time with her .
She is pretty , smart and so nice for all people .
And for now she is one of the most popular models in the world not only in the school .
Day when Anna decided to be a model was the most important in her life .
Dear Jo ,
I 'm very happy for reading your letter and that you come to my beautiful country .
I think that Spain is an incredible country since it has all kinds of landscapes : mountains , beaches , lakes , and you can enjoy adventure activivities , for example , trekking routes , climbing , bungee , surf ... You can make different tourism depending on the city where you want to go .
First of all , I would like to talk about Extremadura .
Extremadura is in the West of Spain and it has a good weather all year .
However , I recommend travelling to Extremadura in Spring or Autumm because in summer it is too hot .
In Extremadura you can enjoy the environment and you can walk across the famous Monfragüe Nacional Park or Tajo - International Natural Park .
Moreover , you can swim in the cold water of Los Pilones ( I recommend you this place because it is an incredible and quiet place and I love it ) or small natural lakes on the North of Extremadura .
Also , Extremadura has many towns and cities with an impressive ancient neighbourhood , for instance , Cáceres , Mérida , Trujillo , Guadalupe , Alcántara ...
Other places that I would recommend are : the towns of the South of Andalucia which have clean beaches , cold water and a good leisure with many restaurants , shops , parks , zoos , aquatic parks ...
On the other hand , near Mediterranean Sea there are a lot of towns with fantastic beaches which water is very clean and warm .
In particular , I recommend you to go to Baleares Islands .
However , if you want to go there , you must fly or go by ship .
In addition , you can visit the North of Spain since it is very beautiful with marvelous landscapes and beaches .
In the North of Spain the weather is colder than the rest of the country , for this reason , the water of the beaches is very cold and it is very difficult to swim there .
However , you must go and know these unforgettable places .
You say in the letter that you want to work for three months . I think that you can try look for a waiter job in the towns with beaches during the Summer months .
It is easier to find a job in the beach than finding it in the centre of Spain .
I 'm looking forward to seeing you .
Best wishes .
Bea
Yesterday , Tom woke up at 7 o'clock in the morning as he usually does .
He took breakfast with his father that took him school , as he always do .
That morning , he had math and after he had a science class .
The first one was very boring for him because he was very tired and he was n't about listening everything that the teacher was saying .
Tom loves asking questions himself about life and thinks that science class is the only that can solve his questions .
Those questions are : Where and how do we come from ?
And many more .
When science class arrived he felt really excited because John , the science teacher , told them that he was going to explain them a very interesting thing .
It was about what problems are we going to have in a few years if we do n't change anything related to contaminating our environment .
John talked about the serious problems there are caused by not recycling things as plastic bags , bottles … that end up floating in the sea because humans do n't take care of our environment , and all this is causing that loads of acuatic animals expire .
When Tom arrived home , talked to his family about what have he learned in science class and talked their parents to start recycling .
It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .

Dear Madam / Sir ,
My name is Marco Bruno .
This is to apply for the position advertised concerning the USA SUMMER CAMPS .
I am Italian , 30 years old .
Due to my background I believe to be the ideal person for the abovementioned job .
I have been working with children since I was aged 16 .
I have been involved in summer camps with children from different background and diverse needs .
In particular , I have been dealing for 10 years with children with disabilities .
Such experience has been an eye - opener for me .
I had the chance to be introduced to a different world and I started looking at the daily life with differnet eyes .
Children can indeed teach you a lot , being able to express their feelings with the spontaneity that adults often lack .
A few years ago , I had also the chance to work for 1 year in a school for disabled children and youth in a rural area of Ghana .
It was impressive to see the strength showed by those children .
Being raised in an environment where personal autonomy is the core , children with disabilities were growing very independent and strong , despite all the challenges they could face on the way .
During the year in Ghana , I was part of a team of volunteers working with children .
After consulting some children 's representatives , we organized Olympic games for the children attending the schools of the area .
You do not need much to make children happy and let them enjoy the positive energy given by sane sports competition .
As volunteers we were also helping the cooks of the schools in the kitchen and in the dining room .
Moreover , I had the chance to share with them the recipe of Italian pizza .
Since they were already baking bread , they quickly learned how to make a delicious pizza as well .
In conclusion , I believe to meet the requirements of the job and I kindly ask you to consider me for it .
My experience with children from different ages and Countries makes me a suitable person for the position advertised by your Esteemed Company .
Thanks in advance .
Sincerely ,
Marco Bruno
TENNIS AND NOTHING ElSE
WHY TENNIS
There seems to be nothing better , nothing more interesting , exhiliring , breathtaking or stunning just as taking up this sport .
It ca n't be compared to anything else if it comes to all emotions and feelings which are connected with playing tennis .
Being on the court , it appears to be funny , gives me a feeling of fulfilment .
PREPARING FOR THE GAME
Not everybody knows how much devotion and determination requires being a good player .
You just surely have to work your fingers to the bones but it 's definitely worth .
It 's also not said but tennis is one of sports which causes an enermous amount of injuries , so that 's necessary to be under constant control of your doctor !
Despite all obstacles , I would n't change this entertainment on anything else .
The amount of pleasure which I can get it 's simply incomparable to anything else .
ADVICE AND RECOMMENDATIONS
If I were to start my new sport career , I would choose a good medical care at fist .
Maybe it 's not a vital part of being a well known sportsman but it 's important when you want to work something off during your career .
The second thing , it 's a quality of an equipment .
There are a lot of bergains and cheap items on the market , which very often catches our eye but I want definitely warn you against it !
Do n't be mean and spent as much money as it 's needed .
I hope that you wo n't hesitate any more and that you start playing tennis at the moment !
The Home of the Future - in what ways homes will be different in the future and in what ways will be the same ? I think that is many reasons to consider both of this options .
In terms of differences is that this houses will be modern , more secure , economic .
Most of the furnishings will be a machine and domestic activities will be done for us .
However , they will lose the atmosphere of houses with antique furniture and interior , which create the unique and familiar atmosphere .
What will be the same ?
Surely people who will live in House of the Future .
Everything is going forward , so everything will be changed .
When I first watched the game between Green Bay Packers and Detroit Lions I was in stuck .
It seems like a bunch of armed men is trying to beat each other asses .
Nothing else .
And suddenly there 's a ball .
And one lucky receiver tries to deliver to the end zone .
First of all it 's a man sport , simple and simultaneously complicated .
I think it 's the best sport to watch in the whole world .
To be a fan of NFL team is very special experience .
It 's the great show , by the way .
If you enter the world of NFL brutality , rivalry and love you should know that you stay here forever .
If you plan to play this game you definitely should be an outstanding athlete . You should understand " pros " and " cons " of every move you make on the field .
And of course you should be a team player .
As they say " There 's no I in " team " , but there 's " I " in win " .
So it is what it is .
I 'm friendly , open mind and quite easy going guy who live in one of the most beautiful city of Russia - St. Petersburg .
I love my city and I love to travel , try a new things , socialize and experience a new cultures .
Working as IT engineer , I can afford 2 - 4 short term trips per year , and I always take this chance .
I can show you cool places step apart from beaten path in my hometown .
Since I have full - time job I could join you at weekends .
I would like to meet new friends all over the world and have a great time together .
I can share my knowledge about Finland and other countries .
I would like to help people in my best way I can .
I would like to learn from others about the world , people , cultures and idiomas and share this knowledge with others and be helpful in return :)
Dear Mr. Hooper ,
Introduction
the aim of this report is the desciption of the shopping facilities in my home town - Vienna .
Vienna is the capital of Austria and located in its east .
Findings
Vienna contains a lot of great shopping areas , that is why I am going to speacialse on the three most popular places .
Conclusions
I would like to start of with one of the most renownedly malls - called " Donauzentrum " .
It is situated in Kagran and can be easily reached by subway .
It covers about 60 shops .
The mall is linked to an entertainment section , called " Donauplex " .
The Entertainment section stays open after the mall closed .
There you can find a cinema , some restaurants and bars .
On the countryside you can find the recently edified mall named " G3 " .
I would recommend you to go there by car .
It contains nearly the same shops as the " Donauzentrum " and several restaurants and cafés .
The " Mariahilferstraße " is the perfekt place for people that want to avoid overcrowded malls .
This street is one oft the most popular shopping streets of Vienna .
Even the most extravagant shops can be found there .
It is not only worthy to attend the street by day but also by night .
Beside the shops some nice bars and restaurants can be found .
Recommendations
To not to lose the track I am going to give review .
Espacially on a rainy afternoon the " Donauzentrum " and " G3 " are the prefekt way to spend your day .
To people who prefer spending their time on the countryside I would commend a visit on the " Maria Hilfer Straße " .
Yours faithfully ,
James Mehler
Good morning ,
I 've just read your advertisement for the USA SUMMER CAMPS , and I 'm really interested in it .
I 'm a 17 years old Italian student , I have a B1/2 English level , I 'm cheerful and hard working .
I 'm also a volonteer among the red cross association , so I 'm used to look after children and organise all kinds of events .
I think I 'm suitable for every work because I 'm sporty and sociable and above all I think I have enough willpower to manage and carry out every work you will choose to give me .
Does the accommodation belong to the summer camp structure ?
Or is it just near there ?
As I live in Milan , I hope you will answer soon , so if I have a positive feedback , I 'll have enough time to book the flight ticket .
Thank you so much for your attention ,
Monica Conti
I live in a village on the outskirts of Milan .
I 'm happy to live here because the air is clean and fresh and we have o problems with the rubbish .
Every house has a place to put all the rubbish and people come every day to pick up the trash .
We do the collection , to recycle as many things as possible .
All the building here have been built to respect the environment , in fact every house has photovoltaic panels on the roof .
These panels are used to bring the light of the sun to produce electricity .
The first Sunday of every month , a group of volunteers goes in the parks of the village to clean it and to cut the grass .
I always participate in these events because I love the environment and I 'd like to keep my village clean .
Italy is famous for the typical food and culture rich of arts and history .
We all know that the Roman Empire affected a lot Italian culture and history , in fact if you want to go on a tour around the most beautiful cities in the country , you should definitely go to Florence , Venice , Naples and many others ..
You will be able to see ancient and modern building such as theatres , churches , cathedrals and civil buildings built by the most famous artists in the entire world !
Cities are full of museums where tourists can see all the customs and traditions that have characterized Italian culture .
They will not only see one type of history but many because Italy , for many centuries , had an important function for exchanges and commerce .
That 's why Italy is such an interesting and historical country .
Dear Mathew ,
Hi !
How are you ?
Thank you for your letter !
It was so nice to hear from you again !
In your letter you asked me for advice .
So , I think that both hobbies has their advantages and disadvantages .
If I were you , I will give up with sport , because I think that music classes can help you to impress a girl .
But , on the other hand , sport helps you to keep your muscles in tonus .
But you know , decision is your and I can just somehow effect on it .
Sorry , I need to go and wash my raccoon , he is very dirty after a walk .
Hope to hear from toy soon .
Best wishes ,
Sasha
Many people feel that learning English especially in ' England ' or in ' The USA ' , is better than learning that in a country that does not have English as its mother tongue .
For instance , in Peru everybody speaks Spanish so you are not accustomed to the language .
The advantages of learning English abroad are the everyday practice , which you should have if you are in an English country and all the people who you get to know from all the world .
One argument in favour of this idea is that Peruvian people who learn English for a short period and then travel abroad , have an enhancement in just one or two months .
However , the disadvantages are that you do not know how to behave in another culture .
And it is difficult to change your everyday routine .
Also , you can suffer from jet - lagged if you travel a long distance .
In conclusion , I am of the opinion that people ought to study abroad if they have the opportunity , so apart from your lessons you can interact with native people and learn usually - common phrases .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .
She knew that her eighteen birthday approach and she will spend them and all the preceding week with her friends in Spain .
They had to fly next Monday and go back next Sunday .
Her birthday was in Friday and they all wanted to go that night to the greatest club in Barcelona to have some fun .
Other girls left out earlier because they prepared something special for her .
But before she went to the club , she was invited for one drink with lifesaver from the hotel 's pool .
Then the people from the hotel saw her last time .
She did not appear in the club , and she did not come to the hotel on consecutive days .
Her friends came back to their country but Anna still is missing .
Her parents and her sister still looking for her .
If you want to meet somebody strange , do not leave your friends or family without knowledge with who and where you want to go .
It 's only for your safety .
People travel less in public vehicles these days .
Many thinks that life of public transport is going to end .
I believe that it is true because the people are more concerned about their privacy and time taken to travel by the public transport .
In this essay these worries are studied carefully .
Private vehicle offers more privacy than public vehicle .
A breast feeding woman can feed her baby in the car without worrying about her privacy .
For example , If she is sitting on a bus , she could n't feed her child because people sit in the nearby seats they may gaze at her .
On a hot day the lady ca n't remove her coat to reduce body heat .
For example , A lady travel on a bus and if she removes her coat everybody will look at her and probably tease her but in her car she can do what ever she want .
Hence , the private vehicles give enough privacy and comfort for a family .
The public transport may take more time to travel and have rigid schedule than private vehicles .
A car can be drove very fast in order to reduce the time taken to travel .
In case a person who is going for an interview for a job , punctuality is a must , hence he can drive his car fast or can go earlier in his car to reach there early .
But he could not travel on a bus very fast in order to reach destination very quickly .
Because public transport have a fixed timetable .
Hence public vehicles take more time to travel .
In conclusion , usage of public transportation is reducing day by day .
People are getting anxious about their privacy and the trip time .
In order to boost the usage of public transport the government or the governing body should consider these factors and must find a solution to these problems .
We almost forget about those days before the Internet arrived .
The technology has changed us much faster and more dramatic than we used to think .
We had to carry a map for our adventure 10 years ago .
Nowadays all of what we need is a full charged smart phone with the Google Map application .
In the past people could only have a purchase from store to store by themselves , now we can browse almost hundreds of goods on line and buy it through a simple click .
For this tremendous outcome I believe that our lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years , with greater extension to every aspect of our lives .
In my imagination , the future would be more messy and crowded with less species of creature but more of us , the human beings .
We will face the more serious problems of global warming and other awful environmental pollution .
Some of the countries will be submerged entirely into the sea , some will survive , and less space for increasing people .
Fortunately the most outstanding scientists will solve the energy crisis and will find ways to create new lands for living , to clean air for breathing , and to purify water and food for supply .
Other than the situation I mentioned above , we will have our memories and knowledge being replicate in the form of digital data .
We can access all the knowledge from the Internet as we need .
When we have a dementia ( a steady degeneration disease of our brains ) we can take back our lost memories from the backup system of on - line " Big Cloud " memories .
No longer do we suffer from studying foreign languages as our eyes are capable of translating to the language we known though the linkage to the huge database online .
Also , we can change our emotions by releasing some invisible chemicals which can trigger off reactions in our brains .
We can experience the most extraordinary dreams without harmful effects to our personalities .
Moreover , our clothing will be able to change colours and patterns even the physical functions corresponding to the changing environments or simply by our specific commands .
However , the more we feel convenient , the more damages to our intellect .
We do n't have to think too much about almost everything , needing no person to company with since we have all these distractive devices for joy and relaxation .
The distance between people will increase dramatically until we finally wake up from all of these unrealistic convenience we have .
It sounds like a scary science fiction , but it may happen if we keep pursuing only values of materials .
What thing the most important is to set a right direction for the future of us .
We have a lot of problems waiting to be solved .
For example , saving the endanger wildlife and the scarce fish in the sea is much more important than those inventions which only make our lives more convenient .
Time - saving and convenience are admittedly considered two essential values of modern lives .
Nonetheless , we have to confront the truth that the resources from all over the world are distributed unfairly .
The top 50 riches in the world hold most of the power to control the direction of our future .
PLANE , TRAIN OR BOAT ?
Currently there are many means to transport , but if we talk about long distances , remain the most popular trains , planes and boats .
Which of these is better ?
We may think that depends on how you like to travel , as they all have their advantages and disadvantages .
When you travel by land , train is one of the best options .
however you ca n't travel by train when you want to cross the sea .
But personally , my favorite way to travel is by plane .
It is faster than the two , it is no difficult to travel on it and it is quite comfortable .
Also you can travel to different places and longer distances while boating , for example , you can only travel to places where connection to the sea .
In short , plane is one of the best options to do it .
Dear Jo ,
I 'm really glad to know about your future plans , I definitley think that this year of travelling and discoverying will be a great way to grow up , meet new people of different cultures .
If I have the opportunity to help you in your organization , please no doubt that I will certainly do so .
Firstly I strongly recommend you to visit the main capital , which is full of marvellous historical and cultural sites such as museums , art galleries , monuments and churches .
Whether at some point you are fed up with art and culture , the city offers to you a lot of leisure time facilities such as concerts , exhibitions , festivals and so on !
From the main capital you can easily travel by train or plane and reach in a few hours all the major cities both in the North and in the South of the country .
As you arrive during the summer , you should then have a vacation in the South where the beaches are breathtaking , with such a clean water and golden long shores .
In connection with your desire to find a job , you should try to find a temporary job in the tourism field : as you wrote , you 're searching for a monthly job and I reckon that a seasonal job for the summer would perfectly fit your expectations .
By the way , a friend of mine runs an hotel in a seaside resort and I know that he was looking forward to an English native speaker who could help him with his foreign guests .
If you are interested , I could give you his phone number and e - mail so that you two are able to speak about the matter and maybe find an agreement .
My statement to apply to a university
My name is Najla Bitar . I am from Iraq .
I graduate from AL - mustansiria University / collage of Arts / department of Translation in 1998 .
I started my work for the Ministry of Oil as senior translator in 2000 .
My country 's history inspired me all my life , the important role that my city ( Baghdad ) played in the history of education and translation specially affects the history of civilization of humanity .
Which inspire me to study Translation that considers science and art in the same time .
I pursued my life dream of higher education by searching the best universities in UK .
I found your Translation and Interpretation program for master degree meets my requirements and needs .
Since my graduation I acquired wide experience in translation .
After my graduation .
I spent two years in translation hundreds of assays in different fields for higher education students .
In 2000 .
I work in the OIL MINSIRTY 's central library on foreign scientific books which concerned mainly in petroleum filed .
This gives me wide knowledge in petroleum jargons that open endless horizons of experience and how to work on developing my knowledge and skills .
My enriched experience in English language and my knowledge in petroleum expression qualified me to work in Training and Developing Directorate mainly in abroad training .
I did many important translations for training manuals and petroleum institutions student description .
As well as , the higher administration in Training & Developing directorate selected me to join focal committee to buildup competency system for petroleum staff in corporation with the British government .
I attended many training courses in different fields like computer , human resources , English language that held in Baghdad , British council in Amman and last one was in London at luminous language solution .
I did IELTS exam twice and scored ( 5.5 ) .
In spite of that I did not give up .
I intend to study in your university in the pre session courses to meet your standard in English language .
All the above mention crystallized my ambition in continuing higher education in a respected university .
I intend to specialize in translation that concerned with the petroleum sector .
It goes without saying that I am form petroleum country and I intend to work in OPEC as representative of my country and enhance the Ministry of Oil translation staff with highly educated translators .
I plan to give hand the freshman translators in the Ministry to precede their career under my supervision by couching and mentoring them .
I am sure that you will give me hand in realizing me dream by giving me the right direction to make my dream come true .
At first you should visit sights like a churches and a cathedrals then move to the town centre and go through the town park .
There you will find beautiful countryside and gorgeous swans , which stay there for the whole year .
I can recommend you to visit the library .
It 's quite architecturally significant building I think , plus there is about million books , so you can learn something new about our culture .
There are also good pubs and restaurants .
There is a pub called Richard 's . You can easily find it because it 's huge green building just next to the library .
There you can taste our national cuisine bud also their international cuisine is tasty .
Just do not order the pancakes , because they do really bad pancaces .
If I were you I would ordered the shots of alcohol because there is a toy train which will deliver the shots to you .
You can also go to the club .
There are some clubs in the town : the A 's and the Subway , which are in the centre , and the Barrel , which is on the outskirts of the town .
I go to the A 's quite often , about once per month , but I have never been in the Barrel so I ca n't tell you , what it is like .
So if you will go to the A 's you will find it by the lights .
In front of the building are enormous reflectors which shines into the darkness .
Not far from the town lies zoo .
You definitely have to visit it .
There are about thousand of animals and in the midlle of it is located a gorgeous castle .
Charles Dickens and Emily Bronte are both Victorian writers .
Their novels have much in common : first of all the plot is usually pretty complex ( as we can see in David Copperfield by Dickens and Wuthering Heighs by E. Bronte ) , and so are the characters , which are always well described especially on a psychological level ; furthermore both the authors included in their works the figure of the noble who helps the hopeless child who comes from a lower class .
There is also a lot in contrast , most evident is the difference between the settings : Dickens prefers industrial cities while Emily prefers rural villages , and these choices reflect different topics , in fact Charles mostly deals with themes like exploited childhood , the miserable conditions of lower classes and the bad consequences of the industrialisation , instead Emily Bronte is more concerned about the theme of respectability , even if her female heroins do not reflect Victorian values such as chastity and prude .
Then we can notice that the narrator of the novel has different roles : Dickens 's narrator is omniscient , Emily 's one is part of the story itself and can change revealing characters ' perspectives .
We feel happier during the conversation when someone who has a good sense of humor .
Some people agree with that a good sense of humor is not one of the most important human qualities .
However , others disagree with it .
This is because people who have a good sense of humor can bring joy for others .
Also , people could have a good relationship when they have a good sense of humor .
Moreover , people can use their humor to overcome some difficult issues .
I would like to provide examples to illustrate my thesis .
First , people who have a good sense of humor can make others to laugh .
Moreover , we can feel happy easily .
For example , my friend , Jane , talks lots of jokes to let us laugh out loud .
We like to talk to her because she always can bring happiness to us .
Also , we can forget lots of annoying things from our work .
Consequently , we feel happy so easily because my friend has a good sense of humor .
Second , people can make a friend easier when they have a good sense of humor .
For instance , my mother always has lots of new ideas , and she likes to tell people in a funny way .
Also , after people talked to her , they always wanted to talk to my mother again and are eager to be her friends .
In this case , people who have humor can make a friend easily .
Third , sometimes a person who has humor can help others to overcome some difficult issues .
To illustrate , my niece did not get a great score in his test .
His mother told him that he did a great job because he studied so hard .
Also , his mother told him he would do better next time .
My niece had courage after his mother talked to him .
Later on , he got a great score in his test .
To sum up , people who have a good sense of humor can bring happiness to people .
Also , people can have a good relationship with their humor .
Furthermore , sometime people with a sense of humor can help others to conquer the difficult issues .
In the trend of globalization today , the success or failure of the business depends on many various factors .
Perfect product , good manager , and great marketing are the three key elements to success in business .
First of all , the products are manufactured must perfect meet the requirements of customers .
Company need to create a new product variety of designs , styles , types , sizes and colors , but still ensure high quality .
Besides , good products with reasonable prices will always attract the attention of customers .
The price of each kind of product must suitable with consumers that the enterprise directed to .
For example , workers with an average income would not choose to buy luxury goods for the rich or for those with high incomes .
Second , the management of business leaders plays an important role in the success of the company 's business .
The head of the enterprise must have the knowledge and experience to make the right and reasonable decisions .
The leader of the business must also have a way to handle the active and innovative work to save time and money .
Himselves of leader must have discipline , know working on time , and know how to create group working consensus , seriously .
Finally , great marketing is a necessary measure in order to succeed in business .
Marketing 's job to deliver content to customers learn more about company and the products and services in order to increase the advantage in the consumption of goods and increase profits .
Companies can create a site dedicated itself to introducing the value of the products , prices and services deals .
In addition , enterprise may be marketing through advertising , newspapers ... it is important to listen to feedback from customers to understand and supply what they need .
Business is not easy work and success in business is very difficult .
Good products with reasonable prices , a good manager of the strong leadership and excellent marketing plan are the factors that lead to success in business
Importance of outdoor games
As we know every person wants to get success in their respective lives .
For this they must possess a healthy life .
Outdoor games are made only for this purpose that is to make a person healthier .
In ancient times every child loved to play games outside their homes and they were more stronger than children in today 's world .
There are many games that children can play like : cricket , badminton , football etc .
Our world 's great scientist have invented internet to solve various distant problems .
Students start forgetting their physical games and got stuck in this internet world .They are giving so much time in using internet and they do only baseless gossips on social networking websites .
If they want to use it they should try to focus on getting important information which is benefial in improving their knowledge skills .
Using internet in wrong manner may affect their studies and health as well .
By playing physical games they will not only improve their health but can also gain concentration .
They should try to understand the importance of physical games and also play it regularly .

Dear Jo ,
I am so glad that you would like to come to my country .
My
country , Indonesia , is full of natural attraction .
It is an archipelago , surely many spots of tourism here .
Beach , island , culture , and culinary are the common interest to explore here .
If you would like to see wonderful beach , you could come to Bali , Lombok , Sulawesi or Irian Jaya island .
If I can say , beaches in those islands are more beautiful and natural than in Java island .
You could travel by plane from Jakarta to Bali or by train from Jakarta to Surabaya , so you can take a plane from Surabaya to Bali .
If you choose to travel by plane from Jakarta to Bali , the trip will be much shorter , spending only two hours .
If you plan to enjoy your trip along fresh greeny landscape in Java island , you can travel by train .
It needs almost 15 hours , but you could have the view of villages during the trip .
Basically , I like to travel by train for enjoying the view along the railway track .
Also , you can interact longer with other passengers especially native Indonesian , just in case you need to explore more about Indonesia as you would like to get temporary job here .
Indonesian people are famous with their friendliness , so you could start a conversation with them to ask anything about Indonesia ; they will answer your questions with pleasure .
Here are few tips for starting conversation with Indonesian : Indonesian person will reply a smile with a smile , so you can start with it ; not all Indonesian speaks English , but most students could speak English .
I suggest you to choose college students , because they are more familiar with English , besides they will welcome you with pleasure to experience their English ability ; when you are going to use public transportation , you could ask an information you need to the official employee in the station or to student for the same reason , not many Indonesian speak English .
Bali is the most famous Indonesian island for foreign people , many of them even know Bali but not Indonesia .
Lombok , Sumbawa , Sulawesi and Irian Jaya islands have very beautiful beaches as well .
The tourism service in Bali and Lombok is better than other islands mentioned above but other islands are more challenging and natural .
If you like hiking , you could explore mountains in Java : Semeru , Ranu Kumbolo , Bromo , etc .
Joining community of hiking student can be useful , because they will be pleasant free guide for you , this trick has more effective budget for your trip .
Another way , you could follow agency to get a guide , but it is not free , you have to manage cost for the service .
It can be little bit difficult to find temporal job here , unless you got any connections with agency or local people .
Teaching English is common job for foreign people , moreover foreigner teacher is more likely than local teacher .
May my advice can be useful for your trip in Indonesia .
It is true that the scale of current marriages is larger and more luxurious than that in the past .
There are some reasons for this situation .
Personally , I think this development has both positive and negative sides .
Thanks to increasing living standard , people are able to afford a bigger and expensive wedding .
If in the past , they just hold weddings at home to save money , now they tend to choose restaurants and hotels instead .
Secondly , it is likely that nowadays people focus more on appearance , so luxurious and elegant wedding is an occasion for them to show off .
It let people to know that they are important or powerful .
Finally , people have more relationships in life as well as in business .
Therefore , the number guests invited to the wedding are much more than that those in previous time .
A bigger wedding is required to meet this change .
Obviously , expensive and larger marriage have some benefits .
It is a special case to bring people together .
As a result , more new relationships are created , people get more chance to co - ordinate in business and help each other in life .
Those who losing contact for a long time can exchange current information and keep in touch again .
Furthermore , modern weddings bring to people new experiences about food , lifestyle and culture exchanging .
However , there are also some drawbacks it bring about .
These such big and expensive marriages waste a lot of money and time to prepare .
Grooms , brides and their parents usually have to book restaurant , hotel , invite singer and famous master of ceremony to make the wedding serious .
Instead of that , this amount of money can help the couple buy house or car for a new life .
Last but not least , in some cases , only for the sake of showing off , many couples , after getting married , have to work hard to earn money to pay the debt for wedding expenditure .
To conclude , marriage is a landmark of individual .
However , a wedding with a reasonable scale will either satisfy the guests or reduce the burden for the couple and their families .
It was a trip I 'll never forget .
At first , when the ski lift rose up to the station , I was terrified as I was suspended from the ground .
Some days before we had decided to organize an excursion to a nature trail nearby as soon as we arrived at the railway stop , we were so fascinated by what surrounded us that we had been walking for three hours along a path , Suddenly , our surroundings appeared to be far wilder than it had been before so we stopped trekking and we had a look at our map .
Only then did we realize we had lost our way , we had not been paying attention to our path , the only thing we could do was to go back .
As we were going back to the ski lift , we heard a strange noise which was coming from the bushes behind us .
We turned towards the bushes immediately , we were worried as we had listened to the radio that a bear could have lived there .
Fortunately , it was a beautiful deer as Bamby which looked at us and ran away more frightened than us .
Eventually , it was a special trip !
Dear to whom it may concern ,
I am writing to apply for a job in a summer camp in the USA .
I am interested in the job because this would be an opportunity of spending my summer in a more fun way .
Another thing is that : I would improve my skills in working with children and I find the money useful to expand my academic qualifications .
Firstly , I am a young college student , a friendly person and devoted to my studies . I enjoy cooking as one of my hobbies .
I also take pleasure in playing tennis , for the benefits of practising sports and staying active .
Besides , I particularly enjoy outdoor activities rather than indoor ones .
I believe this job would suit me for the following reasons : I am familiarized with the environment in summer camps as I spent my previous summer in one .
Another reason is that I have gained experience taking care of children from working as a babysitter recently .
Furthermore , I have a great sense of leadership as well as the social skills needed from being a scout for five years .
All in all I can assure you that I would be a great addition to your team of workers for all the reasons above stated .
For that , I hope my letter is taken into consideration .
I patiently await an answer .
With kind regards , Catarina
Last summer I spent in Oxford , UK studying English in language school for ESL learners .
I knew no one in the city ; my friends and family were far away , so I felt lonely .
I came to school with almost zero knowledge of English , and after entry tests , I was applied to level higher than mine .
When I went to class there was a group of students who had already studied together for some time .
Being happy together , they were not paying attention to a new girl .
There was not a chance to befriend with them , I thought .
Third school day gone , one of the classmates caught me in a hall and asked if I want to join them tonight for dinner .
I was needed practice in speaking so much , so it was what the doctor ordered !
There was the only problem : I can not communicate well in English and I was really shy about it .
But when the dinner started there was nothing to worry , because my classmates appeared supportive and patient .
This evening was so delightful !
I told them about my country and family , I was speaking English and they were understanding me !
It gave me a strong belief in future progress in learning .
The guy who invited me , Francois from France , spoke with me more than others .
Starting to spend every evening together , we spoke about past , expressed our thoughts and future plans .
Every time when I felt weak about my English he supported me like no one else .
He helped me forget about my fear , because his believing in my success made me stronger .
After two weeks he returned to France , but we keep in touch even today .
I am going to France this December , and Francois will show me independent Paris !
Hello Paul ,
Did you remember that I went to the Muse concert in Dublin last month ?
I 'm sure you remember because I spoke a lot about this event .
I was n't a simple spectator .
I was part of the team !
I was in charge of the tickets sale .
There were ten doors in the building and my job was to sell tickets at door number 5 .
I sold 567 tickets at the price of 55 € uros .
I could see the show from my place but the most exciting thing happened at the end of the show .
The artists invited all the staff to a big party in a restaurant .
It was unbelievable to speak with the artists and ask them questions about their life and habits .
Nowadays it 's common to think that travelling by car is much more conventient than travelling by public transport but it 's no true at all .
Some surveys have demonstrated that travelling by car is more expensive that travelling by public transport .
The increase in the fuel cost for example , will have surely a negative impact on the use of private vehicles .
Moreover other costs will act upon the prices of travelling by private vehicles .
In the same surveys , the researcher show how travelling by public transport is safer than travelling by car .
The annual average of crashes caused by public transport measures of 43% , instead of the private one that is around 76% .
As for the pullotion , it could be reduced if people use the public vehicles ; it is well - known that the CO2 emissions per passenger kilometre by public means of transportation are 80% less than a car .
Obviously the quality of public transport has to be improved .
Significant changes have to be done either to ensure the quality of service and the conditions of the coaches , trains and other public means of transportation .
In this way the customer can feel comfortable as they fell in theirown cars .
ESSAY : Young people in Spain are not as healthy as they should be
The latest research carried out by The Health Department in Spain show that young people are not as healthy as twenty years ago .
That could be a higher problem if the trend is maintained for a long time because public spending could raise 60 % in the next 10 years .
The reasons for that may lay in the current financial crisis that is strongly affecting over most middle classes in the country .
The low quality in products that young people eat and the little variety in eating habits could get things even worse .
Besides , too much use of computer and mobile phones is not helping to mend the problem at all .
Finally , it is proved that youths are devoting less time to do exercise than they should and as a consequence , they are not improving their general health enough .
As far as I am concerned , I think Spanish government should implement health programmes and advertisement campaigns in order to improve health in young population .
Furthermore , Spanish schools should pay more attention to this matter and teach children how to develop a healthy lifestyle .
Travelling by car is only convenient in a restricted sense while public transport is overall more convenient .
What is meant by a restricted sense is that for adults , who are healthy and able bodied , having access to personal transportation is arguably quite attractive .
They can simply travel when they choose and not be tied to a timetable that has been devised out of their control .
However note my emphasis on adult , healthy and able - bodied , for young people , for older people , for people with disabilities being able to drive brings more costs than benefits .
A public transport system is much more convenient for this group of people because they wo n't need to worry about the skill and attention needed for driving .
Furthermore the monetary costs in the long run are much better using public transport both for individuals and for the wider society .
I totally agree with this statement .
Famous people often are annoyed , because every their action will appear in the magazines or Internet .
They ca n't do trivial things such as shopping or going to the cinema with their family insensible for the fans and papparazi .
Even when celebrities are having holidays people ask them to give an autograph .
Sometimes famous people look a little bit different that on the stage and their faces wihout any makeup appear in the Internet .

Hello James!I had already read your email and I 'm going to try to give you some advice . I know you love doing sports , in special golf , and it helps you a lot to be in shape , but , do you really have to do it ?
Is necessary for your health but , what about if you go running in the mornings ?
You keep doing sport but in another time .
On the other hand , I know that music is your passion , and in my opinion , you should n't give up music classes , when you 're stress it helps you to relaxes you .
Also you 're about to finish your classes , so if you give up music , you will discard all your effort .
Anyways , if you feel that going to your music classes is stressful and you do n't have time to do it , try a new sport ! maybe soccer , or go running in the mornings as I said before , believe me golf is kinda funny but you do n't exercise too much as you could .
I hope this letter help you to decide whatyou will do .
See you soon !

The complexity of human behaviour is critical in Sport .
As a result of this many studies have shown that athletes shuold be motivate to push themselves above the record .
You need a motivation to believe in your self that you can achieve it .
This attitude is especially true to Sportsman and women .
Swimming includes all these abilities .
One of the most difficult sport on the Earth will learn you what it means hard work , sacrifice , pain , strain but also satisfaction , determination , pride and struggle .
The complexities in swimming are not only for the body work out but above all for the mind .
If you want to swim evryday pushing yourself above your limits , you definitely need a strong psyche and a solid motivation .
People that would to start this sport , they should know that this is not just a sport .
This is life .
You certainly will learn to fail and win but the most important thing that you will lern is never give up .
Futhermore like Michael Phelps said : " There will be obstacles , there will be doubters , there will be mistakes but with hard work ... there are no limits " .
People have had a need in communication since the dawn of time .
Every human being has a need in socialising and that is the first reason why I believe we start making friends .
Personally I usually get on with people pretty well and make new friends easily as I am a natural extrovert ( or so I think ) .
It usually starts with small talks or compliments , as at school I was taught that expressing appritiation to people can be a good start of any kind of relationships .
A true friendship itself forms on a base of strong mutual understanding and this takes a good deal of time .
Friends do not have to share the same opinion on every topic , however , they should respect and support each other even if they disagree .
All in all , even despite the fact that making friends can be a struggle ( they need our time and efforts ) , they give us support and love and improve our mood when we need it most .
I was walking in the center of Turin when I saw a big , beautiful hotel , with a lot of police who were trying to maintain law and order because there were a lot of people like me that wanted to know what was going on .
I saw a policeman who was my friend and he explained to me that a man had been killed by someone and he allowed me to go into the room and see the scene of the crime .
I went to see the room of this poor man , called Mr Smith .
All the room was in order and the policeman explained to me that the man , who had been very old , had also been rich .
Mr Smith was found on the floor with next to him a glass , which was completely broken .
I thought that he must have called the reception for some wine , as the waitress said that every night after he had eaten , he always drank a glass of wine .
All night the body had lain like this on the floor .
The next day the waitress knocked once , twice , three times but no one answered , so she thought that the man might have gone out .
She opened the room with some keys that all the waitresses have , and saw Mr Smith lying dead on the floor .
The detectives analysed what was in the glass and it was poison .
I think that someone who wanted to inherit Mr Smith 's money must have killed him for this reason .
In fact I discovered that Mr Smith 's nephew wanted all his fortune .
So he must have killed him with the poison .
Sometimes people will do anything for some money
Nowadays it 's believed that it 's better to work on your own than to work as a group .
First I completely agree with this but then when I started to think about it I realized that it 's not like that .
Firstly I think that if you work as a team you can help each other and if you have more people to talk about any situation you could have a better and more completely answer because you have the ideas and the knowledge of every single member of the group .
Secondly I think that the members of the team give you support , love and company .
Sometimes the members of a group began to be so close to you that you love them the same as if they were part of your family .
Moreover if it is a really nice group it is funnier to work with them than to work alone .
In conclusion , I believe that it 's better to work as a team than to work on your own because they give you love , company and you could pass a very good time
It is well known that an image is better than a thousand words and that may be the reason for the success of television in a recent survey as the most important invention of the last 100 years .
However , this election could not be the wisest as there are other inventions more useful than television and with better future applications .
I am referring to the Internet . Born in the 1970 's as a military project to interconnect the missile facilities and the central headquarters , it soon spread to universities and educational centers .
This fact , along with the spreading of personal computers , quickly became in a generalization of its use in the first decade of the XXI century .
Nobody wants to dismiss the importance of television and its achievements .
For more than 50 years it has been the main entertainment channel displacing others as radio , theater , cinema and , sadly , also books .
In its first years television was also an important channel to culture ( theater plays , classic films , etc . ) .
Unfortunately , in the last years television has lost this educational focus .
The Internet , on the other side , has became more and more popular not only for entertainment but also for business and today is almost impossible to find an activity in which the Internet does n't play a major role .
The Internet has also replaced television to watch films and TV shows , especially among young people who prefer to download and watch the videos instead of watching on the fixed schedule of TV .
A fire in the French Alps
This experience is unbelievable and unforgettable to me .
It was in winter 2002 when 2 friends and me were working in a hotel in a village called Tignes .
The hotel had 8 floors and the workers lived on the top floor .
At about 8 p.m in the evening on December 12th , my friends and me went back home .
It was the end of a hard work 's day so we went to bed early ; we were very tired and we had forgotten to put out a candle .
Then , disaster struck .
One hour later our table was on fire .
While the fire was spreading all over the bedroom , I woke up and Matxi was unconscious because there was a lot of smoke in the bedroom .
Monica and me called out her name and we slapped her face .
Fortunately , we managed to wake her up .
At the moment , some friends and other workers who lived on the same floor go into the bedroom .
At the beginning , we could n't stop the fire , and although this night sound impossible , we managed to put out the fire .
That day I was afraid , but now I remember this experience as a good time .
Public transport has been discussed enough but there is always space for further discussion .
Now the question uder discussion is whether public transport has future as travelling by car is gaining more and more popularity because of its advantages .
Well , I think it has future .
First , there are always lots of people who would prefer not to give much thought where to park their car or how to avoid traffic jams .
The metro , which is a means of public transport , solves all these problems .
In smaller towns without underground there are usually a number of bus routs to cover the city area , so , all you need is to go to a bus stop and to get on a bus and soon you 'll reach the destination .
One should n't forget that using public transport helps to save money .
It 's not a secret that gas , insurance and reparings are costly .
Safity issue is very important also .
It is obvious that is safer for the environment than thirthy cars with an only person inside .
You should take into account that thirty drivers(often inexperienced or aggressive ) pose a greater danger to road users than than one trained bus driver who feels responsibility for his passengers and for other participants of the traffic .
The answer is evident , I think .
And the last but not the least thing is that there are quite a lot of people who are not able or just do n't want to drive , so the only way out for them is public transport .
Moreover , cities ' authorities encourage development of public transport because it creates employment , lessens impact on the environment and contributes to road safity .
So , my opinion is that public transport does have the future . Travelling by car is convenient but public transport has undeniable benefits for long lasting life as well .
It was a beautiful Sunday morning and Michael was preparing to go out to meet his old friend Peter .
He was running to the cafe where they were supposed to meet .
Peter was already there and he immediately told Michael about a trip to Italy that he had planned for them .
Everything sounded great , they only needed a little bit more money and a car .
Michael taught that he could use his father 's car , and borrow some money from his mother .
He knew that Peter was a little bit irisponcibile , but he taught that the arragement sounded perfect and nothing could go wrong .
He managed to get the money and take the car from his dad and went to pick up Peter .
He got to Peter 's apartment to help him with his luggage .
He was thinking that this time it would be different , everything was planned and they will have a great time .
He opened the door and saw that Peter was n't packed at all , he had changed his mind about the trip .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Alison read the note , smiled and immediately put on her coat .
She 's gotten used to receiving those short messages every day .
Someone would write something short and simple like " Keep smiling " or " You 're beautiful " and leave the note on the mirror right behind the front door .
No name of the author on it , but let 's face it - there was only one guy on Brooklyn who would wake up every day before the dawn , no matter if it was raining or snowing , and run like crazy to Alison 's family small flat .
Just to make her smile every single morning as if something amazing had happened to her .
Occasionally her older sister would watch her down from the hall and poke her index finger on her forehead . " What a jerk " she 'd mutter under her breath .
But truth was that she was jealous .
Very , very jealous .
Thomas was one of those guys that every gal had wished to be around with .
He was handsome as hell , well - build and a true gentleman .
He worked hard at the docks to make a good living with his mother .
She lost her job when war started , as well as her husband - Tom 's father .
Back then it was pretty obvious that regardless his young age of seventeen , he would quit school and start earning money .
Because it 's just the way Tom is - stubborn and righteous .
Alison , well ...
Try to fit a heart and bravery of a lion into a small frame of sixteen - year - old girl .
She was weak , but preferred to be called fragile , as if that made a significant difference .
Her major health problem was asthma , as well as anemia , low immune system and underweight .
Credits to the last one , she 's skin and bones with almost no muscles .
All her clothes are from kids section and yet they 're usually too loose .
But there 's something in her big bright eyes , circled with long brown eyelashes and frecles , that makes her appearance unique and causes Tom 's heart to flutter every time he brings to his mind her piercing stare .
Alison 's sister , on the other hand , is a total opposite .
Mary is a picture of health with all her curves and pretty face .
Small snub nose , full lips and high cheekbones .
No freckles as her skin is perfect at every inch .
The only thing they have in common are eyes , taken from their mother .
Rest is anything but completely different .
That 's why Mary is constantly surrounded with a bunch of fellas meanwhile Tom is the only one to follow Alison and have her back .
And hell , she needs at least one to do it .
FILM REVIEW
ROMEO AND JULIET , Franco Zeffirelli ( 1968 )
The best known love story of all time - Romeo and Juliet - has been adapted a number of times for the cinema and also made into successful musicals .
One of the most renowned romance films based on the Shakespearean play was directed by Franco Zeffirelli in 1968 .
This flick stands out from low quality versions because of its accurate details .
The script is a faithful translation of the original text and the plot , as well , sticks to Shakespeare 's work .
This remarkable story is set in Verona in the 15th century .
The film , instead , was shot in central Italy and surprisingly the scene of the balcony hasn't even been filmed in Verona .
It 's about the tragic fate of two young lovers whose families are bitter enemies .
Romeo and Juliet fall in love and secretly get married .
The young bridegroom then is involved in a brawl and banished from the village .
The play becomes tremendously thrilling until the couple 's death .
The acting of a classic is undoubtedly a difficult task , and yet Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting play their role very convincingly .
Believable costumes and location , unforgettable soundtrack and outstanding performances celebrate a gripping and moving story that will charm you .
If you fancy travelling back in time , do n't miss this piece of art .
It 's worth it !

Re : Report about Active Leisure Club
The aim of this report is to make suggestions about the facilities of the club .
The swimming pool is big enough and the temperature of the water is fine .
However the water is dirty and it is recommended to clean the pool at least twice a week .
The gym is nice and comfortable , but newer machines should be bought to replace some of the machines that are actually in use .
The new tennis court was found very useful because most members of the club claimed that they liked playing tennis .
Also the court is cheap and the changing room is nice and clean .
On the other hand the opening hours are not enough and they should be extended .
The gym reception is nice , but the walls are painted with dark colours .
Is advisable to paint the walls with a brighter colour .
Apart from the above mentioned points , there maybe so many other ideas which can make a big difference to the club .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .
She did n't know exactly why , but she had the feeling .
The feeling it would be the last day of her journey .
She began to reminisce about the start of her journey .
Back then when she had been a little kid , she had dreamed of seeing the entire world .
In order to realize her dream , she had begun her journey .
It had n't been easy , she had had to leave her beloved homeland behind .
Just after saying farewell to her homeland , she had met an old woman .
The woman had smiled to Alice and had given her some words of advice , " Young girl you lose something important to you .
But do n't worry , as long as you 're willing to regain it , no matter what it takes , you will find it again " .
Alice had looked on confusion as the woman had been walking away .
Many years had passed .
Alice had gone through the entire world , from the hottest desert to the highest mountain .
Alice had decided to return to her homeland .
However , when she had arrived there had n't been anything but a barren desert .
She had been shocked .
Her family and her homeland had disappeared .
Sadness stroked her heart .
But , just as hope almost disappeared , she had remembered the words of the old lady .
And so , she had looked around to find a way .
Then she had found a gate nearby .
As unbelievable as it seems , it had been a gate of time .
It had been told that anyone who stepped through it would be cursed , but Alice 's willingness had been stronger than her fears .
She , without any hesitation , had gone through the gate .
Finally , after much time travels , Alice had this feeling .
The feeling of the end of her great journey through time .
She went for her last journey .
The first thing she saw was a young girl .
She looked at her and was instantly reminded .
That girl , indeed was Alice herself in her youth .
More specifically , it was Alice when she was starting her journey .
She instantly knew that her homeland must be nearby .
She then said the same words as the old lady she had met long ago .
And finally , she went on to her destination , her beloved homeland .
Has you told me that I will win some literary competitions and that some people will speak well of me , I would n't have believe you .
The year was 2012 and I had n't written anything until that day - I just had been translating some stories and once even subtitles for a Korean movie from English and Spanish .
But that day - it was on spring and I believe it was Thursday - my English teacher told us about a literary competition .
The theme was ' I visited the Earth in2112 ' .
It sounded like a quite good challenge for me so after finishing the then lessons I quickly sat down and started writing .
And when I wrote down the last sentence I immediately sent it to the stated email .
Only then I realised that there is nothing more to do , that I have to just wait .
First days I was a little bit nervous but day by day I started forgetting about any competition .
But a month ago my mobile phone started to ring .
An unknown number .
I picked up and heard nice woman voice .
And that voice told me that I am a winner of a third place !
So happy was I !
That moment a bit changed my life because I 've started to write more and more stories .
And the more won competitions , the more proud was I of myself .
Since I was a child , I had been curious to know how stuff works .
Disassembling games , building things of wood and playing Lego were my favorite hobbies .
Through the years , my interest in machines and electrical devices increased , so whenever a device stops working I tries to fix it before calling the maintenance , and my parents always encouraged me even when I broke it down .
When I was in secondary school , and my friends were dreaming of be Doctors or Dentists , I decided that I will be an electrical engineer or mechanical engineer , so I entered the scientific branch .
During my study , my parents and I noticed that I understand kinetic physics more than electrical physics .
Also , I was good at mathematics subjects that related to solid geometry , that is why I decided to study mechanical engineering .
Since I enrolled in the faculty of mechanical engineering , I had a goal to complete my master study in Europe or America .
After searching and asking , I found Germany has numerous prestigious technical universities , and it offers great study atmosphere for foreign students and supports them in many ways .
Moreover , Germany is one of the biggest industrial countries in the world and it has many huge factories .
Additionally , the living costs are quite affordable .
For those reasons , I am convinced that Germany is the best country to complete my study abroad .
I have been working as a teacher of mechanical materials in a vocational school since my graduation .
I really like this profession and how good it feels to spread science and knowledge to new generations .
Therefore , I have decided that I am going to continue my postgraduate study and pursue a Ph.D. degree to work as a teacher at a university .
I have been looking for a while for suitable university to apply to .
I read about TU - Clausthal and I decided to apply to it for many reasons .
First , I like the curriculum of the mechanical engineering master program .
Second , TU - Clausthal has very good rating in engineering at many websites like ranking.zeit.de .
Third , TU - Clausthal gives conditional admission and it has a language center .
Finally , TU - Clausthal located in fascinating nature .
I hope that I get the chance to complete my study at your university and to gain practical experience in one of the greatest industrial countries in the world .
A lot of different languages are spoken in all over the world , and it is not easy to choose one of them to learn it .
my view is that nowadays English is an important language that it is necessary for almost everyone , so I will choose to learn English first .
The most common reasons to study a language are the job and travelling .
Although in some places people do n't speak English , you always can find somebody who does .
In addition , English is not too difficult to learn .
Even though you have to study vocabulary and expressions , the grammar is easy to understand and you can be able to do simple sentences in a few days .
One of the subjects at school is English .
Therefore , we have to study it , and when we finish school we usually continue improving our English before learning another one .
All things considered , I think that English is the easiest option when you want to study a language .
Whereas there are a lot of options , we rarely start learning other language before we can communicate well in English .
Digital advertising ; an exciting but undesirable business
It is indisputable that advertising has become a permanent fixture in our daily lives .
Once a curious novelty that was largely considered a harmless addition to our sometimes dull and overly familiar environment , it was welcomed as fun and informative .
It was also - if one wished to do so - relatively easy to ignore .
But we have now entered a new era of the attention - grabbing business : its digitalisation .
Their transformation from innocent posters to digital screens ranging in size from miniscule to vast has made adverts all - pervasive .
Researchers say that an average adult in the developed world is now exposed to hundreds of commercial messages every day .
Those involved in this lucrative business are in awe of the almost endless possibilities that recent technological advances offer them .
Multimedia , advertising and entertainment companies now work in synergy to target everyone from toddlers who can barely speak to pensioners confused with the speed of life in the new age , unsubtly playing on their needs and desires in order to turn them all into faithful consumers .
They have so successfully infiltrated their own product into our everyday existence that we no longer see it anymore as what it really is : a nuisance .
Creators of adverts have long given up on informing the consumers and instead opted for seducing them .
The result are insincere , misleading and often deceitful messages that our minds are saturated with .
Perhaps it is time to do an experiment and hit a pause button and reflect upon this subject matter .
Imagine a world without adverts , for a week at least .
Would it be bleak and boring and leave us at a loss as what to buy , or might it just turn out to be a long yearned for respite ?
Dear Chairman ,
I am writing with regard to the campaign that you are promoting in favour of an international sports competition that could be hosted in my town .
As a matter of fact Venice could be a very good candidate for hosting the marathon competition , which will last one day
Moreover Venice is one of the most beautiful cultural cities in Italy .
The marathonetscoming before or staying after the competition can take the advantage of visiting the city , which offers a great deal of facilities
There are two separate communication networks in the city , that of the waterways and that of the narrow streets .
Public water buses and private water taxis run 24 hours a day although less frequently at night .
The main centre can be reached very easily .
Despite the private service is very expensive it is efficient .
Four and five stars hotels are located in the main area , but smaller hotels and a youth hostel are also available to families .
Hotel receptions and travel agencies are always ready to help their guests with a wide range of information on the city 's entertainments , exhibitions and so on .
Sightseeing and excursions with private local guides are available on request .
In addition to this there is a significant lack of evening entertainments in the city such as theatres , cinemas and night - clubs .
On the contrary participants will find a wide range of restaurants , trattorias and bars with a good selection of menus suggesting local food .
Some of these restaurants can be quite expensive .
In conclusion I think there will be no obstacles and objections to host this sporting competition in my town which on the other hand is also a cultural event for many of the participants .
Yours faithfully
Hey Paul
I read your email yesterday but I had n't had the time to reply yet .
The concert I helped at was amazing !
I helped catering the staff and during the concert I was free to walk around wherever I wanted because they gave me a security badge .
I just had to make sure nobody was hungry or thirsty .
This also meant I was allowed to go backstage and take care of the bands .
I had asked if I had permission to stand in front of the stage during the main concert and the organisation agreed .
The support act was a rather unknown band but they were really good .
Did I tell you who the headliner was ?
I do n't think so ..
It was NICKELBACK !
Their setlist was extremely good .
They played all of their famous songs and added some new ones .
After the show I had the chance to meet the band members .
Chad Kroeger gave me their new CD and the entire band signed it for me .
The guys were really nice !
I had an amazing time , too bad you could n't be there .
Hope to see you soon .

Hello Jane !
Here is a picture from the last summer when we were in Halland on an island called Nidingen !
My name is Lorin and I am 13 years old . I live in Djursholm at Riddarvägen 42 , close to a field .
I was born on August 4 at the hospital in Danderyd .
In my family we are five people , my mom Malak , my dad Claes , my little sister Novalie and my little brother Edvard .
Novalie is 10 years old and Edvard is 6 years old .
In my spare time I like to be with friends and I do also play soccer , dance and ski .
I really like to do sports because I like to be outside .
I compete in skiing and I think it 's very funny . I often go skiing in Åre , Vemdalen and in Ramundberget .
Once every year I ski with my ski club ( Täby slalomklubb ) in Switzerland .
In Switzerland we have been to Saas fee and Zermatt .
In Zermatt you can see the mountain Matterhorn ( the mountain that you see on toblerone package ) .
It is a very cool mountain .
I do also ski with my family and that is the best .
I like slalom because it goes fast and I like snow .
In the summer holidays my family and I just to be at the vest seaside on a small island called Kålhuvudet .
That is one of our summerhouses I love to be there because when we are there we swim in the ocean and we fish crabs and just have a really fun .
You can of course see the ocean and it is very beautiful .
Something else I like to do is shopping .
My parents call me a shopaholic and I almost agree . I like it because it is fun to look at clothes and try them .
I read pretty much and my favourite book is Harry Potter .
I like fantasy and that book is fantastic .
If it was possible to go on Hogwarts I would do it .
Now you know what my favourite book is so you can almost guess what my favorite movie is … Of course Harry Potter .
But I do also like a movie called The game plan .
It is about an American football player who does n't know that he has a daughter and one day the daughter came to his apartment .
Then it is a fun and fantastic story that I do n't want to say because then it is not going to be fun to see the movie .
I do n't see movies only I look at some series to .
For example Pretty little liars and Modern Family .
Pretty little liars is a little bit scary but I like it .
Modern family is my favourite series .
I like it because it is very comic .
My favourite song is a song called Chandelier with an artist called Sia .
It is a girl called Jasmine Thompson and she sing cover songs and I think she is a really good singer .

Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake , because the door could n't be opened again .
He was trapped .
Michael was very anxious and he did n't know what to do anymore .
The room was really dark and Micheal could n't see anything .
Then suddenly Micheal felt something under his foot .
It was a hammer .
Micheal tried to hit the door with hammer , but it was useless because that door was made of steel .
Snugly Micheal heard steps coming towards to him .
Micheal was really scared and he closed his eyes .
He opened his eyes again when the steps were faded away .
Michael felt himself strangely , because he was n't feeling walls around him .
Micheal was stuck in nowhere .
Suddenly Micheal felt pain in his chest .
The pain became stronger and stronger .
He felt like he is about to die .
He started crying because there was nothing he could do about it .
At the moment Micheal wanted to die , he saw a light coming from beyond .
He started running towards the light .
The moment he reached the light everything changed .
He did n't feel anything .
He could fly around .
Micheal seemed to be really happy in this moment .
Micheal felt something shaking him .
He was really confused because he thought he was dead .
Suddenly Micheal opened his eyes and he realized it was just a weird dream .
Smiles and Sounds at Charity Fun Day
This year 's Charity Fun Day was brilliant and we raised lots of money .
It was amazing event !
Local people were invited and a talent competiton was held .
Several student bands played and a variety of food was available !
Everything started on Saturday afternoon on the main square in Krakow .
Number of people exceeded my expectations !
There were a lot of them .
The weather was fantastic : the sun was shining and birds were singing .
Generally , bands played great , but of course there were also terrible singers in the competition - but it did n't matter so much .
I 'll never forget the sounds and smiles of these happy people with their arms in the air who were standing under the stage .
As we know , this type of event ca n't take place without food .
On a Charity Fun Day the air was filled with the fabulous smells of Indian , Italian and many other world cuisine .
Unfortunately , not all of the food was tasty , so one of the thing I 'd suggest changing next year is to avoid the hot dogs .
Also I 'd recommend delicious homemade ice cream .
It was fantastic experience , especially for people for which it was intended .
If you 're looking for a really good day out , come to next year 's Charity Fun Day .
You wo n't be disappointed .
Dear Jane ,
I 'm so sorry that it took me so long to reply , but I had to move out of my parents ' house last week .
It 's breaking my heart to hear that you 're in so terrible situation .
It must be awful for you .
To be honest , I 've never understood why you enjoy boxing anyway .
It 's brutal and I 'm always worried about you .
You 're such a cute , little girl .
And this sport ... I 'm surprised you can still play piano after all those accidents you 've had .
And you know how much I love your music .
It 's calming , beautiful and somehow suits you .
So if I were you , I 'd go for music classes .
Having said that , I also must admit that I know how hardworking you can be .
So I believe , if you really want to pursue both , you can do it and I 'll support you no matter what .
I hope I helped you a bit .
Let me know what is your decision .
And tell me more about that guy you met last month !
You 've been suspiciously quiet about that recently .
Best wishes ,
Daria .
I discovered the English language when I was eight , and that amazed me so much that one year later I started to take a course .
English was also the key for my passion for technology , the more that I understood the language , the more I understood how to use computers and the internet .
About six months later , I joined a computer class for kids in the same location that I took the English classes and since then , my love for computers and the language just grew .
That is why I wish to work in the areas of Computer Sciences , and studying abroad would give me an extra motivation and open new doors to show and expand my full potential .
Besides being my personal favorite for its culture and language , the United States of America offers big opportunities in this area , for it 's great universities and educational system .
I am currently an intern on a scientific research program in a group called GALP - Logical Programming Teaching Group , that , with the local city hall of Araraquara , aims to transform the city into a national technology , research and software producing center , accomplishing this goal by teaching logical thinking and alghoritms to kids , diminishing future evasion in many exact sciences courses .
To bring back from this exchange technical knowledge in programming , as well as new methods of teaching , would be outstanding .
Although I write and speak English in an advanced proficiency level , this exchange would provide the fluency I need in academic grounds and interpersonal communication , as all of the most relevant papers , research and journals are written in English , I want to achieve this level to make it easier to write and produce good material for the scientific community , and to communicate better with all cultures .
In Brazil , there is a huge lack of professionals on the field of information technology in both academic and work market , travelling abroad , especially in the U.S. , would qualify me in both areas .
Although I prefer the academic field , working in a company related to software design and creation would be a marvellous way of gaining experience in the field .
I would be happy too , if by any chance I could apply to summer jobs or internships , as another way of gaining experience .
Working as an intern at an information technology company or as a teacher assistant would provide me with a good example of how the market work for both academic and work careers .
In conclusion , I want to study in the U.S. for it 's differentiated educational system , for the work and research opportunities that I might find , to know better a culture that amazes me for its capacity to innovate in all fields , to become fluent in a language that I love , to return to my country with more knowledge in areas that I would not find here , and , in long - term , become a better professional or teacher , with a good and solid background on computer sciences , information technology and finally , system analysis and development .
I am writing to inform you about the most beautiful places and interesting buildings in Vilnius .
There are many places to visit but the most beautiful is Traku castle .
It is very popular pace to visit among tourists .
I think that a group of overseas students must see it .
This castle is very old and it is surrounded by water .
The castle is very big and you will need some hours to visit it .
It is very beautiful and there are many interesting things to see in this castle .
If you want to visit it , order a guide who will tell you the history of the castle in English .
This castle consists of many buildings and even underground tunnels .
In the yard of the castle you will see some cannons and other guns .
Moreover , there are many souvenirs sellers so you could buy something .
I hope that you will visit Traku castle while staying in Vilnius .
Yours faithfully ,

" Installation art " is a new form of expression made of a mixture of media art works , used by contemporary artists to communicate something in a modern way , different from traditional arts .
Installations are usually placed in big spaces because they have an important structure with the main task of making people reflect on something important that the artist needs to communicate to the biggest number of people .
Personally , I have seen only one " installation art " .
It was situated into a stand in Parque Del Retiro , in Madrid .
It was built by two different elements .
The first , placed in a corner of the stand , was made by a pile of plastic bottles and plastic baskets .
The second , in the centre of the stand , was a column made of coloured plastic baskets , surrounded by plastic bottles .
The artist wanted to represent the difference between the ecological recycling of plastic compared to the common collection of trash .
Seeing it for the first time it was impossible to understand the meaning of the column or the pile .
Only after having read the explanation it was possible to appreciate the installation art , and to have the complete attention to its meaning and shape .
Despite their beauty , new form of arts are very complicated to understand , especially compared to classical arts .
An example could be the medieval art .
Seeing a Da Vinci 's portrait or a landscape painting , it is immediately possible to appreciate the beauty of colours or the accuracy of shapes and the expressions of the subjects painted .
At first sight those paintings evoke an emotion in the observer , and the name of the piece helps to have a complete knowledge of the masterpiece .
On the other hand , looking at an installation art it is harder to have a clear emotion at the first sight without knowing the meaning of it or something about the artist .
In conclusion I think that all forms of art are made for the same reason , to communicate something .
In every historic period , artists have represented their life and what they feel in different ways .
Classical art was more easy for us to understand because it has been studied at school and it is very famous , while modern arts are totally new and more complicated to understand because of their composition and their significance .
In my opinion the difference between installation arts and classical arts stands in the feeling that they can suscitate in the audience .
Dear Camp Director :
I would like to work at the summer camp this year .
My name is Melissa , I am 14 years old and I can speak English . I love summer camps because you learn so much in them and have wonderful experiences too .
Looking after children is one of my favorite things to do and many people tell me I am good at it .
I have experience in looking after children .
I am always willing to help in anything . I can be very creative when in comes to fun things .
I took cooking classes last year , so I can also work in the kitchens .
I think it is very important for children to have fun in the summer camps .
In the other hand , they should learn something new in the summer camp .
And they need someone to help them and guide them through it all .
Kindest regards , Melissa
Feel the wind !
Kitesurfing - this sport discipline is getting more and more popular not only in countries such as Australia , Turkey or Egypt , but also in other ones , just like Poland or Germany !
Everyone who has ever stood on a surfboard and tried to catch the wind with a kite knows how wonderful it is .
A feeling of being completely free , a joy of moving on a surface of water standing on a small board , an incredible speed - all of those things can easily make you happy .
When I tried kitesurfing by myself for the first time , I was a little bit scared . "
How difficult it is ! " - that was my very first thought while seeing some surfers on the Baltic sea in Poland .
But believe me - there 's nothing to worry about !
Despite the fact that it seems hard , kitesurfing is one of the easiest water sports !
If you just learn how to keep a control of your body standing on a surfboard and how to steer a kite , there 's nothing that seems hard any more .
My only advice is : go to the seaside , find a nice camp for surfers with a good instructor , and enjoy your moments of freedom !
Dear Paul ,
It was great to hear from you .
I 'm sorry I haven't written sooner , but a lot is going on in my life now .
Last month I helped at Adele 's concert at the Royal Albert Hall .
It was a dream come true .
She 's my favourite singer .
Although I was a cleaner , it was the best thing , that recently happened to me .
Before the concert I had to sweep up the whole hall .
During the concert I was responsible for supervision of sort - out in toiletes .
It was n't my dreamy job , but it really repayed .
After the concert I saw Adele and my friend took a picture of me with her !
Can you imagine that ?
She smiled to me !
I wish I could do it again .
By the way , I met there your exgirlfriend with her new boyfriend .
Of course , I told her , you 're dating Lisa now .
Apart from that , I 'm going to help at Coldplay 's concert in two months .
I hope , it wo n't be my last job at concert .
Anyway , I must go now .
I ca n't wait to hear from you .
Tell me everything about your new girlfriend .
Write soon .
Lots of love ,
Ala.
This past year was special for me , I graduated from High School and I took a gap - year .
It was a very confusing but probably the best year of my life and I will tell you why .
As I said earlier , I graduated from High School which was a huge relief .
It was aweful .
The students were mean and the teachers did n't like me at all .
So on the day the vacation started I was the happiest I 've ever been .
Thus came the question of what I was going to do next , but I was n't ready to make that descission back then so with agreement of my parents I decided to take a gap - year .
Which was the best thing that ever happened to me .
I was extremely nervous about a week before my departure .
I was going to spend the next 6 months in the United States which actually teriffied me .
As my departure came closer , I started to question myself more and more if this was a good idea and if I would have a good time all those things .
On the big day I must say that I kind of felt numb , I did n't know what to think and what to feel .
The journey to the United States was surprisingly good , I had some friends on the plan who were going to the same destination as me and I actually did n't miss my family that much .
The 6 months I send there were the best of my life , I was so happy and enjoyed myself every day .
I also got to know myself better and I have reached a descission of what I want to do next year , I am going to study at the university .
I hope that I will enjoy that as much as I enjoyed this past year , it was truly amazing .
So if you are ever even considering the fact of taking a gap - year , do n't doubt , just do it .
It is amazing !
When I got to the door , I realised suddenly that something was wrong . I anxiously turned and looked at the window .
It was slightly open .
I felt cold sweat on my back .
I was sure that I had n't left the window open .
So who had … ?
I was wondering that maybe it 's just my imagination .
I had been staying at home for five days , I was n't really willing to see other people .
Maybe I have gone mad ?
I stared blankly at the window , unable to move .
Eventually , I slowly opened the door and came out of my room .
I went to the kitchen and sit on the chair , nervously fiddling with my bracelet .
It suddenly broke apart , and all the beads dropped on the floor .
In that sinister silence , it seemed to be the loudest sound on the world .
All of sudden , my phone rang .
It was my best friend .
" Laura ?
Are you okay ?
We haven't talked for ages " , she said .
It was reassuring to hear a familiar voice .
I had been feeling so lonely for a long time .
Before I made it to tell something , I heard terrible scream and my friend just hung up .
I felt cold sweat again , just like five minutes ago when I 'd seen open window .
After a little while , I heard a hoarse voice coming from the room with the open window . "
Laura ?
Come here .
We havent't talked for ages " .
It was my best friend 's voice .
We at Madhura Nagar , understand the need of protecting the environment and hence are committed to what we do .
We limit the number of houses and the number of people living in those houses because more people would mean we have to clear vast expanses of land for housing which would mean a reduction in the number of trees and a deathblow to the natural balance .
We also see that people adhere to the norms when they build new houses and do n't encroach on any public lands .
We encourage people commuting to nearby places to walk or use a bicycle depending on the distance and those going to the same areas outside the town to join car pools .
We also have a biogas plant in our outskirts that takes care of the rubbish and sewage and the power generated is used for street - lights and meeting the power needs of the community office .
We distribute jute bags annually with our community logo on it so that people can use them instead of plastic bags .
Each year , we encourage school - going children to plant trees to teach them the importance of trees in safeguarding our environment so that they can grow up to be responsible towards the environment .
We encourage people who come up with any innovative thoughts about how we could further protect the environment .
Besides this , we often visit our neighbouring towns and educate them on the issues of global warming , the threat to ecological balance etc . , and guide them on how to protect our environment .
Dear MR . Smith
I would like to apply for the job as a security guard for the Openair Frauenfeld as advertised in your Facebook - post from the 18th of July .
My name is Michael Freeman and I 'm twenty - nine years old .
I 've been working as a security guard in a lot of places around the world .
I was in a position of a leader for a Katie Perry concert and I worked for Angela Merkel when François Hollande arrived in Berlin .
I was a paramedic in first place but then I wanted to change something in my life and combined my hobby , which is going to the gym , and became a security .
With these experiences I can safely escort people , which are knocked out or a bit ill and ca n't stand the concert anymore , out of a concert and help them .
I have a degree in English and I can speak German and Spanish fluently .
I haven't got a family so I am independent and able to work wherever I can .
I feel I have the right experiences and attitude to be a great member of the crew and I hope you will consider my application favorably .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
Michael Freeman
I like almost all kinds of sports .
The only exception is volleyball - I just ca n't play it , I even do n't know why .
But I love basketball and handball - especially the first one - every time when we are playing basketball at school during Physical Education , I 'm so happy about it and I do my best . I do n't know how to explain why I love this game so much .
Maybe it 's because in basketball , you have to run a lot and you have to be really fast , and my second favourite sport is running .
Anyway - if someone asked me for advice about basketball , I would say : do n't give up if you are n't the best player on the world . I 'm also not .
And truly , who cares ?
If you enjoy this sport , just do it and nothing else matters !
Being famous seems to be the best thing that can happen to us .
But no matter how fabulous it looks , it brings some consequences and even problems .
One of the biggest disadvantages of being popular is that they are on everybody 's lips .
Public loves to know everything about their idols and they always try to find out some spicy details .
Everyone deserves privacy , but public figures should be aware of the fact that the society wants to know about them as much as it 's possible .
Whether they like it or not , they should be prepared for photographers and journalists trying to chase them in every single moment of their life .
It might be hard , but they need to be patient and try not to care about the people who interferes with their personal being .
In my opinion , journalists and paparazzi should n't stalk celebrities on their private holiday or try to get into their intimate life .
There are some borders that should n't be crossed .
For example , when a popular film star goes to hospital because of his relative 's illness , reporters and photographers in particular should stay away and leave the celebrity alone .
Even though they are well known , they have a right to have a free time and they should be albe to use it however they want to without anyone disturbing them .
It 's really important for people to know the bound between curiosity and nosiness .
We should respect other 's right to privacy and let them live their own lives .
Nature is one of the most important theme in the Romantic Age , since it is a reality that inspired many writers , both novelist and poets .
It has been an important subject especially for writers from the ' ' first generation '' like William Wordsworth ; he saw nature as an inseparable reality from man , whereas it comforts in sorrow and teaches to love and to act in a moral way .
In the Romantic Age we can find another important subject based on the concept of nature : the sublime .
It is associated with strong emotions caused natural spectacles , like hurricanes , waterfalls or starry sky
The sublime inspired many writers likeW. Wordworth and S. Coleridge , who had a conception of it as the feeling brought by the view of infinite spaces , like desert , sky or ocean .
The idea of the sublime that Wordswoth had is considered by many as the standard idea of the Romantic sublime : forms of nature that inspire feeling of awe , danger or weakness .
Also Coleridge had a concept of sublime , but for him it was associated with infinite spaces and the sense of perdition and suspense .
I am writing in order to apply for the position of summer camp assistant .
I am a 20 year old girl with an immense desire to get busy this summer .
I am very familiar with the tasks and rules that need to be respected in a summer camp , as I have been one in a previous summer camp within St John Ambulance .
It was an amazing and very instructive summer camp and I must say that I am the proud owner of the captain camp assistant badge .
It was in my duty to make sure everything was running smoothly , according to the program and I had to supervise and direct the other assistants if any problems should occur .
I am a qualified first aider and I am able to undertake any minor or major health problems that might arise .
I have been volunteering for St John Ambulance for 6 years now and I can say that it is a truly amazing and eye opening experience .
Thank you for taking the time to read my application and I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
Ms Magpie
The art of making a good impression .
An old saying goes ' You never get a second chance to make a first impression ' .
That 's always important when you meet someone for the first time , but especially when you come to a job interview .
Here are some tips to help you get a positive first impression .
Dress to impress
You should dress appropriately for the job that you want to get .
Men should wear a suit and a tie , and women should wear an appropriate blouse and skirt or pants .
Everyone should have clean hands and fingernails .
You should take no bags or backpacks along when you come to the interview .
Manners & Behavior
When you first meet the interviewer , shake his or her hand firmly .
Then you should thank the interviewer for the invitation .
Whatever happens , you should smile and keep cool .
If you are asked about yourself , you should n't tell your biography or something that has been written in your CV .
Instead of that you should show that you have experience or specific education in the area .
Try to avoid using filler words such as " like " , or " um " because they tell the interviewer that you 're nervous .
Dos & Don'ts
Do n't be late .
Do n't talk too much or too quickly .
Never use monosyllabic answers .
Do n't hesitate to ask questions .
Switch off your cellphone .
Maintain eye contact .
Relax and enjoy the moment .
Going on a job interview can be a stressful experience for even the most job seekers but if you use these tips , the first impression of you will be positive .
Good luck !
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing in response to the article about friendship that was published in your magazine .
I would like to share my feelings about a particular friendship that is highly important to me and furthermore evaluate the reasons why is especially complicated to maintain long lasting friendships in any situation .
First of all , as far as special friendships are concerned , I must say that I am not a person who makes friends easily , consequently I do not have a large circle of friends .
However , I can portray a unique relationship that I have with a generous and warmhearted person .
Although it is true that this is not a long term friendship I can admit that I have found a true friend .
Throughout this friendship I have been given the support , the affection and the confidence to pursue my dreams .
On the other hand , friendship is a two way street where you receive and give back the same favors and , naturally , I enjoy doing so .
I value this friendship and is of great importance to me because it is a balanced one of a kind relationship .
Secondly , I would like to say that maintaining friendships over time entails strenuous effort .
A justification for this may be the fact that over the years people change and grow apart .
For this reason not all childhood friends grow older as close confidants , simply because they are not the same people as they were before .
As you gradually grow up your world expands , your personality changes and so do your acquaintances .
However , the natural process of aging is not the only change we undergo but there are others such as enrolling in school , getting our first job or changing the old one , travelling or moving to another city .
All this situations may impede us to stay in touch with old friends but on the other hand can give us the opportunity to make new ones .
To summarize , I would like to say that even thought we are incapable to remain on friendly terms with everyone we should know that the process of socializing is one of the factors what makes us human and we should always embrace it .
Yours faithfully ,
Allison Green
Viña del Mar is a wonderful city on the west coast of Central Chile and boasts a number of shopping facilities and different sorts of attractions for tourists of all ages .
There are several shopping centres in different areas of the city .
The biggest and best one is the Marina Arauco Shopping Centre , located on 15 Norte St. It has two anchor department stores , Almacenes Paris and Almacenes Ripley , one at each end of the mall which is two blocks long .
There are four floors , each of which contains different departments of the anchor stores , and a number of small shops which sell a variety of products .
There is also a food court on the third floor , catering to all sorts of customers , as well as a few restaruants on the first and second floors .
On the top floor there is a multi - cinema complex , offering several options of the latest movies .
There are two underground floors for parking , which can get a bit crowded at peak seasons , but which are very reasonably priced .
Nearby there is also a large supermarket and a home store which offers products for building purposes , also connected to a shopping gallery .
Another shopping option is the main streeet in the centre of Viña del Mar , which used to be more popular in the past , but which was displaced by the shopping centres .
This street runs from the Viña Square towards the sea for about six or seven blocks , and has many small shops and businesses which attract a lot of people .
There is a parking meter system , which is not very cheap , compared to the shopping mall parking , and it can be difficult to find parking nearby .
There are several supermarkets and two anchor shops at one end of the street , which are convenient shopping venues for people who live in the city centre .
There are also other areas in Viña del Mar where groups of shops have concentrated so as to offer facilities to residential areas , also convenient for people who live in the surroundings .
All in all , I consider there is a wide variety of shopping options in our home town , so I expect tourists would not be disappointed with what there is to offer .

Dear Summer Camp Director ,
Hi , my name is Emma I 'm 16 years old and I believe that I would be perfect for this summer job .
I 'm have 2 little brothers and I think I 'm capable of taking care of little and older kids .
I 've always liked to play with kifds and make fun activities with them .
My favorite activities would be : painting , and making up fun games .
Although I like playing with kids of all ages , I think that I will have more things to do with the kid between ages 8 - 10 , because I find myself more open with kids between those ages .
I can cook anything , really , just give me the ingredients and I 'll make you whatever you want .
As I said before , I 'm really good with little kids , I 've been a teacher once at a summer school .
As the summer camp requires , I could honestly help with anything :
-Looking after children aged 8 - 12 .
-Help organise sports and evening activities .
-Work in the kitchens .
It was 8:00 o'clock in the morning that Saturday in L.A. , and suddenly an urgent message appeared in the TV news and in all the radio channels .
They announced that the Big One earthquake would occur that afternoon at 7:00 PM approximately , so they alerted that people had to leave the city or go to save places in the few hours .
From that moment , there was panic and chaos all over the city .
Peter 's father was the mayor of Los Angeles , so he had to calm down and inform the people regularly .
Peter decided to help his father with his work and the problems that were happening , while his mother was doing the luggage and preparing the car to leave .
Peter and his father were very busy solving problems of neighbours and it took them some hours .
They finished the work when it was 6:30 , so they had to leave the city quickly or they would die .
Finally , when they were in the car , Peter turned round and he saw a little boy in the road calling for help .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
I have really enjoyed SAWAN 2015 , and I would definitely participate in it again .
Narwal Ji has supported me throughout the preparation of this program .
As someone who hasn't sung classical before and has no background in Hindi Singing , I found it very confronting to sing at a concert after only four months of training .
However Narwal Ji has taught me from the basics of Indian singing , to being someone able to sing on stage in front of a large audience .
He had given me a great opportunity to grow as a beginner singer to sing during a concert and his guidance as a teacher is something that I will always appreciate .
He has given me a large amount of motivation , which led me to come all the way from Canberra to Melbourne to perform in this concert .
The night had been a rewarding experience and boosted my confidence a greatly .
In addition to this , the night was beautifully organised and each performance was professionally executed .
An original mix of cultures were represented consistently .
Overall the entire night was shown nicely and was entertaining for everyone watching .
There was no time left to be bored !
Dear sir ,
First I would like to thank you for your interest in our little town , and we will guarantee you a very warm welcome on the day of your arrival .
We will take great pleasure in helping the students to get around and feel at home in their accommodation .
You requested us to organise a visit to a place or building that mirrors one aspect of our life here .
We have brainstormed about many possibly interesting locations , and we eventually decided to prepare a little tour at and around the Grand Place of Brussels .
Away from busy and noisy roads , the beautiful old inner city reflects what Brussels really was for centuries ; small but cosy cobblestone streets flanked by small houess and shops in light colours and old - fashioned roofs .
In our opinion , the area around the Grand Place is the most beautiful part of the centre of Brussels and what really attracts so many visitors worldwide each year .
We would gladly share our excitement about the Grand Place with your students so that they can immediately get acquainted with it as a very enjoyable place to go to .
We hope to receive a positive answer soon , and again , I thank you for your time and interest .
Sincerely ,
Hi Mark ,
as you already know , I 'm from a little town , Kętrzyn .
Most of the year I live in Poznań , because of my studies at the University , but every summer I go back home to spend some time with my family and friends .
Last summer I decided to do something more than just relax and have fun , so I started to look for an interesting summer job .
Like I previously said , Kętrzyn is a rather small town , so there is only one old movie theatre and it 's closed for most the time .
It opens only in a time of summer , mainly for tourists .
Because of that , there are no regular employees , at the beginning of every summer new season stuff is hired .
So I decided to give it a try and I applied for that job .
It was the best summer ever .
You know how much I love watching movies , especially in small and cosy movie theatres .
It was like working in a paradise .
My duties were pretty simple .
Selling tickets , snacks and drinks , cleaning the place after and before the shows , so work itself was n't the exciting part .
The main reason why I loved to work there and every day I went to work with a big smile on my face were the possibilities to watch every show I wanted .
There is only one auditorium so I was busy just between the shows and sometimes , for family shows , there was a 15 minutes break in the middle of the show , for the kids to use the toilet or buy more snacks and drinks .
I watched almost every shown movie , some of them for more than once .
When my work there came to an end , I was happy , but on the other hand , I felt some kind of sadness too .
I mean , it was September , so I had a one whole month of vacation ahead of me to do whatever I wanted to and it was awesome because I could finally just relax , sleep , read books and spend a lot of time with my loved ones .
On the other hand , I was sad to leave that job .
This place really stole my heart and I miss its atmosphere , regular visitors and people I worked with .
I 'm planning to work there for the next summer too .
As you can see , my summer was great .
How about yours ?
I remember you were saying something about planning to go to India .
How was the trip ?
I bet it is an interesting story .
I look forward to hearing from you ,
Maciej

The line graph illustrates the amount and type of fast food eaten by teenagers in Australia between 1795 and 2000 .
As an overall trend , it is clear that consumption of fish and chips decreased over the period while the amount of pizzas and hamburgers eaten increased during the same period .
In 1975 the consumption of fish and chips was ten times higher than the consumption of the other two types of fast food .
However , the quantity of fish and chips plates eaten per year declined from 100 times per year in 1975 to just over 80 times in 1980 .
Then , there was a slight increase to about 95 times per year in 1985 .
After that , this trend kept falling and reached the lowest point in 2000 ( just under 40 times that year ) .
In contrast , the consumption of hamburgers and pizzas started at about 10 times for hamburgers and 5 times for pizzas in 1975 , and then rose constantly until it reached approximately 100 times and 85 times respectively in 1995 .
It then levelled off during the next 5 years .

Work in the Cafe will also allow me to meet people from the neighborhood , which is very important for me right now , since I just moved in .
Sometimes I do n't have time for myself to have fun , and for what I can see from your place , it is very popular and full of fun people .
I can show all my recommendation letters from my previous jobs , but I 'll say right now that they all say good things about me .
I do n't want to look like a jerk , that 's not it .
I really work hard .
I take my jobs seriously and try my best to never let my bosses down .
I try to never let my personal problems interfere in my professional life , and if it does some day , I would ask you to tell me , so I can change .
I think you will like me .
I 'm very eclectic , but also fierce where I should be .
I always have respect for my bosses and , of course , clients .

I will never miss a day , unless it is very important , you can be sure of that .
I may not know how to cook the usual food from the cafe , but I am a fast learner . I will only need one day to get used to the food and learn how to practise at home , and then it 's up to me find a way to be good at it .
I 'll take my time to practise everything I can at home .
I wo n't be much problem for anyone .
I could say that I am a funny person , but that would be a lie .
I 'm not .
My father said one day that , as a humorist , I 'm a very good singer , and I do n't even sing .
I 'll be nice , though .
I 'll make them love me .
I hope you can give me a chance to show how much I want this job .
Yours , Geédes .
Set in in the late 1950s France , Chocolat deals with the topic of society discriminating against different people because of their being different : whether they are gypsies , women that do n't depend on men , or people that do n't share the Christian faith .
The plot revolves around Vianne Rocher , a single mother and chocolate expert , opening a ' chocolaterie ' right before Lent in a small , close - minded French village , the mayor of which decides to boycott her .
During Lent , the protagonist gets to know other outcasts ( mainly women ) and help them .
However , Vianne must learn to solve her own problems and change the course of her own life .
One of the strengths of the film is its star - studded cast : Juliette Binoche as Vianne , Alfred Molina as the mayor , Judi Dench as a grumpy , elder woman resented with the oppressing society of the village , and a young Johnny Depp as a handsome gypsy arriving in town with his caravan .
Each and every one of the roles is beautifully written and the actors do n't fail in bringing them to life .
Besides the cast , I would like to highlight the original soundtrack .
It adapts perfectly to the theme of the movie , with a little bit of jazz manouche , a popular genre amongst European gypsy communities , and reminiscences of Mexican folklore , as the recipes Vianne Rocher prepares in the ' chocolaterie ' are a heritage from her Maya ancestors .
If I had to find a down side to Chocolat , it would be that the film format does not allow us to have a deeper look into some of the characters and their storylines .
Had it not been written in the year 2000 , but today , I am sure that this story would have been turned into a successful TV series in which we could have learnt more about the past and the future of those fantastic characters .
All in all , this is a gripping , moving , and entertaining film that will make you reflect on some social issues .
A must - see if , like me , you enjoy cinema with strong female characters on the lead roles , but you do not necessarily want to watch another dramatic story .
Michael Clifford was a lucky man who had everything he could ever want : he was a thirty - year - old English businessman married to a sophisticated mathematician with whom he had two sons and a pretty talented daughter ; he owned a successful corporation and had a gorgeous chalet near the sea .
One night , having ended a meeting with an important sponsor , Michael decided to enter a pub with one of his colleagues in order to celebrate the successful meeting .
He hardly ever drunk alcohol , but thought it would be impolite not to , as he had been invited by his colleague .
Therefore , he proceeded to have some drinks and to enjoy the night .
Later that night , while Michael was cheerful chatting with the barman , his mobile phone emitted a sound .
He took a look at it and saw a message from his wife .
Worried , he opened it and read , in horror , how his wife had had an accident and was in hospital .
He rushed out of the pub , open the car and went inside , not knowing that he was to die in an accident because of his current state .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Travelling has become a great part of our daily lives , whether we only go to the nearby grocery store or choose to visit our relatives who live in another country .
Modern means of transport are constantly improving , being faster and more comfortable than ever before .
However , it is a wise decision to choose carefully between public and personal transport , because they have both advantages and disadvantages depending on where we want to travel .
On the one hand , personal cars are great because they allow people to travel whenever they want .
This means they are able to have a flexible schedule .
Another advantage of cars is the fact that they are family friendly , meaning that people who use them do n't have to worry about travelling with strangers who might be dangerous .
On the other hand , cars are not only expensive to purchase , they also require fuel , which is very expensive .
Sometimes it is cheaper to use public transport such as busses , trains or airplanes , depending on the distance .
Travelling across the Atlatic Ocean for example requires an airplane or a ship .
Trains are a great way of transport across intercontinental distances , especially since they have become faster .
Statistically speaking , car accidents are much more frequent than plane crashes or train accidents , so public transport is not only cheaper sometimes , but it 's also safer and faster .
All in all , I believe that public transport will not disappear too soon .
Airplanes , busses , trains or ships are here to stay because they are more practical in some situations .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Time was ticking by and he knew that if he did n't do it now he would be in deep trouble , that his social life would be over .
" Tick " .
He seriously needed a break , a few minutes to relax .
" Tock " .
He was getting more and more nervous as the time passed by .
" Tick " .
Time was n't passing fast enough for Peter .
" Tock " .
He knew he was n't going to make it .
" Ring ! " The bell rang .
Peter flew from the classroom and tried to squeeze himself between the multiple students that were evacuating their classes .
All of them anxious to get outside and relax for a few hours Suffering from an endless punishment : knowledge .
As he got near his destination the density of students seemed to grow and it was becoming even more difficult for him to advance in that sea of moving bodies .
Fortunatley ,
the bathroom was just a few meters away .
Poland is classed as a country with a hard history and a lot of places remind about it .
Besides their past we can , fortunately adore their beauty .
One of these places is , undoubtedly , Kazimierz , the Old Jewish district of Cracow .
In this small part of Cracow , you can meet with Jewish culture and the architectural style .
First , you should visit the New Cemetery .
It was established in 1800 .
For those who enter it will be an ' unforgettable ' experience .
You walk among ancient , fallen tombs shaded by high trees of great age .
Then , you really must visit the synagogues : The Temple Synagogue , Isaac Synagogue , The Tall Synagogue and Remuh Synagogue .
The synagogue is still being used as a place of prayer for the few remaining Jewish people in Cracow or for visitors from Israel or other parts of the world .
For the history lovers , I recommend going to the Historical Museum of The History and Culture of Jewish People .
It is the oldest synagogue in Poland and was constructed in the XV century .
Inside there is an impressive number of handicrafts , graphics and paintings .
Finally , you can do shopping on The New Square , a round trading hall .
You can buy there almost everything : fresh fruits , vegetables , and household products .
On Sundays , the gamut of products is much more bigger .
If you are a good browser you may find some original souvenirs of Cracow to take home with you .
I think the Kazimierz is one of the most beautiful places in Poland .
It 's appealing and full of this eerie spirit of the past .
That 's why you must see it !
Parents face with important decisions when raising children , not the least of which is whether or not they should allow their children to keep a pet .
Some parents would grasp in horror and reject it when their child asks them if he can keep a pet with him , whereas other parents would be more than happy to let their children have a pet .
In my view , I believe that children should have pets because they can benefit from taking care of pets , especially in terms of their personality development .
Specifically , they learn to take responsibility when taking care of pets .
Take my cat , Luka , for example , I found it on the streets and felt like keeping it with me when I was 12 years old .
My mother told me that you would have to take care of it by yourself when I went to ask her if I could keep the cat .
Since that day , I started to take care of on my own .
I took it to the hospital when it was sick , and bought it food when it needed to be fed .
I have therefore fostered a sense of responsibility since then .
So , according to my personal experiences , I think that children can benefit from keeping a pet .
Some people might argue that it is always parents who take care of the pets most of the time , instead of children themselves .
Namely , parents always do things for children , such as housework , homework , even taking care of the pets for their children .
Nevertheless , what those people have claimed is a digression from the topic here .
This does not suggest that children can not learn from having a pet with them .
Why children can not learn is because of their parents , not because of the pets .
In other words , taking care of pets is absolutely beneficial to children so long as they are given an opportunity .
Moreover , children can also learn to sympathize with others by keeping a pet , apart from leaning to be responsible .
For instance , when Luka died when I was 20 years old , I was so sad and heart - broken as if one member was lost in our family .
After that day , I started to be able to sympathize with people who have lost their beloved ones because I have been through a similar situation .
Thus , keeping pets does enable people to be able to put themselves in others ' shoes .
Given upon my personal experiences , by taking care pets , children not only can learn to take responsibility , but also can learn to sympathize with others .
In other words , keeping pets is beneficial to children in terms of their personality development .
On the other hand , if children are not allowed to keep a pet , the parents will have to come up with other ways to make the children both responsible and sympathetic .
We always believe that a city should never compromise the environment for the sake of development .
Not only financial development but also the environment is essential to a healthy city .
With this belief , we endeavor to keep our city as clean and attractive as possible .
Here , we are proud to report our accomplishments thus far .
We stick to the principle of 3Rs , namely reduce , reuse and recycle .
Reducing waste at source is always our top priority and education is of utmost importance in this regard .
Nothing is more difficult than changing one 's mindset given people 's inertia .
Hence , we have incorporated the concept of environmental protection into our curriculum so that students can develop an awareness of the matter at a young age .
Different activities , including seminars and exhibitions have been held in different districts to spread the message of environmental conservation across the community .
Recycling bins have been installed in every public housing estate and most housing estates , along with the road - side ones found in every district .
Public Housing Estate Recycle Competitions have also been held every year to promote the concept of recycling plastic , paper or tin and to help the residents cultivate such a habit in daily life .
We are glad that our work has started to bear fruits in recent years .
We have seen a great drop in the number of solid waste .
Apart from keeping our city clean by reducing waste , we also dedicate ourselves to building a green city .
Tree planting campaign is carried out every year in cooperation with schools , community centres , etc .
Eco - tour is also promoted to educate the public and tourists to appreciate the beauty of nature and , above all , to arouse their awareness and cultivate a caring heart towards nature .
With concerted efforts , we have made a great stride in environmental protection in recent years as seen in the declining number of waste and increasing number of greenery .
We believe we will continue to make progress and make our home a better place to live in .
The round table ' Russia - Turkey : prospects of relations at the modern stage ' in St Petersburg State University
On April 29 , 2014 St. Petersburg state University hosted the round table " Russia - Turkey : prospects of relations at the modern stage " .

Prospects for the future " , " Crimea between Russia , Ukraine and Turkey .
Historical and political analysis " , " Internal policy of Turkey and its impact on Russian - Turkish relations " and other aspects of political , economic and cultural cooperation between our countries .
The international round table was devoted to the study of Russian - Turkish relations .

Novikova , the Dean of the SPSU School of International Relations and Professor ; V.S Yagja , the Head of the Department of World Politics of the SPSU School of International Relations , Doctor of History and Professor ; A.A. Sotnichenko , Associate Professor of the Department of Theory and History of International Relations of the SPSU School of International Relations ; Bekir Günay , Historian and Associate Professor of Istanbul University , the Director of the Eurasian Institute ; Ali Ertuğrul Turkeli , the General Secretary of the Turkish - Russian Cultural Foundation in Istanbul .

Bekir Günay , the Director of the Eurasian Institute , Associate Professor , told about a new understanding of Eurasianism .
He also broached a subject of the Eurasian Community development , noting that it 's very important if it 's developing to the equality or dominance .
A.A. Sergunin , Professor of the Department of Theory and History of International Relations of the SPSU School of International Relations , Doctor of Political Science , gave a speech on the Eastern Partnership of the European Union .

He also referred to the recent action of the Turkish authorities on sudden introduction of new requirements to the expiration of foreign passports .
Just before the beginning of mass tourism season in Turkey , it was announced that the passport should be valid at least four months from the date of entry .
Fortunately , Turkey postponed the law coming into force .
The round table in St. Petersburg State University has attracted quite a large audience .
During the break the participants enjoyed traditional Turkish sweets .
People often forget how important it is to help save the environment on a day - to - day basis , yet I believe it is not only the first step , but the most important to public awareness .
Living in a big city I can cycle to work every day , which I believe is a great way to exercise and reduce my environmental footprint .
Besides , cycling along a canal allows me to witness flowers and trees blossoming and fowls ' chicks growing up , reminding me of the beauty of nature .
However I believe that it is at home that I contribute most to saving natural resources ; we are , obviously , very careful with turning off the taps as we wash our hands , brush our teeth and so on , and we recycle as much as possible .
Yet , our most rewarding action has been starting a compost .
We feed worms our food and organic waste , which has drastically decreased it .
Moreover , we now use the compost for our garden patch and cacti .
Another good point : we have converted our next door neighbour !
Composting has made us more aware of our waste and the amount of packaging in the items we buy .
I 'd definitely recommend it to everyone , whether they live in a flat or in a house with a garden .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
We live in the mass consumption century , when it requires more and more time of our daily routines .
For some this activity is a torture , for others it is the most pleasurable way of spending free time .
But have you ever gone to the shop just for milk and bread and came back with a full bag of goods but no bread ?
First of all , shopping is unavoidable as it is necessary to shop for food .
It depends on a person how often he goes to grocery , probably according to individual needs .
Most of consumers do not count time spent in food stores , as they have their own habits and their attitudes towards shopping .
Some people choose bigger supermarkets as they offer greater variety of goods , but require more time , while others just pop into the closest store and do their shop weekly .
If you have a already made shopping list , it saves your time and energy , so that you do not need to wander between rows in grocery store .
When it comes to parties it is even more time consuming and irksome , than the ordinary one .
Moreover , the most annoying is the last stage of buying goods - waiting in queues in order to pay .
The queue you are standing in seems to be always the longest .
Secondly , shopping in supermarkets is extremely irritating before annual celebrations , or during seasonal sales .
Hundreds gather there , parking spaces are full , again facing longest queues in stores - how much unpleasant is souds , it is the reality of nowadays .
People become crazy , nervous or dull while shopping .
Afterwards some get into their cars and get stuck in traffic jams on the way home , it causes more tension and disimproves mood !
Also , some people spend huge sums of money on things that are not essential , they are attracted by commercials , advertisements , sales assistant recommendations , so they do not follow their budgets by buying everything , as they are excited by the shopping process itself , it causes regrets and financial problems afterwards .
Finally , it may be very fatigue , as you may waste the precious time just by walking around but not finding the thing are interested in and need .
Then you feel tired and depressed about the idea of keep looking for it in another place .
On the other hand , the majority feel lazy and they go shopping just for special occasions , without any rush , they dedicate time in search of fashionable clothes , best quality garmets , stylish items .
It comes as no surprise that women love shopping .
Although , shopping may be entertaining , it is still a time consuming and tiresome job .
Being busy and spending time looking for clothes , presents , souvenirs , furniture or healthcare products especially for women may be a perfect way of spending even all day .
On the other hand , searching for your favourite brands , non - seasonal products , some special goods , just looking through shelves , trying the garmets on you , asking for consultations , testing products , there is plenty of work to do to make a perfect purchase .
This may be the reason why some go for bread and milk and forget about it , after entering a colourful and attractive store .
All in all , I strongly believe that shopping is not enjoyable by the vast majority .
Fortunately , this unnavoidable part of our lives is not that problematical anymore , as we may experience the pleasures of online shopping without leaving home .
It is a perfect alternative to save time , money and energy for those who are not that willing to hit the mall .
The letter that changed my life
It all began with my older sister Jennifer , as everything used to begin with her .
She always wanted to be in the spotlights , in which she had always succeeded , since everyone adored her .
Quite understandable , because Jennifer had the most beautiful , big blue eyes as well as thick blonde hair , a magnificent smile and an outstanding shape .
Until we received that remarkable letter , I had always been in her shadow .
Anyway , just before the letter arrived , we were sitting in the living room .
I was doing homework , while Jennifer was posing for the mirror . "
Oh my God , I look absolutely gorgeous in this dress ! , " she shouted . "
Do n't you think I should wear this during the premiere ? "
She was expecting a letter of the local drama club , in which they would reveal the character list of their new play .
Jennifer had auditioned , and she was 100% sure that she would become the main woman .
I had also auditioned , only because my best friends pushed me very hard , and I was 100% sure that I would n't even get a small role in the play .
Then , suddenly , we heard something falling on the doormat . "
Oh my God , oh my God , that must be the letter of the drama club ! " , Jennifer screamed .
She immediately ran to the doormat , ran back to the living room and showed me the envelope in her hands .
I looked up as she opened the envelope .
Jennifer started to read the letter aloud , very excited - at first .
" Dear Jennifer and Carly Brown , We are delighted to inform you that Carly is chosen to become the main woman of our new play .
Well done , Carly !
We found your audition amazing .
Unfortunately , your audition was really bad , Jennifer , so we could not give you a role in our play .
Kind regards , The Cornish Drama Club . "
I could n't believe my ears ! I , Carly Brown , the insipid and far less interesting sister of the great Jennifer Jones , the most beautiful girl in town , was chosen to become the main woman in a big play !
I , and not my sister !
She was n't even given a small role in the play .
From that moment on , I haven't been in Jennifer 's shadow anymore - she was in my shadow .
The industrial revolution took place in England from the end of 18th century to the middle of the 19th and it completely transformed this place .
English economy changed from an agriculture one to an industrial one : in England there was an increase in pollution and also terrible hygienic conditions , the landscape changed a lot and also houses , shops and people .
These strong changes influenced very much the poetry and we can see that for example in Blake , because in " The Tyger " he uses a lot of colors referred to the industrial life ( red , orange , silver .. ) and he describes the Tyger 's creator as an artisan that create it on a furnace .
Instead the American and French revolutions are important because they introduced the idea of freedom , fraternity and equality , so also these concepts influenced strongly the poetry of the period .
We can see the conceit of freedom in Shelley 's " Ode to the West Wind " , where the wind is wild and it is the very symbol of freedom ; instead , in the " Rime of the Ancient Mariner " , we can see the brotherhood of mariners in the ship and of party guests and also the equality of all the God 's creatures .
The idea of brotherhood is present also in " I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud " by Wordsworth because he sees nature , daffodils in this case , as a friend to men .
During recent thirteen years , the cost of living has been significantly increasing in most countries .
This change makes most people have to work every day even using their private time , so they need to find out the best way to save their time and fill their energy after work .
Fast food is one of ways to solve that problem .
This essay will examine some advantages and disadvantages of eating fast food .
There are huge positive effects of eating fast food .
First of all is convenience .
People who have just done their work are very hungry ; they can not go to home and cook their diet meals by themselves but their bodies need to be provided energy in order to sustain their lives and continue their jobs , so junk food is considered the best way to solve the hunger .
To make it clear , the bosses , who are always busy in their business , usually eat fast food , they go to KFC or Lottie Mart to buy them they even might get fast food by phone because of fast delivery .
In addition , Junk food is very easy to be found out .
There are numerous stores and restaurants which have junk food built everywhere .
Therefore , finding a good place to buy and enjoy a meal with fast food is not so difficult and it will not take time for people to go back their work on time .
On the other hand , eating fast food frequently may lead to some negative effects on customer 's health .
Firstly , fast food is unhealthy .
Junk food contains large unhealthy chemicals such as high percentage of fat and cholesterol which are the most reasons leading customers to obesity and cancers .
According to scientists they said that people who usually eat plenty of junk food will have more than 50% of risks to get obese and even die soon .
Furthermore , most of junk food just solves hunger in a short time and then it will quickly return to the customers after they have felt full .
Finally is the loss of traditional meals .
People prefer buying and eating fast food to making a healthy meal .
As the consequence , they gradually forget how to cook a simple meal and the diversity of healthy food is slightly gone .
In conclusion , there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages of fast food .
Some advantages are that fast food can help to save time and deal with the temporary hunger for white - collar - worker , but it can also harm their health .
The customer should be careful before they choose fast food to be a part of their daily diet .
Facebook is the most popular social networking site of all time .
Within 6 years , Facebook has reached more than 1 billion users and still growing rapidly .
I would n't consider myself against it , although I am aware of the risks .
First of all , I think Facebook , for example , is a great way for shy people to socialize , because it can boost their self - esteem , considering the fact that they do n't have to meet anyone face - to - face .
It 's also great if we want to manage our friendships , or create new ones .
As a shy person , I can confirm the differences between real life and virtual interacion .
Social networking sites also benefit those who have " unusual " hobbies or those who have a hard time finding people with similar interests .
For example , if you want to find someone who likes the same movie genders or series on social media , all you have to do is type in an interest .
On the other hand , we are also exposed to many risks , such as cyberbullying or online predators .
While it can seem harmless , cyberbullying causes many problems among teenagers , such as depression , suicidal thoughts or even worse .
Spending too much time on the internet also has harmful effects on our family lives , because we tend to forget how important it is to spend time with those who love us .
To conclude , although social media seems flawless , we should always be careful and responsible before we sign up .
Dear Camp Director ,
I saw the advertisement for a job to work this summer camp .
I really thought I would be the right person for this .
I have always wanted to be part of something like this .
I am really hardworking and love kids , I used to babysit for my neighbour 's kids , so looking after kids will be easy for me .
I am also very cheerful and energetic , and am very good at organising fun activities .
Working in the kitchen does not seem so bad either , because I know that everything depends on our attitude and if I have a positive attitude I 'll have a good time no matter if I 'm doing a fun activity or cleaning dishes .
I hope you think I 'm the right person for this , I think this would be a great experience for me as well as for the kids .
People and Change "
This is certainly true and corresponds with my experience .
Some people do manage to stay in the same place all their lives and even work for the same company , while others are much more mobile in terms of their jobs and homes .
I feel that this can be attributed in the first instance to the changing nature of modern societies .
In the past , it was the norm for people to live in a limited geographical area all their lives and be involved in the same type of occupation all their working lives .
There was simply no alternative to this , especially if you lived in an agricultural society .
However , with the rise of industry and specialized companies , it became possible for workers to move jobs , often to places far away .
Following on from this , as a society 's wealth increased , people had skills and training to allow them to be much more selective about which employer they want to work for and choices about how and when they wanted to change the type of job they wished to do .
We are , therefore , in a situation in many countries today where to be highly mobile is something
that people take for granted and regard as perfectly normal .
With the opportunity for change comes choice , although circumstances , economic and personal , can often force people to do what they might not normally choose .
Therefore , it happens that some people want change in their lives but are not able to effect it .
This might be because they have strong obligations to family , might need to look after someone or might simply not have marketable skills to find a livelihood somewhere else .
There are others , of course , who are quite happy to live and work in the same place all their lives because they do not think moving would enhance their lives .
Some are happy to stay put because they would find it very stressful to endure change .
It is perhaps the majority nowadays who find change refreshing because of the new opportunities it holds out and the possibilities of getting on professionally and socially .
For myself , I very much belong to this group .
Even though the boat was ready to go Jessica was afraid for it to break in pieces again , she almost could foresee that forthcoming heavy rain destroying her boat , so she had an idea .
She tied the boat with long and very strong textiles made out of synthetic fibers that she found on the plane ; she also used nails to join some new and more resistant wood into the boat .
She was ready to leave but something inside her was telling her to stay , the boat was very resistant but not enough to travel for days and maybe weeks across the ocean , she was afraid .
Meanwhile Jacob is completely in love with that girl he met weeks before , her name was Scarlett , she said that her dad was in the military and was working on a high - tech portable device that will change gravity in low levels and in a short period of time , like a fraction of a second , but it was later suspended because their boss told them it was very dangerous to experiment on and it was going to be very expensive , but as her dad continued with the experiment his boss got so mad he kicked them from the city into that mysterious island .
She also explained that they did n't know how the majority of people on the island got there , thereby not all of them spoke the same language , but they learned how to communicate with signs .
They had a lot of things in common , they liked the same kind of music , the same kind of food and they both liked to read about fantasies and comics .
Jacob told her again if she wanted to go with him to a better place but she still denied , until she accepted with only one condition , if all her family could go with them .
Jacob told Jessica if they could leave the island with Scarlett 's family , she was not happy about it but she said yes .
But they needed to make the boat even more resistant and rigid so it will support all the family and all the extra food they will need .
Abortion is a controversial issue in our society today .
Some Pro - choice groups and individuals believe that a person have to right of choice , this includes the right to decide if they want to give birth or not .
Contradicting the Pro - choice groups , Pro - life supporters consider terminating any pregnancy unjustifiable .
Even though in some circumstances , such as life threatening and sexual abuse pregnancies , it could be the best thing to do .
Hence , every woman must be able to have abortion as a choice .
Abortion can be given as an option in life threatening.pregnancies .
The presence of a mother is important in a child 's life especially in the first few months .
During the first months , he relationship between a mother and a child rapidly develops .
The baby 's inborn capacity of imitation and regulation of visual and auditive stimulation , is gradually patterned and this is supported by the mother 's empathetic response .
( Lier.l,1988 )
This natural process would be interrupted by the absence of the mother and the child 's development could be in this case negatively influenced .
Development of emotional and psychological problem such as maternal deprivation can be a result .
The child will have difficulties building and sustaining relationships during adult - life .
Because of this risk abortion can be considered an option .
Besides , abortion could also be considered in case of impregnation as a result of sexual abuse .
Impregnation as a result of sexual abuse is not uncommon and in these cases abortion should be a choice .
Sexual violence has a devastating impact on victims , all areas of a victim 's life is affected .
Recovering is a hard and complicated process and when you add a pregnancy to this equation it just makes it even more painful .
In fact , this is the main reason why sexually assaulted victims choose to have an abortion .
Many victims believe that the additional trauma related to carrying their rapist child can be avoided by terminating the pregnancy , and therefore help them put the assault behind them and recover more quickly .
Even though , not all victims will choose to have an abortion it has to be given as an option .
Even if , abortion has to be given as a choice in special cases , it is not a solutions for accidental pregnancies .
It is for the person who decides to have coitus to make sure to use appropriate anti conception .
Otherwise , you may run the risk that people seeing abortion as an easy way to get rid of an unwanted pregnancy .
In order to prevent this , it is important to apply strict guidelines regarding situation where abortion is given as an option .
Abortion only has to be approved as an option in life threatening.pregnancies or if the mother has been sexually molested .
Undeterred by this , it still the mother 's decision if she wants to save her own life or carry and care for her rapist child .
I am pleased to recommend Dr. Oscar Montés for a teaching position at IHME and the Department of Global Health within the School of Medicine and the School of Public Health at the University of Washington .
I had the opportunity to be a student and work as a research assistant with Dr. Montés in the same field .
I can definitely affirm that he has excellent teaching skills .
I took the following subjects : Master 's degree final project II , Global Health , and Health Systems under the tutoring of Mr Montés .
He taught to people from different backgrounds , to undergraduate and postgraduate students , and managed to explain difficult public health topics marvellously .
Also in Master 's degree final project II , Dr Montés helped us to accomplish the master 's degree thesis with excellence .
In my work as a research assistant for Dr. Montés , I experienced great learning in many fields , not only in Public Health topics but also in research methodology , public speaking , and writing .
I witnessed and learn form his ability to work with other faculties such as Faculty of Medicine , Department of Engineering , Faculty of Economics , and School Law .
I assisted to policy making forums and events where Dr Montés was a speaker and his opinion was highly respected .
Moreover , we developed projects with multidisciplinary teams for the following institutions : the Colombian Ministry of Health , and the World Bank with excellent results .
I reckon Dr Montés fulfils the requirements of the position you offer .
Since he has great expertise teaching , and an excellent boss , respectful of the opinion , time , and personal background of everybody .
I think that he will be great asset for your college .
I 'm writing in response of the letter the professor Collins wrote to you .
In the letter he complaints about the out - of - date system of schools in Italy and he made some suggestions about how this could be overcome by major educational reforms .
First of all , the professor says that the majority of Italian teachers are not well prepared to do their work and , consequently , students do n't achieve the skills they should to success in a future work , but I do n't agree with this statement .
I think that the real problem that makes our schools so out - of - date comparing to that of other countries is the way teachers get in touch with students and transmit them their knowledge .
As a matter of fact students are often seen as empty pitchers ready to be filled by as many information as they can contain .
Teachers should n't talk about their subjects without caring if their students are really listening to what they 're saying or not , and they should n't let them study just because they must .
They should make their students live school as a pleasant experience , as something their future is based on .
Secondly , in his letter the professor suggests that schools should spend more money on computer equipment .
I agree with this recommendation because I think it 's important for schools to make the same progresses the society does year by year , offering always new materials and technologies , such as computers or interactive whiteboards in classrooms , making studying more interesting and sometimes also easier .
This is what , in my opinion , must be changed in schools to satisfy the society necessities and overcome the old and inappropriate " out - of - date " system .
Should schools spend more on computers and software than on textbooks ?
Nowadays , students can work with computers at school and most of them have one at home .
Many people feel that it is good to do their student life easier .
However , it also has some disadvantages .
On the one hand , I firmly believe that students can find more valuable information on textbooks because they have existed for many centuries .
For this reason , I believe that they have content more reliable .
Furthermore , if you go to a library , you could spend all day seeing books and learning about different things so in these places there are many ancient books .
On the other hand , I personally think that pupils enjoying more working with textbooks because they can do this activity with classmates and they can help each other .
Also , in my opinion , young people should not use computers for much time because this could be dangerous for their health , appearing sight problems or headaches .
Taking everything into account , in my opinion every student should have a good encyclopaedia at home because it is much better for their education .
There is a lot of people I admire , starting with my own parents as they have to work so hard to end lines and to pay the rent as well as their employees and to give us- my brother and me- a good living today and future tomorrow .
When talking about famous people , I usually point out J.K. Rowling .
As a writer - to - be I admire her work creating a fantastic world of magic and epic as well as dark characters which are recognizable all around the globe .
That is why , in fact , I am a big fan of George R.R. Martin as well .
His ' Song of fire and ice ' saga has been brought into the television world in the name of Game of thrones and it is currently being awarded as the best drama tv series of all times .
However , when talking about great achievements , I will always talk about people like Nelson Mandela , Martin Luther King or Rosa Parks .
My fascination about those people is that they fought for their people 's rights , black race 's rights , in a world of white people treating them as slaves and bullying them .
That is why , nowadays , I feel a huge admiration for Malala Youszafi .
She 's an Indian teenage girl and fights for education all over the world .
And not only for boys but for girls too .
In her country , education for girls was forbidden but she stood up against this situation , going to school and even being shot for that .
But she never stopped .
She never stops .
Because knowledge is the best weapon we got against those who want to rule us as they want .
I am at home in my lovely house , where I love every detail of the interier , where every thing is on its place .
Our house is clean and comfortable , me and my family love to spend time at home .
I have two lovely kids .
My elder son is 20 already .
It is weekend and we all together today .
Every weekend we leave everything and meet to spend time together , to share news , love and plans .
We play piano , sing favorite songs , play table games , we laugh a lot and love these weekends together very much .
Sometimes our kids invite friends and today my son came with his girlfriend .
I am calm and confident .
After all this courses that I 've done I am wise and do n't talk a lot .
I enjoy every moment and people love to be with me .
Next to me everybody feel calm and confident . I 've learned a lot in the last 15 years .
And you will hardly recognize the old me .
Every word I say I say for a reason .
My kids are proud to have parants like me and my husband .
Together we make this world a better planet .
We found a way to help a lot of people to live happy life and enjoy what they have .
It is my birthday tomorrow .
We 've planed a nice event to celebrate my 50 .
Friends , colleagues , family all thes people who was next to me on this way to this wonderful day .
The day when I am proud of myself , happy to look back and curious to look forward .
If you 've been following my blog , you 'll know that I 've been on a journey of discovery and creation concerning using technology to create materials and using technology to teach .
I have just started teaching a new , face to face group of adults .
I was excited to get back into the classroom , I mainly teach online today , and try out some of my new skills on a group .
I checked the equipment : I had a computer and projector , both in good working order , a fast internet connection and a full class .
I was ready and raring to go .....
As soon as the lights went out , the atmosphere changed in the classroom and I felt the tension rise .
One student said that she could n't see well , another student complained that the writing was too small , another felt she was getting too hot from the projector .
The group 's native language is Amharit ; they have all had to learn Hebrew , so English is a third or for some of them a fourth language .
I 'd chosen a method of teaching that was not suitable for the group .
This is a group of beginners , the experience of a first lesson with a new teacher is daunting enough , without adding unfamiliar technology and teaching methods .
So I switched off the projector , took out my white board pen , dusted off my flash cards and reverted back to traditional methods of teaching .
We 've had three lessons so far and I 'm thoroughly enjoying teaching this group ; it 's a pleasure to teach face - to - face and a challenge to teach adults at this level ; it 's really great to get ' back to basics ' .
This experience has reminded me that although there are many advantages to using technology in the class room , it 's not always appropriate and it 's helped me to establish some equilibrium in my teaching methods .
Instead of creating some online lessons for this wonderful group , I have taken the opportunity to create some new printable materials to hand out in class .
This post will be the first of three on the topic of the Present Simple tense , it contains a printable infographic covering the basics of the Present Simple and two printable worksheets .
Are young people less healthy than they were years ago ?
Nowadays , there is an increasing concern about the health of young people , since there is no doubt that it is getting worse .
To begin with , recent statistics reveal that obese adolescents ' ratio is rising .
As well as that , the lifestyle of our society is pushing us to be more passive .
And last but not least , it seems that new technologies are not helping to develop their social and intellectual skills .
The reasons could be , firstly , fast food is cheaper and very accessible for young people .
In addition , spending too much time in activities like watching TV , surfing the Internet or playing video games prevent them from doing sports .
And finally , teenagers may become more dependent and introverted because of electronic devices such as mobile phones or personal computers .
Actually , it is not complicated to change habits in order to be healthier .
For instance , filling the fridges with a great amount of fresh fruit and vegetables , doing some exercise and have some fun with friends regularly .
Hi Ben
How are you ? I 'm taking a year off and staying in London for six months so I hope you can help me if it is n't too much to ask .
I 'd like to find a part - time job but first of all I have to find an apartment to live , so I was wondering if you can look for a small apartment where I can live in ; it would be better if it 's near the underground station and in the city centre so that I can go sightseeing in my free time .
Maybe you would n't mind helping me to find a job .
Would you be so kind as to let me know if there are some restaurants or pubs that need staff ?
I 'm looking for a well - paid job because I know that houses are expensive in the city centre .
I 'm looking forward to being there , I also need to take a rest and that 's the reason why I want to find a part - time and not a full - time job .
I hope I 'm not asking too much and I 'd be really pleased if you 'll give me your help .
Thanks you very much .
Love , Valeria
Advances in computer science have created a tremendous leap in technical innovations .
One of the most recent outstanding innovations is robotics .
Lavine , Voss and Coontz ( 2007 ) define robotics as the combination of " automation with action and at times a considerable amount of mobility " which is " becoming more and more humanoid"(p .
1083 ) .
The more computer science influences human 's lives , the more important status robotics has in the field of engineering .
Only a decade year ago , robotics was just limited to scientific research .
However , today it is used in more fields , such as medical treatment , elderly - nursing and archaeological studies , as well as education .
This essay will discuss the current social consequences of robotics in the area of education , and then conclude by commenting on its possible future implications .
In the first place , robotics activity could provide learners with real situations which are related to irrelative courses , especially in scientific and medical ones .
Tanzawa et al . (
2012 ) described an experiment from Showa University which aimed to test how well dental students could deal with emergency situation .
The result indicated that although the patients were merely robots , out of 98 candidates , only 22% students correctly gave the diagnoses .
From a survey , 78% and 72% of students considered robot patients to be useful in medical emergency and risk training , whilst 63% of them thought it had a great value in training for surgical treatment .
It is obvious that in this experiment , students could acquire knowledge more effectively and teachers could also realize weakness of students specifically .
Second , robotics can be taken advantage of to make studying and teaching effective and efficient .
University of Southern Denmark organized an experiment , which aimed to examine how well robotics techniques named I - BLOCKS ( a modular electronic building block system ) could do on language tests .
Surprisingly , the result illustrated that these robots can not only put words in right order grammatically , but also recognise whether a sentence is correct or not .
Furthermore , the I - BLOCKS application could also build structures of robots which are smart to react to surroundings , and build binary expression to calculate in real - time and show both final results and sub - results ( Lund , Marti , & Palma , as cited in Nielsen & Lund , 2008 ) .
With the help of robotics , like I - BLOCKS , students and teachers might spend less time on studying and some sophisticated processes are simplified as well .
Nevertheless , robotics is not that satisfying because it is complicated to operate which is always the reason why operators are distracted .
Suh et al . ( 2010 ) described an experiment that aimed to test differences of time on operating robots to do tasks .
Two groups of participants were asked to do suture - tying task and a secondary task with distraction , such as decision - making , memory - task .
They are Group A : ten medical students aged 19 - 27 who only had general knowledge about surgery , and Group B : four experienced surgical postgraduates .
It was found that there was an apparent difference on average speed and completion time when comparing tasks from students with basic knowledge and the one from another group .
Moreover , in the task with distraction , experienced group was 1/3 - 1/2 faster in analyzing .
Even though it becomes more efficient to study with robotics ' help , uneasy operating requires much time .
Perhaps being familiar with robotics and good at operating could help out of this shortage .
Today , more people not only in the field of education , but also in different fields , have made use of robotics as tools to deepen their exploring and studying .
It is possible that the robotics would be a normal part of individual 's lives .
Mordoch et al.(2012 ) made some examples of robotics in daily lives : social human - robot , social assistive robot , therapeutic robot , mental commitment robot , care robot , robot - therapy .
To a country , robotics could be new weapons for the future technological wars .
However , there is some debate that it is against ethics to let warrior robots participate in modern wars and fight with real soldiers ( Troop , 2012 ) .
Because of its unlimited potential , robotics will be used far more widely in the future .
However , disadvantages of robotics and some social or ethical problems should be considered carefully while robotics is contributing to human 's lives .
In conclusion , with technology and computer science developing , application of robotics widens from scientific research to a variety of fields now .
Besides influences on education , robotics has an effect on medical treatment , nursing and even design to future war as well .
Even though robotics brings more beneficial consequences and advantages than its disadvantages , its shortcomings still should not be neglected and more scientific research should be done to improve application of robotics .
Is there no future for public transport ?
It directly depends on the city in which you live but , as time goes by , public transport becomes more and more necessary .
Living in a big city is always a big challenge .
You usually have to commute to work and it takes you several hours per week to get to your office .
Public transport allows you to save time and money in commuting .
Besides , it offers you spare time to read and listen to music , provided you can find a seat and have a calm trip .
Public transport is so necessary in big cities that car industry is continuously developing new means of transport .
Not only can customers choose a wide range of transport to commute , but they can also discover technologies that are not available for private purposes .
On the other hand , public transport is not so accepted in small villages , as it is not possible to offer a wide range of services and timetables .
In small cities it is easiest to travel by car .
In any case , public transport is far from having no future .
On the contrary , it should widen its goals and continue offering new services for the time being .
There are so many nice places in Russia .
They are scattered across the city .
Every place has its own distinct features .
Some places have scenic beauty in abundance while many are famous for their architectural wonders .
In addition every person has different tastes , choices and preferences .
Some people enjoy the sight of scenic beauty ; some are attracted towards places of historical and archaeological interests .
I have visited many historical and tourist places in many countries like Belgium , Great Britain , Spain and others .
But the visit which has a lasting impression on my mind is the visit of Red Square .
It is the most beautiful place I have ever seen in Moscow .
Nowhere expresses Moscow , Russia 's vast and ancient capital like Red Square .
An enormous 400 by 150 metres , Red Square lies in the centre of Moscow and on its four sides stand the Kremlin , GUM ( Department Store ) , State Historical Museum and Cathedral of the Protection of Most Holy Theotokos ( aka St. Basil 's Cathedral ) centres of government , commerce , history and religion .
The square is also home to Lenin 's tomb , a granite mausoleum to the revered founder of Socialism .
The must - see place is St. Basil 's Cathedral , the beautiful architectural symbol of Russia .
It includes domes , cupolas , arches , towers , and spires is sure to inspire you every bit as much in real life as in the photos .
At the northern end of the square you will find the State History Museum with its huge collection of artefacts charting Russia 's past right back to the stone age .
All these and many more like its cultural places , famous streets connected to square and gorges as well as old buildings make it " spirit of Moscow " .
Indeed , the beauty of Moscow is enchanting and have unique spirit .
Compare and contrast Dickens ' and the Brontë sisters ' style of writing .
The main feature of Dickens ' and the Brontë sisters ' style of writing is realism .
All these Victorian novelists use very detailed descriptions of places , people and feelings in order to make their novels as realistic as possible .
Anyway , Dickens ' style is that of sentimental realism , which mixes comedy and pathos , while the Brontë sisters ' realism is plenty of Romantic and Gothic elements and it 's widely influenced by the desolate English Moors , where they grew up .
In addition , Dickens , as long as Charlotte and Emily Brontë in some of their novels , uses quite frequently the first - person narration .
For example , in " David Copperfield " , Dickens 's most autobiographical novel , the story is talked with a first - person narration with the point of view of the protagonist as an adult .
Charlotte Brontë uses the same technique in Jane Eyre , her masterpiece .
Finally , in all cases , the stylistic choices are closely linked with the themes they deal with , which always concerned social issues .
Tennis is made of several ingredients : suspense , emotions , physical skills and training are combined with tactics and intelligence .
Athletic performance is definitely enhanced by having a fine physique and natural skills .
Nevertheless , a strong and balanced mind plays a huge role in the game of tennis , as shown by famous tennis champions , like Michael Chang and Justine Henin .
Much shorter than their fellow colleagues , they have always been able to compensate for their physical lacks with an extremely good tecnique accompanied by a strong head .
Moreover , tennis can be seen as a metaphor of life .
You are alone on the tennis court to face your contender .
It is a battle where you can count only on yourself .
Though you might be fighting for long and getting tired and tired , you have to search for the strength inside yourself to continue and reach the end of the tennis match .
Tennis also gives a message of hope .
You have never to surrender : until the last ball has bounced twice on the ground , you have to keep fighting , regardeless of the score .
Fate may play a role but you have still to try and bring out the best of yourself .
Tennis is considered a very individualistic sport .
Nonetheess , it helps to shape your own personality .
I would definitely recommend whoever would like to start this sport to approach it with a good spirit .
Although it might look difficult at the beginning , time after time you will come to realise how tennis will positively impact on your personal well - being .
Dear Chris ,
I 'm glad I finally heard from you after all this time .
It 's been a long time , so how have you been ?
And how are your wife and kids holding up ?
Anyway great to hear that you got the job you really wanted and that you enjoy it quite a lot .
I 'm pleasantly surprised by you visiting this part of the country , but let 's have fun together !
However cool to hear that you 're coming to Enschede in a month 's time !
I 'm available whenever you are so it 's an affable idea to meet up and hang out .
We could go shopping in the city centre , they have some very cool stores that we both will be able to enjoy even a Primark and I haven't seen some shops anywhere else yet .
Furthermore there is a huge and cool movie theatre where we could watch a film together , since they 've got some very exciting films coming out .
Or else there are some pubs we could visit , most of the time I quite enjoy going to a pub on the weekends myself , but it 's all up to you .
They even have a football stadium , so if you want to do that as well , let me know .
If you need a place to stay , I have a guestroom available , but that 's entirely up to you .
I hope I will hear from you soon !
Talk to you later !
Love ,
Marenka
Dear John ,
I 'm sorry it took me so long to reply .
I 've had lots of things on my head recently , especially after my mom died .
It was very considerate of you to send condolences so please , have my thanks .
It 's great to hear that you 've found the perfect job .
I 'm still looking for the one suitable for me .
Last summer I thought I found it .
It was a small job in the local cinema and my main task was to help people find their places and help them with all the food they had .
Earlier , there have been many accidents with food flying all over the place , because people tripped a lot .
When I was there , I did my job pretty well , and I quite enjoyed it .
Why ?
Because I love talking to people and spending time with them and that job gave me that opportunity .
Also the staff there was very nice and they wanted me to stay , but I needed more money so unfortunately I could n't .
I ca n't wait to hear more about your work , you seemed very excited about it .
Tell me more about the people you work with and how do you feel there ?
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
All the best ,
Daria
It was a cold night of November I was exploring a lost temple with my friend Michael , we have been looking for that temple since our teen years the temple of the silent cartographer .
The legend says that all the maps of the world are hidden into the temple protected by a guardian called Soneka the dreamer , he is an ancient warrior and his objective is to kill everyone who tries to steal the maps of the cartographer .
at the entrance of the temple were two statues the first was white and the second red , the statues were carrying a sword made of gold and diamonds those swords were used to fight Soneka and to open the gate of the cartographer , once we passed the sculptures our objective was to kill the beast and grab the map of the golden city .
Then we heard a big noise coming from inside the temple it was Soneka his appearance was glorious a big warrior using a golden armor and a big sword his skills were unmatched , he was faster than the sound our only chance was to run to the vault of the cartographer but only one can pass through the door of the cartographer Michael decide to stay out the vault I run into the cartographer and Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Since the concept and preliminary implementation model of the Yiddish Centre was developed in my office , it was expected that World ORT would participate in the project in a few capacities , rather than just including Yiddish component in our events , subject to the theme .
Some of the aspects have been discussed during my meeting with Mordechai in August .
I think that , as Robert once recommended , we should discuss the whole spectrum of our cooperation , not just the seminars , define the feasible components and have a WJC - WO MOU on such subject signed .
Please give me or David a call should you wish to discuss this further .
Nowadays , travelling by car is much more common than we could ever imagine .
And because history has a way of repeating itself I truly believe that the olden days of using public transport are making a come back .
On the one hand owning a car means independence , so that , we can travel anywhere we want , whenever we want without being tied down to a set timetable and furthermore , it is certainly more comfortable than public transport .
On the other hand , today we are forced to share a transport with other people due to economic problems that our country is facing .
People do not earn as much money as they used to , in fact they earn a lot less .
This means that people can not afford a car and all the expenses that come with it .
Therefore , even though a car is more convenient and more comfortable than any form of public transport , it is also less economical than the latter which leaves people with no other choice than to use public transport .
Hi John :
How are you doing ? I 've heard in the grapevine that you 're making a killing with your last pc program .
On the contrary , I 'm just getting used to look up every day on my computer .
I usually check my e - mail in the mornings just after having breakfast .
One good news is that finally I gave up and bought my first Smartphone .
It has turn out to be very handy .
I can answer my e - mails immediately .
It 's very handy because I read the newspapers online and for free , but only the Spanish papers .
I also like to have a look at the foreign newspapers but they only let you to read the headlines and the beginning of the article .
I always thought that the Internet was amazing , but now I even surf the web to find some solutions for my children 's homework .
The other day I found a webpage about Paris .
It 's like a blog but it 's written by many people who write there their impressions about beautiful sights .
I think it 'll be very useful for your next trip to Paris .
Well , that 's all for now I hope to hear about you soon .
Best
Javier .
1 . INTRODUCTION
The aim of this paper is to show , through a transitivity analysis of the lyrics from three different songs , how language has influenced roles of gender
The questions we are going to answer about these songs are :
• Although the performers are women , is the language used sexist ?
• Does anyone feel like a victim ?
The structure is divided in these sections :
- Method : Data selection- The three songs we will be analyzed and the reasons why we 've chose them
- Theoretical background- A review of our knowledge .
We will explain some concepts that we will use later in our analysis .
- Analysis : This part is the practical part that will answer our questions .
The lyrics will be explained .
Our tools will be transitivity analysis and language .
Furthermore , we will give some examples of clauses that represent better the meaning of our songs .
- Conclusions : The questions we made before will be answered .
With our analysis done , this final part is where the results of our work is written and we can tell the difference between these songs and what we thought at the beginning
- Bibliographical references : The part where the sources are revealed
2 . METHOD : DATA SELECTION
We are going to compare the lyrics from the following three songs : Miley Cyrus ' Wrecking Ball ; Anastasia 's Left Outside Alone ; and Taylor Swift 's Back to December .
We have chosen these three songs because they all deal with the same topic of breaking - up , but they describe this topic from different points of view , even though the three songs are performed by female singers .
These songs are relatively modern , but if we take a look we will find some sexism in some parts .
However , there 's a hope for women to find a song that does n't treat them like an inferior gender .
This is the case of the " free choice " song , Taylor Swift .
Still , women are the victim in three different ways . We will search for these situations that share the feelings of regret , made by some specific situations .
Anastasia 's song tells a story of a victim , meanwhile the others talk about women that fell guilty because they have hurted men .
Also , we think that these songs can represent different kinds of processes and language we have seen in class .
The material processes are also known as the processes of doing .
This is because they express an action or an activity .
This type of process has been found in the three songs and it is very prolific .
Usually , in these types of songs , the performers describe actions in the relationships as well as at the end of it .
The material processes are carried out by agents , which coincide with the subject .
The subject of the sentence can also be the force if the agent is inanimate .
We have found this kind of agent in the songs with the love relationship as the subject .
In this category of processes , there is another participant known as the affected , because the action of the verb affects or concerns it .
In our research , the cognition verbs have been the most common inside of the group of the mental ones followed by the affection ones , which is quite normal when describing a love relationship
SONG ANALYSIS :
The main participants are the woman and the man .
The woman uses mental and material processes the same amount of times .
Regarding mental processes , cognition is the type more used .
The material processes show some actions that the girl would like to erase because them only make emotional abuse to the man .
She feels sorry because she did not care about him in this delicate situation .
As we can see , the boy gave her love and she just want to leave him .
Although the reason for the break - up is not totally clear , the girl is saying that it was all her fault .
The boy did not do anything wrong .
If we look to the boy processes , we will find only positive things .
The processes that appears more usually are mental and relational ( attributive type ) .
These cases are always regarding good actions or showing the good characteristics of the man
.
On the other hand , the woman just say " I 'm sorry " .
The mental processes , specifically the cognition ones , tells us that she had thought a lot about what she did and that she is wrong .
The other participants appears a few times , but these participants tell us important things about the relationship .
She cares about him , about his life and his family ( even though she did n't care before ) .
Consequently , these participants give us some keys to understand better the situation , but actually they just confirm what the girl feels .
She is regreting because their relationship get worse and it was n't what she supposed it could be .
She wants him , but " the chain is on his door " .
She broke up , but now she is on his hands .
This can only be explained because he is a good boy and she was ( probably ) confused .
Although now she is sure , she had suffered a lot . " The cold " and " the fear " was inside her .
She feels bad , but she does n't really know what to say .
Even though , there 's a sentence that can confuse anyone .
She says " swallowing my pride " .
She has to do it , and is a sacrifice .
Maybe she feels bad , but not completely guilty .
This sentence shows a girl who thinks she is not really bad , though she knows she could have done things better .
Obviously , she ca n't say a bad thing about him , but we do n't really know what he thinks about her .
There are some clues in sentences like " Your guard is up " or " the last time you saw me is still burning in the back of your mind " .
This means he still loves her , but at the same time he 's still hurt .
He is confusedly in love .
Finally , the woman tells him that she would understand that he does n't want to restart the relationship , but she makes a promise :
" If we loved again , I swear I 'd love you right " .
The problem is that maybe is too late and she only can wish " I 'd realized what I had when you were mine " .
This sentence and some others sound like if they were pronounced by a man …
Learning a new language is always an exciting experience .
There could be many reasons that lead to the need to learn new languages but , the advantages are vast .
Learning a new language gives you a chance to see the many things that are around you in a different aspect .
You will thus broaden your way of thinking and in the end as you learn you will enhance your intelligence .
However , you need to understand that learning a new language is not an easy task .
You need to invest your time and energy in it so as to achieve results .
There is a lot of stress associated with it , bearing in mind that in most cases a new language will revolve around a culture that is different from what you are used to .
Enthusiasm to learn is all that you will need so as to get the first few steps done .
After the first few words , you will like the experience and will be hard for you to stop .
It is always interesting to communicate with natives of a foreign language comfortably .
The most important thing is to have positive thoughts .
You may find the first initial stages of real stress .
You may even feel like giving up .
Encouraging yourself that you can work perfectly well for you .
To speed up the learning process , you need to read many comic books in the language that want to learn . I will be hard to understand everything that you read but the pictures in the comic books will help you .
In time , you will get to learn many new words .
You also need to choose books of your favorite authors .
This is important because you understand their way of writing and will be easy to understand . Enrolling in different forums that are in the language you want to learn will be of great aid to you .
However , you need to choose forums with eloquent speakers as it is the only way you will gain much .
Hey John !
How are things going over there ?
Is Ms. Gretchen still giving you trouble ?
Have you made any progress on your website project ?
I 've been very busy lately .
I 've got a lot of assignments to work on .
And this depressing weather is just making the situation worse .
Anyway , I was thinking maybe you can help me out with this latest one . I 'm supposed to do some research on eating customs around the world and I figured , instead of just doing a quick search on Google and grabbing something off a Wikipedia article , I 'd ask you for a more direct source of input on the habits of the English .
If I quote you on my work , I might score a few extra marks .
So , what 's the typical English approach to nutritional needs ?
Waiting to hear back from you ,
Your friend Hugo .
Proposal for the development of a sports activity .
Introduction
Sports are all around the community .
They improve our health and help people interact with each other .
Those are a few reasons why it is important for us as a healthy group of people to have facilities in which we can practice this kind of activities .
The chosen one
In my opinión running is one of the most helpful sports when it comes to start moving and getting fit , in particular for those people who have not been doing any kind of physical activity for a long time .
This activity would not demand huge amounts of money to be done and with a non - significant investment would help a large group of people who desperately need it .
Minimal investment with huge benefits
To start running this community will need a few things .
To begin with , it is important that the government develops a program which creates social awareness .
A significant part of the population in this town do not know the importance of practising sports and having a healthier life .
Once people know all the benefits this sport has , they will need a space where to practice it comfortably .
With this in mind money would be spent on constructing a running rute where no - one would have to worry about traffic or obstacules in their way .
Benefit for all ages
There are almost no contraindications to practise this sport so almost everybody in the town has the opportunity to try it at least once .
This activity not only improves your body and health but also helps you have positive thoughts making everyone feel happier .
Conclusión
In my opinion improving the practice of this sport will be a great investment for our community and will have a great impact on our health and in our everyday lives .
The lecture and the reading passage both discuss how to stop the spread of cane toads in Australia .
However , the lecturer argues against the reading passage .
The reading passage mentions three ways to prevent cane toads from spreading , while the speaker offers three reasons to refutes the reading passage .
The first point , suggested by the lecturer , is that national fence can not stop cane toads from spreading .
The cane toads ' eggs and young cane toads can spread to other areas from the streams and rivers .
Unless the national fence can prevent the eggs and young can toads from moving through the water way , the fence is useless .
Thus , the lecture disputes the idea mentioned in the article that building a national fence could avoid the spreading .
The lecturer 's second argument invovles capturing and destroying the toads by volunteers .
It is argued in the listening passage that untrained volunteers could harm the native frogs which are endangered .
Because the young frogs look alike , it is possible that the volunteers will kill frogs other than cane toads .
In short , the lecturer questions what is stated in the reading passage that prevent the spreading by volunteers capturing the cane toads .
Finally , it is argued in the listening passage that disease - causing virus that killed the toads could be a disaster .
The lecturer says that if the virus was bring to the original habitats of cane toads in South America , it will cause ecological damage to the local ecosystem . To sum up , the lecturer doubts the way mentioned in the reading that specially designed virus could specifically harm cane toads and prevent them from spreading .
To conclude , the lecturer discords with the ideas in the passage by presenting three convincing reasons .
National fence , volunteers , and virus are not good solutions to the cane toads spreading problem .
" Mission : Impossible " soars again with stunning five outing !
It it hard to believe that Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise is still able to reinvent himself carry the weight of a blockbuster franchise like the " Mission : Impossible " series , much more so after considering the fact that he is now in his early fifties , and still looks as fresh as he did in the 25 years old " Days of Thunder " .
To start , " Rogue Nation " follows the same basic formula of the movies preceding it : fast - paced action , a focus on the espionage and gadgetry of the core team , and some of the most breathtaking set pieces Hollywood has to offer .
Together with a solid foe and the deft and stylish hand of director Christopher McQuarrie , all elements combine to give this fifth outing a refined sense of urgency , perfecting the pace to deliver constant , ever - topping thrills .
Finally , a special mention goes for Joe Kraemer 's superbly thrilling score , just a masterclass of old - school , kickass orchestral action music .
With all things considered , the bottom line is that Cruise & Co have delivered what has to be considered as the finest film in the series yet .
The social debate between progress and traditions has been going on for centuries .
Through our customs , we celebrate our past and keep our cultural heritage alive .
But it is also because of these set of beliefs , mostly of religious origins , that some societies fail to evolve and respond to the ever - changing needs of all of their people .
One of the main advantages of cutural practices is that they allow societies to maintain their identities and gain economic stability .
In most Latin American countries , millenary practices such as silversmithing , not only keep the region in touch with its heritage , but they have become the sole source of income for many communities .
Nations like Mexico and Peru , with internationally recognized cuisines , have taken advantage of their culinary roots and boosted the production of locally grown foods , like chipotle peppers and quinoa , to bring economic growth to their agriculture sectors .
On the other hand , the greatest disadvantage of traditions , is that religious beliefs have kept these very same populations from social and human rights progress .
Gay marriage and reproductive rights are not recognized by the Costa Rican and most Latin governments , all because of the set of beliefs of a percentage of their community .
In conclusion , traditions should be cherished and kept alive for future generations .
However , the safekeeping of these practices should never become a priority over the wellbeing of the collective .
Progress and traditions are not opposites in a socie ty were respect and tolerance for others is the priority .

" Prison has long been the traditional punishment for people who commit crimes .
Some people believe , however , that community service orders are more appropriate in some cases .
When do you think that it is right to order people to work in the community to pay for their crimes ? "
In recent years , the most common punishment for criminals has been prison .
There are certain people who believe community service orders are more adequate in some cases .
People who break the law , should be ordered to work in community in order to pay for their misdeeds , when they have done a minor offence or if they have acted unintentionally .
Community service orders are more appropriate than prison punishments when people have acted unintentionally .
Sending criminals to prison is a serious verdict for people that have made a mistake .
Nobody is sinless and people should not be treated as serious as being sent to jail .
For example , graffiti makers in Bulgaria are sent to prison for 4 years .
This is unfair , because they do not do any harm to the environment nor to the society .
It is better that they do a certain amount of community work , for example clean their graffiti , which will teach them how hard it is to clean graffiti , and thus , prevent them from making new ones .
Working in the community is more adequate compared to sending people to prison when criminals have done a minor offence .
Limiting people 's freedom because of minor , non - harmful to the society crimes is inhumane .
Everybody deserves freedom , despite its crimes .
Although their misdeeds should not be tolerated , I believe that had better do some community work .
This will help them understand their mistakes and prevent them in future .
For example , in Bulgaria , people who lay down and relax on the grass in the park are sent to jail for 6 years , because they are considered " doing serious damage to the environment and preventing the park from further development " .
Community service orders should be used when people have acted unintentionally and when they have conceded a minor offence , as this will help them realize their mistakes , without them being limited in freedom by being sent to prison .
This will help them realize their mistakes and thus , quit doing them .
House at the End of the Street
The last movie I watched was House Next Door , a captivating thriller that stars Jennifer Lawrence , Elizabeth Shue and Mark Thieriot .
The plot is about a teenage girl who moves in with her mother to their dream house , which was next to a home where a horrible double homicide had taken place in .
As soon as they move in , they hear the rumors of the incident : a little girl brutally murdered her parents in the middle of the night and disappeared , and the other child of the family recently moved in there .
As the movie develops , it has lots of interesting turns that let the viewer form his / her own conclusions .
I myself am a fan of horror movies , which are highly predictable , so it was a great satisfaction to see such a complex film .
The end completely blew me away and I believe it was the best part of it .
The acting was smooth and credible .
Although it had bad critics , the movie was well received by the audience ; not to mention Jennifer Lawrence 's appearance right after the hit of Hunger Games was great for advertising .
In conclusion , I highly recommend this film for those who like drama and plot twists .
Actually I intend to study law but since there is no ' law ' in the subject choices so I chose economics .
I think that a law degree is such a practical degree and legal knowledge is applicable almost everywhere .
I chose to study law because I think that law is very important in our society .
Without law , this world that we are living in will not be in order and peace , but in chaos .
I believe that every human , organization and company has their own rights and it is in my duty to use my legal knowledge to help them from infringement of their rights .
My study plan is to untertake a pre - university programme locally to prepare myself for further studies overseas .
I aspire to further my studies in Law at the University of Cambridge .
I would love to be in an intellectually stimulating environment , being surrounded by the brightest young minds from all over the world .
In my opinion , the exchange of thoughts and views between all these brilliant people is exactly where a totally new and creative idea will spark .
Almost every home , office or school has a computer of some kind these days .
Many people feel that these machines are now an essential part of our lives , but how necessary are they really ?
One of the main advantages is the time that can be saved by using a computer .
This is especially beneficial in the workplace , where employees can do their work far faster than they could in the past .
In addition to this , computers can be educational and fun .
From a very young age children can gain basic computer skills through programmes that allow them to learn , draw , paint and play .
In today 's technological world , this knowledge can only help them in the future .
However , there are various negative aspects to using com - puters .
Many jobs have been lost due to the fact that computers can do a lot of tasks more efficiently than humans .
This has led to high unemployment in many countries .
What is more , computers can actually cause health problems .
Endless hours in front of a screen can cause eye strain and headaches , which are serious side - effects .
To sum up , it seems that computers are a useful addition to our fast - moving world of high technology .
However , it must be remembered that they are here to serve us - not to replace us .
Social networking is a tool used by people all around the world .
Its purpose is to promote and aid communication .
However I think that this type of technology might be doing more harm than good .
It is not only changing how we communicate , but how we interact with each other in daily life .
All social networks have their own pros and cons but certainly there are some social networks that affect more than others .
In conclusion I can say that the social network that affects population the most is Facebook .
It may be on the verge of replacing traditional personal interactions for the next generation .
It affects our lives in many ways , including our communication , self- expression , bullying , isolations , friendships , and even our very own sense of humanity .
On this networking site , users create pages that represent them in some way .
They post pictures of themselves and their friends .
Facebook has more bad effects in adolescents than in adults , they are known to be more mature about what they post and how they interact online .
It is more likely that adults would , use their profile pictures as a way of casually showing themselves , their family , find new clients for their jobs or possibly a recent trip they took .
Teenagers , however , use this technology in a way that could be dangerous .
In this stage of their lives , they care more about their need to impress their peers than mature reasoning .
Comments that are left on their pages mean more to them than words said face to face
Adults need to teach teenagers the importance of not abuse from using social networks , specially Facebook .
Teachers at school may improve more restrictions that make teenagers avoid using social networks in an extremely way .
At work , bosses may reduce employee 's salaries if their job gets affected because of distractions that are produced by social networks .
Proposal to improve School 's facilities for language learners .
Introduction :
The aim of this proposal is to make recommendations in order to improve the school facilities .
Aspects such as space , internet access and materials will be discussed in order to make suggestions to improve the service for students learning languages .
First , an inspection to the school 's facilities was organised , in order to assess the school premises .
From the visit , it was concluded that even if the majority of students express satisfaction with the space , some of them wish to have more classrooms that allow a more reasonable number of students per class .
Currently , each class is given to 50 students which limits their opportunities to experience one o one activities that enhance their learning process .
It would be advisable to accommodate classes in the main building that offers enough space for smaller classes .
Secondly , It was surprising to evidence an absence of Internet access in the computer room .
Even if the room counts with a considerable number of computers , the absence of Internet does not give students the opportunity to use the many websites useful to improve their language skills .
Therefore , I strongly recommend guaranteeing internet access which does not represent a high cost for the academic board .
The access will give learners the possibility to use technological tools that will ensure a better experience while learning languages .
Finally , authentic material in foreign languages was not found in the school 's library .
It is crucial to provide students with printed material in the target language .
Magazines and newspapers allow learners to have direct contact with language in real contexts .
Thus , I suggest to make subscriptions to international magazines in order to enrich the school 's library .
Conclusion .
I strongly believe that if the suggestions made in this proposal are given attention , the service provided to language learners will be strengthen and enhanced .
I felt a deep sense of self - hatred and guilt !
How could I cut the rope ?
How would the entire world in general and the mountaineering fraternity in particular , judge my decision ?
I must be prepared to abase myself in front of the whole world from now !
I needed to survive in light of the fact that it was impossible to haul Joe up to safety .
I could have been pulled over the snowy cliff by Joe 's fall , in my effort to pull him up instead .
I was not to blame for him having injured his leg .
I tried to justify my own horrible action .
I needed some consolation to return to a state of psychological normalcy ; it was a step towards survival .
Picking myself up slowly after the numbness around my waist and hip had subsided ; I knew I had little time to apportion blame to Joe or myself .
After all , we were in a team in search of personal glory to be the first to ever climb the west face of this Andes mountain !
I had to look to help ; there was little time to lose .
Perhaps there was every chance that Joe could have survived the fall !
Only God knows !
So I began to pray in earnest .
I felt strong enough to move about , looking for my compass and map in the rucksack on my back .
Ever since I started learning English I have found quite handy watching TV series , especially those which are perfectly subtitled , in order to follow the plot properly .
In fact , it is quite useful if you are actually interested in improving your skills , when it comes to listening and speaking .
On the other hand , I have been in search of the series which catches my attention and it took me very long until I finally put my finger on it .
The TV series known as Downton Abbey is the best I have ever seen , and in the following lines I would like to explain why .
It is set in England during and after the First World War .
The whole plot takes place in the area called Downton , the castle of Earl Lord Gratham , his family and the service staff .
Although the story is focused on the Lord 's family , the service has an important part to play , as the world is changing continuously and the nobility is getting old - fashioned .
The main point in this series is that every character has been absolutely developed , with its own characteristics and personalities .
Even the background is cleverly chosen what enhances the intriguing and dramatic script .
Needless to say , the actors are sublime and they give their touch to their role , especially Maggie Smith , which is one of my favourite actress .
Because of all these reasons , I highly recommend taking into account Downton Abbey to be included in your top ten list .
I wish to apply for the Assistants & management support for the " Asset Allocation & Macro Research " ( AA&MR ) position as I believe it is in perfect alignment with my skills and professional experience .
My penultimate position was as chief executive of a company with photocomposition , which was followed by the creation of a publication service serving the " Sell Side " department of Pictet , then Helvea demonstrated my sense of organization and easy adaptation to new environment .
My goal has always been to combine speed with quality , using good organization skills and an excellent mastery of different technological tools .
I possess very good knowledge of page layout software .
Furthermore , I am fluent in English language , with good writing skills .
Conscientious by nature , I always strive to be thorough in my work , to be diligent , and consistently completing my tasks .
In addition , I am a team player with good interpersonal skills .
I would be glad to further expand upon what I can offer in an interview .
Yours faithfully ,
NB : In addition , in the case of employment , I would receive an allowance of a participation of 50% of the salary for a period of two years .
Dear Jo ,
It 's so nice to hear from you and I 'm so happy that you are coming to Egypt this summer .
Well , first of all , there are a lot of activities you can do for fun , such as visiting some historical places that are attractive for many tourists .
Since you are coming in summer , you should visit Sharm or Hurghada for some sea activities like swimming , diving and snorkeling .
About work , since you are a native speaker of English language and you have and idea about teaching English as a second language , you can apply for teaching centers that offer jobs for native - speakers of English language .
They will pay you a reasonable salary .
And it will be good preparation for your study at college .
I hope to hear from you soon .
Best wishes ,
Christina ,

I admit that I do n't really enjoy soap operas .
However , I live in Brazil and there is no way out when it comes to soap operas .
Brazilian people are known for their creativity and enthusiasm for soap operas .
The success of the soap opera depends on the theme , the people have to weather to relate to it or have interest on it .
As a typical Brazilian I have a favorite soap opera , is called Floribella .
The story is about a poor girl called Floribella she is an eccentric seamstress , she has amazing friend and they have a band together .
She starts to work for Mister Frederico , a young and wealthy man who has three brothers to take care .
He is arrogant but Flor is the only one who can calm him down in difficult situations .
She falls in love with him , but unfortunately he is engaged and his fiancée is an awful person who always try to humiliate Flor .
I 'm afraid to say that this soap opera does n't have a happy end and I did n't enjoy the end either , but I still recommend it because it 's a beautiful love story and the characters are really amusing and the story is funny and lovely .
Despite its end and all others odds that it may have , I 'm still a big fan of Floribella and I ca n't wait to watch it again on Netflix .
You should watch it too , so we can discuss it together .
And by the way , the soundtracks are awesome , you 'll be addicted to them .
Taking care of environment has become an essential need in our daily life .
Countries , states , cities and even municipalities are focusing on how to include green plans in their future work plans .
Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR ) is indicated in more than 90% of missions statements around the world .
Saying that taking care of the environment is not only the concern of citizens but also the national and international organizations .
As for my city , the mayor gives environment his top priority and a budgeted plan under the process of implementation .
awareness sessions have been made to explain the difference among re - use , recycle and reduce .
a different color trash bags were distributed to citizens to be used at home to separate the trash according to each material .
In addition to that , a law has been enforced to plant a tree in front of each building .
Also , Films on soaring birds were played to explain the importance of birds in cleaning the atmosphere .
It is worth to mention that schools are considering Environment subject is part of the education sytem that should be taught to students .
Finally , I 'm proud to say that taking care of the environment is part of my and my family daily life .
Trash distribution , using green products that repect the ozone layer , not wasting water and many other actions .
I am writing to apply for the position of assistant professor of English with an emphasis in nineteenth - century American literature that you advertised in the February 20XX MLA Job Information List .
I am a Dean 's Fellow and Ph.D. candidate at XYZ University , currently revising the final chapter of my dissertation , and expecting to graduate in May 20XX .
I am confident that my teaching experience and my research interests make me an ideal candidate for your open position .
Over the past five years , I have taught a variety English courses .
I have taught a number of American literature survey courses , as well as writing courses , including technical writing and first - year writing .
I have extensive experience working with ESL students , as well as students with a variety of learning disabilities , including dyslexia and dysgraphia , and disabilities like ADD and ADHD .
I pride myself in creating a classroom environment that accommodates the needs of my individual students while still promoting a high level of critical thought and writing skills .
Some of my most satisfying experiences as a teacher have come from helping struggling students to grasp difficult concepts , through a combination of individual conferences , class activities , and group discussion .
I know I would thrive as a teacher in your college , due to your belief in small classroom size and individualized support for students .
Not only does my teaching experience suit the needs of your school and department , but my research interests also fit perfectly with your description of the ideal candidate .
My dissertation project , " Ferns and Leaves : Nineteenth - Century Female Authorial Space , " examines the rise and development of American female authors in the 1840s and 1850s , with a particular focus on patterns of magazine publication .
I argue that , rather than being submissive to the requirements of the editor or publisher , female authors in fact developed a more transparently reciprocal relationship between themselves and their readers than previously has been assumed .
I apply recent print - culture and book - history theory to my readings of novels , magazine articles , letters , and diary entries by various female authors , with a particularly focus on Sara Willis ( known by her pseudonym Fanny Fern ) .
I plan to develop my dissertation into a book manuscript , and continue to research the role of female writers in antebellum magazine culture , with a particular focus on the rise and influence of female magazine editors on literary culture .
My research interests have both shaped and been shaped by my recent teaching experiences .
Last spring , I developed and taught a course on the history of print culture in America .
I combined readings on theory and literature that addressed issues of print with visits to local historical museums and archives .
My students conducted in - depth studies on particular texts ( magazines , newspapers , novels ) for their final papers .
I believe my interdisciplinary teaching style , particularly my emphasis on material culture , would fit in well with the interdisciplinary nature of your English department .
I am therefore confident that my teaching experience , my skill in working with ESL and LD students , and my research interests all make me an excellent candidate for the assistant professor of English position at ABC College .
I have attached my curriculum vitae and the two requested sample publications .
I would be happy to send you any additional materials such as letters of reference , teaching evaluations , and past and proposed course syllabi . I will be available to meet with you at either the MLA or C19 conference , or anywhere else at your convenience .
Thank you so much for your consideration ; I look forward to hearing from you .
Not so long ago I watched film called " 47 Ronin " .
The action takes place in Japan , in times of samurais and witches .
The main hero is a mysterious stranger , betrayed by everyone , sold into slavery , chosen by fate to administer revenge , will become one of 47 warriors that defy death .
Appearing from another world he will rise up against the darkness to protect his forbidden love .
I liked this film because of many things , but most of all I liked the costumes .
They were very different and very colorful , but at the same time corresponded with the time period of the film .
With this film , I was able to get a clear idea about traditions and customs of that time .
I also liked the plot built on a base of a Japanese legend .
And I just could n't forget to mention beautiful decorations and realistic special effects .
I think other people will like it as much as I did , because it is a very interesting and exciting story about true love that lives through time and space , and about real friendship and loyalty .
A transportation vehicle that has changed people 's live .
That transportation exerts a far - reaching influence on people 's daily routines and lifestyle is true .
Not only that , what prides itself as the most influential vehicle - as most public recognized - is the automobile .
There are people who have never ridden a bicycle , and people who have never been on an airplane but it would be hard to find a person who has never been in a car .
It is generally believed that the invention of car leads to the dispersion of the population out of urban centers , to the growth of the suburbs .
Prior to the automobile , is the horse and wagon life , it is not feasible for people to live far from their place of work .
The growth of the suburbs changed the face of American society , bringing with it a whole different way of life .
Moreover , it leads to an important expansion in commerce , resulting in the growth of the ubiquitous shopping malls , department stores , serving as a powerful pull to tourism .
What greatly increased mobility leads to significant changes , additionally , lies in various lifestyles .
Being able to live far from one 's workplace , people could travel far and wide for pleasure and indulge themselves in a remarkable trip .
It may be for a day , a week , or a period of time .
In the urban city , the car is by far the most common mode of transportation and has greatly impacted the growth of the tourist industry .
We are beginning to see people in countries with cars going out of the city on weekends and holidays .
Though being good enough , yet the growth of population and mobility do not tell the whole story .
This powerful vehicle is counted vital for another reason : being an indispensable factor in many aspects .
It is the key that supports many industrial fields , such as steel , machinery , plastic .
The whole business success would not have met perfection without the help of transportation to distribute their materials and commodities well .
Last but not least , the booming prosperity often parallels the numbers of job in the city .
Although other forms of transportation may be more comfortable , none has changed the way we do business and live our lives more than the car .
Thanks to the speed , excitement , and convenience of the cars , our lives are enriched .
Travelling to Japan through food !
The newest Japanese restaurant in town - Ohana restaurant is the place to be on a Friday night .
Its atmosphere is that of an old Buddhist temple situated on a mountain somewhere in Japan .
The staff 's clothes are beautifully coloured and believe it or not , all of them are Japanese and can speak English fluently .
The moment you pass the huge wooden doors , the music sets you back in Meiji Era and you feel like you are about to meet a very important samurai .
What made it a success was the menu and the wide variety of Japanese food .
What I particularly appreciated was that you can sit around the chefs and watch them prepare the food .
It 's really delicious !
Unfortunately , the music was a bit too loud for my taste .
After eight o'clock , a professional band of musicians start playing traditional Japanese music and it can be a bit loud .
They need to focus on that a bit more .
However , overall I think that this new restaurant has the potential of becoming very popular in a short time due to the food and the great atmosphere .
The staff is also very friendly .
You really should go and try this amazing restaurant at the first opportunity .
I fully intend to go the next time I have the chance and try the Hokkaido Natto .
JOb and social life both play important roles to put people 's lives together .
Some people tend to think that their jobs have more effect on their happiness , while others seem to believe that their social life has more of an influence .
In my opinion , my social interaction balances my life more than does my working experience .
As a result , I believe that my social life has more of an effect on my happiness .
There are several reasons to support my position .
First of all , family and friends whom we love always offer their support to comfort us .
With the increasing competition in the workplace , people bear more and more stress .
The companionship of our loved people is always the best solution to release our pressure .
For example , every day it seems that an extremely tight deadline is always chasing after me , and makes me breathless .
Meanwhile , I always feel exhausted and barely have any energy to talk with anyone after a long day from the work .
However , I always can recover my energy after having a little nice chat with my family or friends .
Therefore , the happiness brought from my social connections helps to alleviate the stress related to work .
In addition , attending social activities widens my life 's experiences wholesomely .
Take my yoga class for example .
Since I joined the yoga studio , I have made a lot of new friends .
Besides yoga , most of them also have numerous other interests , like hiking , jogging , and baking .
Meanwhile , they are friendly and willing to share their knowledge with me .
Both learning new knowledge and making new friends make me feel delighted .
Therefore , an active social life not only benefits my mental health but also keep me in a good mood .
Lastly , some people may think that co - workers naturally melt into our social life since we spend so much time in the workplace .
This might suggest that being surrounded by people at work with whom we need to socialize would have more of an effect on our emotions .
However , most of the time people keep a good relationship with their co - workers in order to accomplish their common task harmoniously .
On the other hand , people are willing to discuss serious matters with their family and friends because of their shared bond of trust .
For example , we talk about something trivial , such as gripes , and gossip , with our colleagues .
Conversely , we share our deepest worries and problems with our close family and friends because we are not afraid of exposing our weakness to those people whom we trust .
At the same time , we will also pay more attention to the people whom we love .
Therefore , the more deeply our emotions interact , the more tremendously our happiness is influenced .
In conclusion , because of intimate support , growth in life experiences , and emotional interaction , I agree with the statement that the social life has more of an effect on my happiness than does my occupation .
In other words , even though I can get temporary happiness from accomplishing a work task or gaining a compliment from my co - workers , personally I think I obtain more permanent enjoyment and satisfaction from engaging and interacting with the people that I love .
As a result , I believe that my social life influences my personal happiness more than does my job .
A balancing act
The doorbell rang .
When I opened the door imagine my surprise ... There was a large box standing in front of the door , addressed to me , while I had never received packages before !
The only post ever sent to me was an anniversary card , sent by my grandmother before she passed away .
Still a bit surprised , I grabbed the box up , which proved to be no picnic , as it felt as if it had been filled with rocks .
Nonetheless , I managed to remove the box from the ground and staggered through the doorway , in the direction of the living room .
While walking , I paid all my attention to carrying the box .
If only I had looked a bit better where I placed my feet ...
Anyway , I did n't notice the skateboard which lay in front of my feet .
When I stepped on it , I lost my balance and the box fell on the ground .
I heard the sound of breaking glass .
Immediately , I opened the box and found a short letter , saying : " Dear Jane , here 's the inheritance from your grandmother : her glass tea service ... "
There is no doubt that travelling by car is the most comfortable option , but claiming that public transport has no future is too much .
Many people use public transport on a daily basis .
There are people who would n't be able to travel if it was n't for public transport .
Children and elders ca n't have a driving license , so if they need to go somewhere , using public transport is their only option .
Travelling by car is also very detrimental for the environment .
In big cities , the air is very polluted because there are too many cars . Travelling by public transport lowers the impact on the environment , something that most people are aware of , but still they prefer to use their own vehicle .
Using public transport can also save time , since you do n't have to spend time looking for a place to park your car .
I definitely think that public transport will continue to be very important in the future .
In general , shopping is associated with something pleasant , but unfortunately this is not always true .
There are some reasons why people leave shop in a bad mood , or even do n't want to get in them .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
For some people , shopping is one of their obligations .
For others it is overall a pleasant experience they can not enjoy as much as they would like .
Firstly , shopping may be uncomfortable , because more often than not we can hear there tiring music , saleswomen can be too intrusive and the queue usually are very long .
Sometimes women go to the store , just to watch the new stuff , to look around and questions asked by sellers make us angry .
In addition , shopping is also a problem for men .
It is said that the man , who go shopping more than one hour is angry and tired .
Sometimes it is also a trouble for women , who want to go shopping with her partner .
To sum up , doing shopping is inevitable , so we can make everyday shopping more enjoyable .
For exapmle , we can take at least one family member with us .
This is a great opportunity to spend some quality time together , exchange ideas and opinions ; opt for evening shopping , specifically about half an hour before the stores close if you want to avoid big crowds ; if possible , choose only one store for your everyday shopping .
Going from one store to another can waste your time , cost you a lot in gas , as well as mentally and physically exhaust you ; when it comes to products that your regularly use , buying in bulk is the best option you have , since that way you get a bigger quantity for a lower price ; or just choose online shopping - is a great way to make your purchases from the comfort of your own home , without having to go out on a rainy day , deal with noisy ( and sometimes even smelly ) crowds , spend money on gas and wait in huge lines .
First of all I would like to begin with giving some information about the city where the place that you will be visiting belongs to .
The city of Istanbul is one of the famous and crowded cities of Turkey which constitutes the country 's economic , cultural , and historical heart .
The population of Istanbul is over 20 million and Istanbul is among the largest cities in the world by population within city limits .
Historical Peninsula is the centre of ancient Istanbul where the four major empires had been ruled from .
There are many historical places in the Historical Peninsula such as mosques , churches and palaces .
The most important ones are Hagia Sophia , Topkapi Palace , Sultanahmet Mosque , Suleymaniye Mosque , Yeni Mosque , the Grand Bazaar , Basilica Cistern , Beyazit Tower and the Spice Bazaar .
In order to give brief information on them I would like to touch on some of them .
Hagia Sophia was built as a cathedral in 537 , converted to a mosque after the conquest of Istanbul , now is being used as a museum .
Topkapi Palace was built in 1470 's and Ottoman Empire was ruled from this palace for 380 years .
The Grand Bazaar is one of the largest covered markets in the world and it has more than 4,000 shops .
It is well known for its jewellery , pottery , spice , leather and carpet shops .
Basilica Cistern was built in the 6th century and is the largest of several hundred ancient cisterns that still lie beneath the city of Istanbul ; size of 143 by 65 meters , with capacity of holding 80,000 cubical meters of water .
Beyazit Tower is 85 meter located in the courtyard of Istanbul University 's main campus in Beyazıt Square .
The Spice Bazaar is the second largest covered bazaar after the Grand Bazaar .
It stands next to Yeni Mosque .
You can find many types of spices , herbs , nuts , Turkish delight , etc .
Actually I was asked to recommend only one place , but Historical Peninsula is already an area where those historical distincts got together .
I hope the given information is useful for you .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing in regard to some important documents I left in your hotel room during my stay .
Last week , I joined the C&A meeting as one of the major speakers .
The following conversation was so engaging that I forgot the time and , as a result I got late for my departure to Chicago .
In my hurry , I forgot to collect a few critical documents .
I am not completely certain , but I remember that the last time I kept them was near the tiny blue table located at the left corner of the room .
I am contacting you because those papers are sensitive to my company .
Therefore , I need those papers .
As you can imagine , they are confidential and they should be handled with caution .
I feel extremely worried not to have picked them up . I would be very grateful if you could have a look in the room .
If you found them , could you send them to my office by post ?
I am willing to pay for postal charges .
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours faithfully ,
John X.
Everybody has goals that they want to achieve .
Having goals in life will make ones ' life meaningful and purposeful .
As for my dreams for the upcoming years , I think I have two dreams in life that I will do my best and try hard to realize .
They are studying in an English university abroad and becoming a programmer .
First , I want to attend an English university abroad .
Being able to study in an English university will give me the opportunity to get a better job and an exciting experience .
As we all know , nowadays , English proficiency is on the list of the required skills to be employed and the market highly demands it .
Secondly , the experiences one gets from a multicultural medium is very valuable and makes one more matured .
and I feel that only an overseas English university can offer that .
Second , I want to be employed as a programmer .
there are many reasons why I want to be a programmer .
primarily , because being a developer is my dream job and secondly because developers make a lot of money .
I wanted to be a programmer since I was 14 years old .
I was fascinated by this field of science .
In addition , earning a fair amount of money is essential to building my life .
For example , if I want to marry in the future , I have to be able to send my kids to a decent school and provide them with what they want . not to mention wedding party expenses .
To sum it up , graduating from an English university and then becoming a programmer are currently my mine aims .
Having a good job and a high salary will make my life richer and more awarding .
With the advent of individually owned vehicles like the car , an individual 's dependence on public transport has certainly reduced .
However , with that being said , in my opinion , there is still a lot of future for public transport .
I 'd like to highlight the factors that would support my opinion in a certain order that pertains to a wider acceptance .
First of all , from a cost perspective , public transport is much cheaper compared to a car , especially when a cost reduction concept like ' car pooling ' is not followed .
The financial benefit that public transport gives to the common man is second to none , especially in common situations like long distance commutes for daily work .
In addition , from a ' time savings ' angle , increased usage of public transport results in reducing traffic and helping people reach their destinations quicker by avoiding being delayed in traffic jams and lights .
From an environmental standpoint , use of public transport ensures that carbon emissions from automobiles are prevented helping in preserving the balance of nature even in big cities like Tokyo and Delhi where the carbon emissions are very high .
Modern TV is worth every pound
Cookery programmes , films , documentaries , talkshows … It 's clear that there are lots of different programmes on TV nowadays .
Maybe you think of television as a waste of money .
In that case , I can guarantee you that today 's telly is definitely worth the money .
It 's true that there are lots of repeats on TV and there may be many programmes you regard as poor quality .
However , there 's always a channel that sends out a new episode .
Besides that , it 's very likely that you can find some programmes you like between all the trash because of the wide variety .
In addition , the price of watching television for a whole month is much lower than the price of tickets for the cinema to watch a film for only two hours .
Moreover , when you sit in front of the TV in your own house , you wo n't get irritated by strangers , which may happen in the cinema .
In my opinion , TV provides something for everyone 's taste nowadays , including good quality programmes , for a reasonable price .
It should be possible for everyone to enjoy watching television !

Today i want to talk with you about the process of making bank notes .
We use cash everyday and it is of great importance to our daily life .
Also , we need to know how it is made .
Firstly , something about designing must be taken into consideration .
Not only the background colour but also the artwork we need to choose .
Apart from that , we also need to design security issues .
Secondly , we have to do some preparation of metal plates .
After that , we now need to print it out .
A sheet includes 50 bank notes .
Every bank note should be coloured both sides and we even need to use special ink in case of been copied .
Finally , after being printed , every bank note needs to be manually inspected .
Some good quality sheets will be packaged and distributed to the market but the bad sheets would be disposaled .
Maybe there would be some partially damaged sheets so the bank notes will be separated into good and bad .
The main features of these bank notes are good quality and effort made by bank workers .
So do n't look down on the bank notes in your hand now , they are precious .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
The day before , he and his two best friends , Louis and Lucas , were playing football near the police station , when Louis and Lucas started arguing with eachoder .
It went out of control and they started fighting .
Peter tryed to stop them but it was impossible , so he tried to find somebody to separate them .
He did n't found anyone so he grabbed Louis and tried to calm them down .
Lucas wanted to apologise and forget what happened but Louis was really hungry , so Lucasdecided to go home .
Peter let go of Louis because he thought that it was safe , but Louis caught the ball and tried to hit Lucas .
The ball went straight the police station window and broke the glass .
Peter got so scared that ran away .
Louis got caught and told the cops that Lucas was the one that had broke it .
The police went to school to talk with Lucas and try to find a fare punishment .
Peter knew that Lucas was n't guilty but he and Louis were best friends since the elementary school , he had to do his decision and he only had two minutes until they took Lucas to the police station .
Peter got up and told the cops what really happened , Louis tried to excuse himself but it was too late .
Louis had to pay the window and also clean the school 's canteen for two months , but he realized that what he did was wrong so he apologised to Lucas .
They decided to forget what happened and stay friends .
The end .
She went into the " reading room " where there were thousands of books and she hid between two huge bookcases .
It seemed that the man in the wheelchair was looking for something but suddenly , he took a couple of books and put into a hidden pocket in his wheelchair .
Quickly , Angie ran to the store detective to tell him what she had seen .
Unfortunately , the thief was more intelligent than them because while they were speaking , he could run away with the books that he had just stolen .
Angie and the store detective ran after " the false disabled " but he was younger and obviously , he ran faster .
When it seemed impossible to catch him , a girl , who was crossing the street in a wheelchair , crashed into the thief and he fell down on the paviment .
Because of this , the store detective could catch the thief and recovered all books .
To express her gratitude , Angie called the girl as " honorary customer " of her bookshop and gave her a crime novel collection like a present .
When the American series ' House ' was firstly broadcasted on TV , it immediately hooked the audience .
The unusual scenario and the great actor Hugh Laurie made the result really innovative for a TV series .
It is based on Dr. Gregory House , a reputable diagnostician who uses strange and sometimes inappropriate approaches in order to find out what is wrong with his patients .
He only agrees to take over cases nobody else could solve and most of the time he succeeds .
Due to an unsuccessful surgery he had on his leg , he is addicted to painkillers which he makes several attempts to detox from motivated by his only friend Dr. Wilson , but he never really wants to so he gets addicted again .
He is sarcastic and often mean , which drives people away from him .
Nevertheless , he is willing to do literary anything to save a patient 's live , although sometimes he goes too far .
The series had a great appeal on many countries , which is demonstrated by the eight seasons that were produced .
His revolutionary behaviour and the fact that he let nobody restrain him are the reasons for the series huge success .
Also , the medical cases are intriguing and although someone with no medical knowledge may not understand much , the struggle to save a person 's life captures everyone 's interest .
The innovative aspect of ' House ' is that he often takes illegal action , for example breaking into a patient 's house to investigate environmental factors , which may have caused the particular disease and hardly ever is he punished for it .
I believe it well deserved such popularity , as apart from its scenario , it was on the whole qualitative .
My only objection is that it sometimes went too far which made the audience dislike Dr. House .
Nevertheless , it distinct from other medical series as he constantly thinks out of the box .
The first time I knew about volleyball , I was in my last Secondary School year and we were invited to cheer up a local team during a Regional Tournament in Lima , Peru .
I was amazed with the atmosphere at the Coliseum , with its shiny wooden court , the noisy people around it , that sharp sound of the referees 's whistles ... Then I decided to take up the game .
I never imagined how hard the training was , how tiring and demanding the exercises were and how difficult to control the ball was .
Once I got fitter enough , I started enjoying the game , learning its strategies , developing personal and group skills and having fun at the same time .
I would strongly recommend the youth to take up this sport .
They will soon be engaged in a healthy , defiant and never boring activity and also will develop strong bonds with each other , responsibility and compromise .
Volleyball is the best sport ever !
Introduction
The aim of this proposal is to present suggestions regarding the ways in which the extra funding could be used if the benefit of the students and , indirectly , in the benefit of the local community .
Needless to say , in order to combat the rising tide of the social problems in Hampshire , the Education Authority decided to increased funds for the educational sector .
Sports Club
Sportive activities might boots the student 's overall condition and this is the reason why they are necessary .
It is well known that physical activity contributes to improving physical and mental health .
Drama Club
This kind of club will allow students to express their feelings in a non - violent manner , learn how to manage their reactions and develop creative talent .
A drama club will make examining plays such as Shakespeares ' more enjoyable than solely studying them will .
Cookery classes
Cookery classes are very important because students here are young adults that need to have basic skills such as cooking or order to manage themselves and live an independent life .
Cooking classes will helps students spend less money on eating out and they will start eating healthier because by making their own food they will be more aware of what they are eating .
DYI Classes
" Do it yourself " classes improve practical skills .
As most college students will soon leave for university and will live in dorms , without their parents , they are oblidged to solve malfunctions by themselves .
The information they acquired during these courses will help them for the rest of their lives .
Citizenship classes
Another kind of classes that are necessary are citizenship classes as teenagers nowadays are deficient in this field .
These courses will develop the civic sense of students and they will start involving actively in society .
Conclusion
The overall purpose of these actions is to keep young adults in school and to educate them .
The Education Authority believes that social problems are linked with a decrease in participation in extra- curricular activities and it suggests that the college should use extra funding to solve this issue .
Organising clubs and courses such as the ones mentioned above would ensure the improvement of the situation .
TV Today : chance or hazard ?
Today 's television is the paradigm of our society , because of dozens of new channels constantly popping up and only a very few controls are done on the quality of what it 's actually broadcast .
So TV , which could be an invaluable source of information and entertainment , actually is becoming a big issue to the development of our society and new generations in particular .
The potential risks for our new generations
Having an easy access to such a rich offer before having developed the ability to operate correct choices or filter the information received , our kids and juniors are constantly under attack of dangerous behaviour models , being attracted by the ones who seem the most winning and cool ones , without any chance to distinguish if they can be taken as a guide to their growth or not .
The absence of the parents or the fact they usually have no control nor way to drive their choices makes me very worried about the future of our society .
Back to the full potential
It 's not too late , though , to try to have our beloved TV back to the importance which radio had for our parents and grandparents , we only need to see it as a potential new social problem and start a process of control and continuous improvement , maybe giving the most virtuous networks the chance to be highlighted .
I believe that if public transport has no future , then our environment will not have it either .
The car is sometimes represented as an icon of freedom ; moreover , owning a modern car is sometimes related to wealth .
Compared to the use of public transport , one can not deny the convenience of using a car for moving around .
However , the use of public transport , especially in high density cities , allows people to save time while commuting to their study or workplace , as trains and trams do not get stuck in traffic jams .
It not only helps reducing pollution , but also allows users to save money , in a world where the cost of gasoline is exponentially increasing .
I believe that people should limit the use of their cars only to special occasions , such as road trips or long - weekend leisure activities .
Only by doing so , we will help to preserve our atmosphere free of CO2 emissions , and all the grim consequences they have .
Dear camp director ,
Hello , my name is Zabrina .
I read about your summer camp in the internet and I would love to work with you .
I m 16 years old , tall , extroverted , very energetic and cheerful and friendly .
I love kids , and i m very outgoing .
I think I can be very helpful to your camp , helping you taking care of the kids and also helping you in the kitchen because I really love to cook .
Besides , I really need the money for my family .
But I am doing this because I really enjoy creating activities with kids and having a great time with them .
When I was younger i went to a camp , and it was one of the best memories I have so it would be really great to know I would make some kids make the same way .
I really hope you accept me in your camp , and I wait with excitment your response .
Thank you .
Today , I 'd like to share with you a small but historic story , also together with my own view on it .
I hope you would like it .
In the historical river , there was a dynasty called Jin , during which this story took place .
A little boy called Lucky Wang , however , was not so lucky as his name suggested .
In his early age , he lost his mother to illness .
As a result , in order to be sure that he could get the same love from mother like other children , his father married another woman .
On the contrary , the fact was inconsistent with what he expected .
Lucky Wang 's stepmother was such a snake - hearted woman that she did as many cruel things as she could to torture this poor boy .
One day in an especially chilly winter , Lucky Wang 's stepmother got sick suddenly .
Not concerning the harsh environment but her own appetite , she commanded Lucky Wang make a delicious meal with fresh fish .
In desperation , he stepped to the river bank .
Seeing the frozen water surface , he could do nothing but cry .
As time flew , the sun sank little by little , which made Lucky Wang feel more and more helpless .
So depressed was Lucky Wang that he simply lay on the ice with weeping .
It was exactly when he was hesitating whether went home to face the beatings from his stepmother or not that two craps leaped up out of the ice and flopped onto the bank in front of him .
Surprised and delighted , the boy took the fish home and prepare delicious fish soup for his stepmother .
Moved by this little boy 's filial devotion , his stepmother changed her attitude and started to love him from her deep heart .
Ever since then , what filled this family is just happiness and love .
After listening to the small story , some people were deeply moved by the happy ending , however , others thought it was unrealistic .
No matter what the fact was , or even it never happened , the story just wanted to emphasize the importance of Filial Piety .
Even if it was a fiction , the goal to make all the people in the society be filial could also be achieved , which would keep the society harmonious as well as orderly for a long time .
Also , it was the governors ' terminal purpose .
Only through this cultural education combined with other ways , could they keep their government generation by generation as they expected .
How to ensure an adequately financed retirement ?
I am an assertive and proactive girl who is plugging away towards a great number of goals .
However , sometimes , when I am thinking about my future , it is hard to imagine what is waiting for me .
I want to live to a ripe old age , but at the same time I am afraid of it .
Our society is becoming an increasingly elderly one .
It is in fashion to have a small family , but have you ever thought about problems it may cause ?
The greatest one is the burden of financing care .
At this day and age it is falling on the taxpayers .
It does not boost their confidence in future perspectives .
We often hear than no obstacle is ever insurmountable , however , is it true ?
Sooner or later we will face the music .
Only in that moment we will understand that we are one of the millions pensioners who need a lot of different services to live as fulfilled and independent life as we deserve .
We can not rob Peter to pay Paul .
The taxpayers try not to go against the establishment .
They help our ageing population , but we should make some new reforms to subsidise the shortfall in our budget .
Otherwise , this situation will have a detrimental effect on the taxpayers .
First of all , it will be a good idea to encourage young people to start saving money as soon as possible .
In such a way they can remain alert and no matter what will happen .
Yesterdays ' petrified men will become confident .
Secondly , the state can take 5 percent from every salary .
The pensioners will receive their money when they retire .
It will be long - lasting benefit for both parts .
Our state will have a large sum of money which is an invaluable source .
On the other hand the pensioners will be sure in their future .
The crux of the matter is to start these reforms now .
The law of the jungle is not appropriate here .
Everyone should think not just about his benefit , but about others .
We can not make a killing immediately .
However , step by step we will work our way up .
Firstly , I have to say that I disagree about the statement " There is no future for public transport " . I think public transport has lots of advantages , more than travelling by car .
You do n't have to search for parking and you do n't have to pay for parking .
You only have to be aware of when leaves your public transport and be there a couple of minutes before .
You can relax when you are travelling , listening music or reading a book .
Finally , travelling by public transport is generally cheaper than travelling by car .
Maybe you spend more hours than travelling by car but I think it worth it , because you can save money .
I usually travel by public transport and it is the half of the cost than if I do it by car .
So , I think the statement would be like this " There is no future for travelling by car , because public transport is so much more convenient and cheaper " .
I 'm not a huge fan of sports in general , but I do take pleasure in engaging in smaller scale basketball matches , most of which would probably fall into the so - called ' street ' category , or streetball to be more specific .
It takes a higher level of creativity and spontaneity to succeed in it than your usual basketball match , since its flexible rules , no - coach system , intensified relationship between the player and the crowd , and reduced number of participants widen and complexify its field of possible actions .
The ' style ' factor of it ( or " aesthetic value " if you will ) also plays an important role , again , intensifying the relationship between team and the crowd while granting the pleasure of contemplating and executing flowing movement sequences , finishing a play , or just stylishly mocking your opponent .
Not to mention the socially bonding ability of it , while on game tension between the opposing teams is somewhat inevitable , the irreverent , human , no strings attached nature of streetball events always compensate its negative aspects ( which , upon closer inspection , reveal to be shared between every single sports event ) .
It is a fun , culturally - enriching experience which I recommend anyone interested in going beyond the competitive aspect of sports to engage .
The health of teenagers : a latent problem
Nowadays , it seems that teenagers are less healthy than young people who lived 20 years ago .
Researchers have claimed that new generations are likely to suffer from more diseases .
But is it really so ?
Firstly , teenagers today eat lots of junk food , which is definitely harmful , as it leads to obesity ( Summerfield , 2013 ) .
Moreover , they often smoke and drink alcohol , which produces serious physical and mental diseases ( CasaColumbia , 2007 ) .
Furthermore , teenagers have changed their life styles and now they are generally sedentary , since they use their computers or watch TV all day long instead of doing sports .
Nevertheless , governments claim that they nowadays are more aware of the importance of health than in the past .
For instance , in Chile the programme Elige Vivir Sano tries to improve the eating habits of young people in educational institutions , where fun activities are promoted to students by integrating healthy living ( Elige Vivir Sano , 2012 ) .
Lastly , everyone must understand that good health is above wealth .
Parents and children should be informed about the use of drugs and junk food consumption , in order to raise awareness and improve their quality of life .
Travelling by car is great .
We can personalise our needs and wishes , such as listening to songs , talking to our friends and family members , eating and drinking and stopping for food or toilet needs anytime , anywhere .
On the one hand , public transport is more convenient for large cities as it provides service to a larger number of people and we avoid traffic jams and the need to find parking spots , besides the fact that we wo n't get worried about leaving our cars parked on the street and , when we come back , the car could have been robbed or stolen .
On the other hand , cars tend to pollute more than electric trains and such problem ought to be taken into consideration when someone has to decide between using public transport or a car .
The world is getting smaller for people with so many cars around ; it 's about time everyone thought about the community and not about themselves .
The government ought to plan campaigns to make people aware of that and try to find ways to reduce transport fares .
With both sides benefiting , the future of public transport will be safe .
Public transport has been improved to such an extent that nowadays it is probably competing with private transport .
Although we can choose more destinations and it is more comfortable , prices are not competitive enough to definitely substitute the car .
Among all the means of transport , the train has become the most important public transport for short and middle distances .
Without a doubt , long distance journeys are best carried out by plane .
When considering the bus , users feel that it does not offer any advantages compared to the car and it is taken when no other option is possible .
As I see it , drivers really appreciate the freedom of choosing their destination , the time to leave or to arrive , even the people to go with .
If not , they would not make the investment of a car , pay its maintenance cost and fuel .
Indeed , the public transport cost for the same journey done by car hardly recovers the amount invested .
More and more , the oil shortage makes prices for fuel increase so does for transport ; economic policy of importing countries tend to establish saving measures in order to be strategically less dependent .
Moreover , considering pollution , private transport seems to be much more difficult to manage because it is an individual decision .
In the near future , this fact will be seriously taken into account by governments .
To sum up , future generations will have to face the challenge of a sustainable world and surely public transport will play an important role .
Chic & Creative Dessert Lounge
ATUM Desserant is an awesome dessert lounge on 16/F in the new L Square building in Causeway Bay !
I found out about this new shop from friends and pictures online so I decided to come check it out for myself .
As I had arrived just as they open at 1 pm , I had the whole place to myself .
The majority of the space was taken up by a U shape marble counter where customers can sit and observe their desserts being made .
Several lounge sofas were available on the side for big groups to sit together , but the view was what caught my eye as the floor - to - ceiling windows let in a vast amount of natural light .
The patio is probably a bit narrow to place tables outside but people can go out and enjoy the view when the weather is cooler .
The decor was very simple and chic with abstract paintings hanging on the wall which would allude to the style of desserts being served here .
I started chatting with the chef who told me that he wanted to start a dessert lounge for people to relax and enjoy desserts .
He felt that a lot of places out there tend to make the experience too rush where you have to line up for an hour and finish eating in like 20 minutes before they kick you out .
There are currently 9 desserts offered on the menu with prices ranging from $ 108 to $ 138 while there is also the famous Improvisation dessert for 2 at $ 328 . I could n't decide what to get at first because they all sounded so interesting so I asked the chef for recommendations .
He recommended the Bamboo Charcoal as the theme is chocolate which was perfect for me !
Each dessert comes with some appetizers to cleanse our palate .
The test tube contained watermelon juice with sea salt which was very refreshing to drink in the summer heat .
The salt brought out the sweetness of the watermelon while working as a balancing agent so the juice would not be too sweet .
I was told that the drink / soup changes frequently depending on what would be suitable at the moment .
Bamboo Charcoal ( $ 138 ) - I got to watch the chef as he prepared my dessert at the counter and I was getting more and more excited to taste his artful presentation as it came to life !
It literally looked like a piece of abstract art painting .
This was a chocolate theme dessert with bamboo charcoal ice cream , chocolate ice marshmallow , chocolate caviar and raspberry sorbet .
I did n't know what charcoal ice cream would taste like but it was actually chocolate mixed with a bit of charcoal .
The chocolate flavor was rich but not too sweet while the raspberry sorbet was delightfully tart and tangy .
My surprise favorite was the microwave sponge cake that the chef added at the last minute .
He told me that this is a new method of making sponge cake in the microwave that results in very fluffy texture which would be hard to achieve in a traditional oven due to temperature constraint and timing .
It was very light and fluffy while still full of flavor !
The dessert also came with a choice of coffee or tea so I opted for the Lime Flower & Lavender Tea at their recommendation as well .
My tea was brought out with teapot and a small hourglass timer where I am supposed to wait 3 minutes before I should pour the tea .
The smell was wondrous from the lavender while the flavor was almost mint - like and refreshing to drink .
They also offered me some honey to add into my tea when I thought it was n't flavorful enough at first .
Verdict - I was very impressed with the desserts at ATUM Desserant as they were delightful for both the eyes and the mouth !
It would be perfect if they served alcohol as well and they told me that they are in talks with the building management to do so .
The price was n't cheap for dessert but if you take into the entire experience and compared to what you pay for drinks at a bar or lounge , it 's pretty comparable actually .
They also told me that they plan on introducing a new tea set menu during the day so stay tune !
I ca n't wait to go back and try all of their dessert flavors !
As the days go by , more discoveries are being unearthed in a rapid pace .
The major thing I imagine will be found in the next 50 years is magic .
Some advantages are given in the following passage .
For example , we will be able to travel through time .
Imagine looking at Shakespeare in his English class , Einstein in his first science class and Picasso picking up his paintbrush for the very first time .
We will not only witness all of the greatest moments in time but also correct the mistakes we make .
Nonetheless , there are some disadvantages . If a person possesses the magic power that is too powerful for others to defend themselves from , he or she can basically rule the world .
Additionally , terrible wars will break out if one side of the magic possessors get greedy and try to take away other people 's powers .
In the end , the discovery of new things can never come to an end .
Thus , we should prepare ourselves for whatever is coming in the future .
Dear mum ,
It has been a long while since I last met . you and dad .
Hope things are winding down for you well !
Please do not worry too much about me , I am having a joyous time here in Japan .
Undeniably , the food culture disparity between China and Japan is tremendous , although our ancestors were originated from the same ethic .
But still , our customs had evovled a lot .
Due to the geographicall conditions where Japan is located aside Pacific Ocean , people here are adapted to eat raw fish and would like to put it as a main dish to serve customers in most restaurants .
Unfortunately , I do n't like eating raw foods , especially for under - cooked fish .
It makes me arouse a feeling of nausea .
So , I can only have cup noodle for those nights when I leave school at 8:00 p.m.
Apart from the eating culture , everything is going well as people here are generous and hospitable .
My host family take me to different hot spots and teach me how to speak Japanese , in order to facilitate the
progress of integrating to their culture .
Last week , we went to The Mountain Fuji .
The mountain was half - melted with glacier on top .
That was magnificent and mind - blowing .
I have never seen such scenery like that in my country since the climate in South China is humid and hot .
How is life going on with you and dad ?
I am looking forward to hearing from you !
Love ,
Katherine
Everyone has their own favourite sport .
The same goes to me .
I love football the most , as most men would .
There are many things that explain why I prefer football to other sports .
I enjoy playing football with my friends as it can strengthen our friendship and bolster our love .
When we play football , we are definitely will cooperate with the other teammates in order to be the winner .
The one who is in the back position will try their hard to block the opponent teammates from scoring while those who play in the attacking position will make up their strategy in order to score .
This clearly shows that football needs a strong cooperation from all of the team 's players .
My advice to those who are starting this sport is to practise a lot as football needs an unstoppable practice to master the game and be the king of field .
My second advice for them is to always have a cooperative game with the teammates .
All of them .
The worst player is those who do not put their trust in the other teammates and the best one is them who put their full trust in their teammates .
Scuba diving obviously is one of the most exciting and thrilling sports on earth .
Who does not want to feel like an astronaut on our own planet exploring the magical underwater world just on a recreational trip ?
I surely embrace the fact that the diving community has recently been exploding with many new enthusiast members , not only bringing a unique experience into your life , but also enhancing awareness about environmental conservation issues towards a broad public .
The downside of this is that hordes of eager newly trained divers populate the underwater world , often with little clue of the life - threatening risks that they are facing .
I am writing this letter as a wake up call to those who think that their recently earned certification gives them the skills to go out diving wherever they want .
How thoughtless is that ?
From my point of view it should rather be seen as a license to learn .
Consequently I see a pretty massive responsibility for the instructors and dive masters in telling the newcomers about the risks of their sport .
To my great astonishment I witnessed a completely different pattern of behaviour time and again .
I saw dive - buddy 's and even professional dive masters pushing and stimulating fresh divers to extend their limits in order to dive to that spectacular wreck or enter that mysterious cave when they simply do not have the appropriate training for it .
Unbelievable !
Please , let everybody take their own responsibility !
You can imagine that it is really traumatic for divers when they encounter a corpse in the water , not to mention the great distress such a disaster gives to the family that was left behind .
The bottom line is : get as much out of your diving experiences as you can , but stay safely within your own boundaries set by your personal education and practice .
I love to teach because I love to learn and love to share my knowledge with others .
I also love to see the spark flashing in students ' eyes when they understand a concept , try to express themselves with Chinese and finally use it correctly .
For me , learning a language is not only translating the forms to express oneself , but a way to understand how the native speakers describe and interpret this world .
A successful communication between different cultures will happen only when we express oueselves precisely and interpret the information accurately .
Chinese , as a language course , is concerned with encoding and decoding .
Students should master language skills , with which the students can achieve their academic goals .
Meanwhile , students should have deeper understanding of Chinese culture and viewpoints .
Acquiring a language and culture is a long - term process , which includes learning , practicing , making mistakes and correcting .
As a language teacher , I hope my students will have a deeper and broader understanding of this language , their interest in this language will be stimulated by the course and learn the language constantly .
Marilyn Monroe once said ,
" Fame will go by and , so long , I 've had you , fame .
If it goes by , I 've always known it was fickle .
So at least it 's something I experience , but that 's not where I live . "
Let 's take into consideration the last sentence , " It 's something I experience , but that 's not where I live . "
It is obvious that everyone , no matter if they are famous or not , deserves to have a private life .
I am pretty sure that most people even wish for that .
Some of them have to mature for that and some of them feel it from the beginning .
Fame is a side effect of job in the media and so is spine disease for people who work in an office or threat to life or health for firefighters .
It would be completely pointless if we were judging people on the basis of job they have .
Everyone is equal so everyone deserves the same .
People who decide to work in show - business or media have to be aware of having less privacy .
They lose their anonymity , become recognizable ,
what is inseparable part of this kind of occupations .
Because of their fame , they also give employment to other people like paparazzi , journalists .
We live in times where people are very curious about other people 's lives so above - mentioned occupations are necessary ,
but let 's think ... is it really so interesting to know , for example , what Madonna 's second husband eat for breakfast ?
Would we , not - famous , people want that kind of interest ?
Let 's step into famous people shoes .
I think we all have our own magnificent lives and we should focus on them .
This is what counts the most .
So let politicians , film stars , singers and others be .
Michael had been running on fumes all week .
Besides being in charge with organizing his younger sister 's surprise birthday party he had also been put in charge with the entire Information Technology department of the company he worked for .
His former boss retired and nominated him for the position , claiming he was more than qualified and had the adequate skill set in order to keep the department on track as well as making any necessary changes .
The truth was he had been expecting a promotion in a nearby future just not in this precise week .
Michael did n't mean to sound ungrateful , because he was delighted , but the timing was n't anything but the worst .
Michael had to move from his small cubicle to his own office , he had to adapt and he had to do it fast .
The only problem was that it seemed nothing was going to work on his favour , the servers had crashed and he was the one who had to fix it .
As soon as one problem in the company would be solved another one just as infuriating would come up at the party planning .
He was exhausted so he decided to go home , let his mother deal with the party and any problems would be taken care of by his co - workers .
It was risky ; he knew it but had no energy left in him .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
The scope of this report is to give readers an overview in the historical development of water treatment , the changing perception of standardization of water treatment , and the continuous improvement of the technologies that are involved due to the growing lists of water quality parameters to be monitored .
This report is an introductory document meant for students interested in the field of water treatment .
Supply of potable water is perhaps the most important part of all municipal services .
Clean and adequate water supply system is vital aspect in public health and social prosperity .
It is essential for all forms of life by which water participates in numerous biochemical reactions such as distribution of nutrients , removal of metabolic waste , and body temperature regulation .
People depend on water for cooking , drinking , and other domestic purposes .
Water treatment must meet requirements for public and industrial standards .
In all cases , the treatment process must fulfill both quality and efficient use of resources .
CHAPTER 2
HISTORY OF WATER TREATMENT
2.1 WATER TREATMENT IN THE PAST
Mithen 's ( 2010 ) researches show that most ancient civilizations inaugurated themselves near water resources and successful civilizations were dependent upon delicate systems of water transport .
Although an understanding of water quality was not well understood , the importance of water was apparent to our ancestors .
Greek historian Diodorus Siculus , ca .
80 - 20 BC , wrote forty books of world history and in the translated version by Oldfather ( 1939 ) , Siculus provided early documents of purifying water such as boiling and sand filtration , dating all the way back to 2000 BC in ancient Greek .
Since microbiology was yet studied , people at that time could not distinguish between clean and polluted water .
The main precaution measure was purely by judging turbidity of the water and this false practice had remained ever since , even nowadays .
It took years for people to recognize that their sense of smell and vision were not reliable judges of water quality .
Figure 1 A qunat at the National Library of Iran , Tehran ( http://media-1.boo.britainica.com/eb-media/72/987654-004-03E63A41.jpg )
The development of qunats ( Figure 1 ) began about 2500 years ago in Iran , a sloping tunnels drilled into the foot of a hill that contained groundwater .
This ancient type of water supply system is still used in arid regions of the world .
For example , in 1933 the capital city of Iran , Tehran , drew its entire water supply system using the same principle of qunats , though with a lot more complications added into it .
These complications were primarily caused by pollution in the underground water which was previously unknown .
Unlike the past , where people have little knowledge about sanitation and hygiene ; with better scientific understanding and public education , people learn to think and evaluate the quality of the water that they are drinking and using every day .
2.3 BREAKTHROUGHS IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
The history of water treatment continued in 1670 , as two Dutch glasses makers investigated on magnification glasses led to the invention of the microscope .
This scientific discovery broken down the barrier and enables biologist to observe organism that were invisible to the naked eye ( Figure 2 ) .
In 1676 , Scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek ,
The Chachas Restaurant
The " Chachas " is a restaurant situated in a mall in a fringe area of Bern .
People of all ages and cultures eating there .
The restaurants ' slogan is " positive eating " and they definitely live out that phrase .
The large dining room with high ceiling is what catches everybody 's eye , especially if you set your foot into the restaurant for the first time .
There are no walls separating the foyer from the dining room or the kitchen from the guests .
This being said , you can imagine the atmosphere being comfortably airy .
Sitting at any table you can watch the chefs preparing the fresh food .
Long wooden tables , which would be perfectly suitable for a class our size , are placed in the middle of the dining room .
Assembled around those long tables , you will find the smaller tables and even a cosy lounge for people waiting for a free table .
The menu offers a wide range of mouth - watering thai - food dishes including starters , curries , noodles and desserts .
Additionally , they offer a monthly alternating " special menu " card presenting five main courses .
The food is always freshly prepared .
The chefs take great care in selecting only the best quality food .
They avoid using convenience food and any kind of artificial flavors .
Definitely worth pointing out are the excellent fruit juices .
Another aspect I would like to emphasise on is the service .
The waiters go out of their ways ' .
They are courtous and industrious .
The restaurant offers good quality food for reasonable prices and the atmosphere is very welcoming .
And as I know that my classmates prefer light and healthy food , I highly recommend going to the " Chachas " restaurant .
There has been substantial attention to writers ' self - presentation and identity in online social media recently ; Boyed ( 2008 ) studied how teens present themselves online through Myspace site ; Lee ( 2014 : 92 ) reports that people illustrate a different identity in facebook through using " a different language and writing style " .
He asserts that language choice and identity are not " predetermined " and are prone to change ( Lee 2014 : 91 ) ; their change is derived from the context where discourse is negotiated and how " interlocutors interpret the identities being projected " ( ibid : 91 ) .
Therefore , context , including the participants , their social purpose , their means and channel of communication , plays a role in language choice and identity construction .
Lee ( 2014 : 92 ) refers to the " forms of participation " in a social media and having the sense of audience in mind as the key elements that can possibly change " the way people think of themselves " that changes the way they present themselves and their identity online thereby .
He refers to using nicknames , for example , as a way of self - expression that can shape the audience 's mind and interpretation of writers ' identity .
Lee ( 2014 ) defines three ways of self - presentations in most social media : ( 1 ) " online profile " ( p. 97 ) , that is the " entry point to social networking " .
In Boyed 's terms , profile is an important space where writers tell the audience " who they are and how they want to be seen " ; a link that connects people 's " offline and online identities"(2008 : 129 ) .
Examining teens ' identity construction in social media , he states that profile is where teens " express salient aspects of their identity for others to see and interpret " ( 2008 : 129 ) ; ( 2 ) " continuous status updating " that is updating about life and sharing experiences from the " first person " point of view and ( 3 ) " visual representation " that is " visual images " ( p. 98)(emphasized as in original ) .
Continuous updating , as a way of self - presentation , is one of the features of blog writing by which blog - writers can share their emotional experiences and views with the audience .
If the weblog - writers prefer presenting the world from their own angle , through using the first person pronoun , or tell their stories through the readers ' eyes , by involving other grammatical subjects , is among the focuses of this study .
It seems that checking the Subject , as an interpersonal element in the clause , can provide evidence of my student - writers ' self - presentation and involvement in the discourse constructed in their blogs .
This is also relevant to the notion of stance and position or the existence of author in the text .
It was a sunny day in Turin .
The children were playing outside , old and new couples were enjoying their love and everything seemed to be absolutely bright .
In the busy streets , a student was walking fast , apparently unaware of all this .
Suddenly , he turned left and stopped , as if he did n't know what to do next .
He then saw a young woman waving at him .
A few minutes later , they were together in a bar .
Michael was still hurt .
They had plans for the future before .. he thought he would have married her .
And then severything had crashed .
Michael tried not to think about it and to listen instaed to what she was saying ...
Her voice was weak and fleble while she said " .. and I was really depressed , you know and then I thought ... we always talked about going in India ... and I thought ... maybe we could fix everything .. so .. I'm just asking .. will you go with India with me ? "
She looked at him and he thought she was still beautiful .
He loved her and she was trying to get back with him , as he had hoped in the last months .
But suddenly he thought he was really angry with her .
" I 'm sorry , but I do n't want to hear from you anymore " he said , and then stood up and without watching her walked out of the bar .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Dear Paul ,
Thanks for your e - mail .
I 'm glad to hear that you are having a great time abroad volunteering for this international cultural organization .
I think that it is a wonderful idea to collect different experiences before starting university studies .
As you know I spent last month in Eastern Europe working for a similar cultural organization and I have a hands - on experience in organising a cultural festival and particularly musical concert .
I loved my job there and if I only had an opportunity to do it again , I definitely would .
During my staying there I was responsible for taking care of musicians and contacting media .
What I especially loved about my job there , was the opportunity to work in such a diverse group of people .
I learned how to respond to different people 's needs resulting from cultural differences and expectations .
I also appreciated much the practical experience I could get there - how to organise job at the office so that everything goes smoothly and everyone gets what they want , how to use social media for advertising and promotion , how to communicate with press and television etc .
I look forward to hearing from you soon and I hope that you 'll find this experience as amazing as I did .
All the best .
XYZ
I agree with the statement .
It is known that gossip magazines are bought by lots of people who are interested in what these people do , the kind of clothes they wear or even the tattoos they have .
In fact , although they are famous , they are people too , which means that they should be free to do whatever they like in their free time .
This happens because some people is famous just because they have had an affair with a singer or a footballer , so the only thing people want to know about them is if that is true or not , and when it happened .
It would come to an end if society changed the concept of " famous people " .
In the case of politicians , I do n't mind what they do in their holdidays , for example , if they work properly when they have to .
But I think there is an exception : monarchy .
I think Royal Family is an exception because they are supported by all the citizens , so I think we ( as citizen ) have the right to know eveything they do if we want .
I mean , it would be better that there was more transparency as far as how they spend " our money " is concerned .
I think journalists should follow famous people only when they do something related to their profession or the fact that has made them famous .
Soon on your plans : College Film Club
Do you have a great passion for films ?
Do you like to socialize and meet new people ?
Then College Film Club is just for you !
Let me introduce myself .
I was just one more student from our college , with plenty of free time and looking for something else to do .
It happens that one day a friend of mine took me to a Film Club session .
I now feel complete .
Do n't you want to feel the same ?
Come and join us !
We meet every Monday in the college theatre .
Every week we watch a different type of film so that we can please every member and improve our cinematography knowledge .
This is followed by an animated discussion in English , accompanied by drinks from the coffee bar , which is open late , of course !
Every now and then , we have special guests coming over , such as professional reviewers or independent directors .
We 've had , for example , Hugh Williams and George King .
Next week we 'll be watching " Dancer in the Dark " , by Lars von Trier , a distinctive Danish filmmaker .
Will I see you there ?
We 're expecting you !
When Elena saw the house for the first time , she could n't believe her eyes !
It was a bright sunny day and the birds were peacefully singing .
Meanwhile , Elen was going to receive a birthday present from her boyfriend , Ken : a house for both to live .
At first , Ken , had thought about giving some cruise tickets as a present .
But after a while he thought about something bigger , huge and more expensive .
A house for them to live !
Ken was not a small guy , short hair , sharp teeth and nose , light skin , blond hair and sky - blue eyes .
That day was the day , Elena 's birthday , and Ken was n't sure how to give that massive present when suddenly he had an excellent idea .
He had already thought about that so he grabbed a blindfold and put it over Elena 's eyes .
When Elena took it off she was blown away , completely amazed with what she saw .
In front of her was a stunning house .
It was enormous , with huge windows , white walls and with superb views of the sea and the shore .
Elena could n't be happier with the situation .
She also appeared to be relieved that she would n't have to live with her parents anymore .
After that memorable moment , she could now have a thrilling life next to the person she loved .
They lived happily ever after .
That morning , Michael woke up full of energy , and feeling very optimistic about his first day in his new job .
He carefully chose the clothes he was going to wear .
He chose a blue tie and a light grey suit .
It took him twenty minutes to do his hair .
Every single detail should be perfect to get the best first impression .
-You only have one opportunity to cause a good first impression- he said to himself .
When he was totally satisfied with his look he turned on and off the light of his bedroom eight times .
Michael always thought that this little ritual gave him an extra piece of luck .
He went out of his little apartment and walked full of confidence to the bus stop .
He thought happily that he was not only on his way to his new job but he was on his way to his new life .
When he arrived the receptionist told him to go to his boss office .
He knocked on the door .
A woman 's voice answered .
-Yes , come in , please- .
He liked her at first .
She was a very kind and intelligent woman , and Michael was sure that she was going to be a perfect boss and they will work very easily together .
After the meeting and when he was leaving he turned back and said : -
And congratulations for the baby!- His boss looked at him in anger:- Do you think that I am pregnant?- .
-No , no , I mean ... , I do n't think you are pregnant at all- .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Our city offers to visitors a huge range of possibilities to go shopping .
If you are crazy about fashion but your budget is really short , there are a lot of second - hand shops where you can buy a lot with a little money .
Window shopping through our high street is another option .
Here you will find all trendy brands and much more .
For example , people interested in cooking has some gourmet shops where they will be able to taste our traditional products .
A must for all tourists although they do n't want to buy anything is the oldest shopping centre in the country .
This magnificent building is situated in the city centre and it was built seventy years ago in an ancient palace .
Other modern malls are located in the suburbs but do n't worry , our city has an excellent public transport service to get there .
When the weather is good , especially during spring , market street are really popular .
You can buy all you can imagine there but one of them is really extraordinary .
It is celebrated on the mother 's day on May , the first Sunday and it is located in the city 's longest avenue , around a kilometre plenty of flowers where you can make your own bouquet for your mother 's present .
These are some ideas to enjoy shopping while you are visiting our city but there are much more to discover !
Yes , that 's true that the car is far more convenient than the public transport .
When you 're driving your own car you are getting a lot of comfort .
You are sitting on a comfortable seat .
You are listening to your favourite music .
The temperature level is exactly what you like .
And you never , ever , will contact with other people .
Well , there can be some pretty girls among the passengers for sure , but it 's far too often that you will have to sit near some stinky bum .
More than that , the car is always there when you need it .
You have not wait till it arrives and it is never late .
Your car will always go to the right place -- no transport changes , no awkward routes .
But -- will it always be the best choice ?
No , not at all !
When you want to travel the world or just going to visit your parents , which are two thousand miles from you , it would be better to take a bus or a train .
You wo n't be able to cover such a distance in one day .
So in that case it 's better to leave your car at home .
And what if the car you 're driving will break ?
Just imagine that you are sitting in the broken car , at night , without any sign of a car service for fifty miles around you !
High cost of fuel will definitely be the lesser evil in this situation .
So I 'd have to say this .
On short distances , maybe one or two hundred miles , a car is ideal .
But if you take a big journey alone , you 'd better take an old good bus , just like 100 years ago .
People would say that travelling on public transport it is the future for our lives .
But sincerely there is no future at all for it , as our lives nowadays are becoming more a more demanding in terms of multitasking , goal seekers and family conciliation .
Public transport offers a range of timetables for trains , buses or metro , but when it comes to deal with the day - to - day tasks we very often find travelling by our own car it is the easiest way .
For instance , travelling with children it is very annoying on public transport due to all the security issues involved .
There is no easy way to carry our weekly shopping , stuff for the gym or instruments on public transport .
We try to steal minutes from every hour to find time to do all the things we want to do .
Waiting at the bus station for our next bus after just roughly missing the last one , being stuck in the middle of a crowd trying to reach the same train as everyone else , does n't make us life any easier at all .
At the en of the day we decide to use our car , as the way we live today combining work , family and hobbies all at once , cars becoming mobile houses seem to be our best option .
Dear Paul ,
I hope you 're doing well and everything is ok .
I 'm writing to you because I want to tell you about my experience .
You wanted to know what I was said to do before and during the concert , so I try to explain everything .
The concert took place in Los Angeles , it was a month ago as I think . You can be sure that I had a time of my life .
Everything was so exciting about helping at this concert .
Starting from sending the invitations to the most famous people in the city and calling the shots .
I had to take care of other volounteers .
I had to check their work and correct their mistakes .
Speaking of which , it was n't easy .
Dealing with other people is the hardest part , escpecially when they 're the same age as you .
I think I did my best .
Another good thing is that I had a chance to talk to journalists .
They came from different parts of the world .
There were people from Russia , Germany , Brasil .
That was really great to meet them and to talk with them .
By the way , do you know Jess Morrow ?
She 's a journalist from the New York Times .
She 's very famous and I told her everything she wanted to know about the show .
Before the concert started , me and my co - workers had to clean the stage , set up the equipment and make sure everything works well : the sound , the lightning and the instruments .
Helping at this concert was a hard work but very inspiring .
I 'm glad that I had a chance to do it .
Best wishes ,
XYZ
My father has had a boat for as long as I can remember , so I 've been sailing since I was a little girl .
I particularly enjoy the sense of freedom that it gives me : there 's nothing better than being out on the water with only the sound of the waves , and of the wind on the sails .
In my experience I found that people either consider sailing a very boring sport , or a very dangerous one ;
I guess because I 've been practicing for such long time , I do n't agree in either case .
Indeed people can get bored while sailing , if they just sit and do n't interact with the rest of the crew ,
and it can be dangerous too , if one does n't know how to move on a boat .
Sailing is all about cooperation , and to really enjoy it one needs to do it regularly , to be able get to know the crew and find the most suitable role on the deck .
Being a good sailor does n't mean knowing all about it , the point of sails , the winds , and so on , for me a good sailor is someone that knows the boat s / he 's sailing on , and is able to deal with all the possible situations and also kind of people s / he can possibly have to deal with .
If you take the time to ask around , you 'll find out that a lot of the most experienced sailors never took classes .
So the most important piece of advice I would give to everyone is : try ,
and if the first time is not so good , try again : in different weather conditions , with different people , and different kind of boats .
Maybe you will not get addicted to it as much as I am , but I 'm sure you will have a great time , and in the worst case you will have the chance to meet wonderful people .
I would not say that there is no future for public transport .
First of all public transport is far more convenient for people in big cities .
Our monthly fuel expenses can be reduced by using public transport to get to the workplace .
Nowadays environmental pollution is also important that 's why public transport should be promoted as environmentally friendly way of transport .
Not always car is much more convenient , for example in a big city it is far more convenient to use underground than a car during the rush hour .
When we use public transport we can read a newspaper or book and when we driving a car it 's impossible .
In my opinion nowadays driving a car is very stressful because of traffic intensity .
Driving a car is also more tiring , driver must be concentrated all the time .
Of course not always public transport is more convenient .
When we want to go on a weekend trip to the countryside car is irreplecable for families with children or animals .
Also go on holidays by car can be very comfortable .
With car we are more independent than with public transport .
There are many pros and cons but for sure we ca n't say that there is no future for public transport .
This summer I am bringing a group of 12 to 14 year - old students to Athens and I am looking for suitable accommodation .
At present I am uncertain about the number of the students , but it will probably be about 15 .
While we are there , we not only want to look at the many attractions in the city , but we would like to visit some of the beautiful places nearby , so we are looking for a reasonable priced hotel , in the city centre , with good transport links .
It is possible that we will stay in Athens about ten days .
During our stay we require the following : twin - bedded rooms , in the same hotel , breakfast and on occasion , evening meal .
Furthermore I would like to ask you if there are any individuals who can be able to look after groups like us ?
Are you able to arrange activities and local transportation for us ?
Also it would be great if you could inform me of some special discounts , such as cheaper air travelling .
I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible .
Introduction
The principal objectives of this proposal are to outline the main problems that the company 's website has , and suggest ways that the web designers can deal with them .
The final section of this proposal makes some recommendations about what should be done to elevate the website aesthetic and improve user - friendliness .
Problems with the current website
A survey was conducted among the 200 people who filled the complaints .
The majority of people were of opinion that the site was clunky and hard to use and nearly two thirds of the participants considered that the design needs to be modernised .
Others problems cited included pretty low uptime of the website , connection issues and login problems , particularly correct credentials not working .
Ways to address the issues
I think the website needs to be revamped to attract more users .
The look and feel should follow the " material design " standards as they are defined by Google and should use more modern fonts .
As for the server and database administrators , they should immediately resolve the issues regarding the backend part of the website .
Recommendations
I would like to make the following recommendations :
Implement a tutorial to facilitate the usability for new users , and also make it possible to retake the tutorial as per user request .
Conduct a survey on a minimum of one thousand people on what features should the website include .
Develop a better feedback system so users can express their concerns and questions in a more detailed way .
I assure you that if these recommendations are implemented , the website will improve significantly .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
Although it had been a tiring day she was very pride of that little sheet of paper .
She had just got the job and she wanted to show what her skills were .
No one could have imagined that she was such a brilliant person and when she gave the article to the boss the latter was quite astonished .
The next days the boss ordered her to write an article about the natural beauties of Colombia , a little State located in South America .
So she left on Monday and she landed in Bogotà Tuesday .
Never had she seen such a high waterfall .
She used to live in a flat so she had never disovered how much the world was different and beautiful .
That evening she met with a local guide she was invited to taste the local food and to dance with the traditional clothes of that friendly civilization .
The following day she came back to London where all her family was waiting for her since they werevery curious about the weird Alison 's trip .
Sport is probably as old as humanity itself .
All over the world people of different ages are very fond of sport and games .
Sport not only helps people to become strong and to develop physically but also makes them more organized and better disciplined in their daily activities .
Sport helps people to keep in good health .
Needless to say that sport plays a very important role in our life .
It gives us much pleasure and many moments of joy .
It 's popular among young and old people .
Many people do morning exercises , jog in the morning , train themselves in fitness clubs and gyms , and take part in sports competitions .
Other people like sports too , but they only watch sports competitions , listen to sports news .
They prefer reading interesting articles about athletes and sport events , but they do n't go in for sports .
There are a lot of kinds of sports such as swimming , wrestling , cycling , box , football , hockey , track and field athletics and so on .
There are summer and winter kinds of sports .
The summer kinds of sports are , for example , swimming , athletics , football , volleyball , basketball and others .
The winter kinds of sports are , for example , figure skating , skiing , ice hockey etc .
Among the popular sports in our country are football , basketball , swimming , volleyball , tennis , gymnastics , figure skating and others .
You can choose a sport for any season and for any taste .
I 'd like to describe some of them .
In spring and summer many people prefer to go in for jogging .
This is very popular sport and very useful for your health .
You slow run and enjoy the beauty of nature around .
This kind of sport is getting more and more popular over the world .
If you go to Europe you can see a lot of people who go in for jogging .
Speaking about sport I ca n't help saying about football , because this is very spectacular kind of sports .
There are a lot of football teams , football events , and fan clubs in almost every country of the world .
Some football players are world famous ; they make excellent careers and take part in each championship .
Football matches attract a lot of spectators , who come supporting their favorites .
Many people today go in for extreme sports .
Perhaps , they find ordinary sports too boring and unexciting .
It is also known that extreme sports help to build character and form a strong personality .
There are different types of extreme sports , for example , rock climbing , rafting , scuba diving , surfing , snowboarding , parachuting , hang - gliding , bungee jumping etc .
These activities usually involve speed , height and a good level of physical training .
However , they become more and more popular even among the beginners .
Doing such sports people learn how to overcome difficult situations and how to survive in an emergency .
It also develops patience and self - control , and helps to control your fear .
More importantly , it gives the sense of achievement .
Let 's consider some kinds of extreme sports .
Take bungee jumping .
You jump off a bridge and you fall and fall , and then , just before you hit the ground or water , an elastic rope pulls you back .
In skysurfing you jump out of an airplane and use a board to " surf " the air , doing gymnastics in mid - air !
Winter sports have always an element of danger .
For example snowboarding , which has all the excitement of surfing but on snow , is more dangerous even than skiing .
Ice diving is for those people who are absolutely crazy .
You put on diving equipment and dive under a frozen lake .
And , if that 's not enough , you try to walk upside down on the ice !
A lot of people are not fit nowadays .
It 's a big problem today .
If you want to feel fit you 'd better go in for one kind of sport or another .
I think that everyone must do all to be healthy .
Good health is better than the best medicine .
To tell the truth I do n't do sports regularly and it is not an essential part of my daily life .
In summer I go swimming as there is a beautiful pond with pure water where my Granny lives .
In winter I go in for skating .
If I have free time I go to the nearest skating - rink with my friends and we have much pleasure , skating together .
This kind of sport is very elegant .
You should control your body very well if you wish to skate gracefully .
I should n't call myself a sports fan .
Of course , I watch sports competitions on TV from time to time , like swimming or running .
I admire extreme kinds of sport .
I think they are really cool .
I admire people who dare to do such sports .
Television is not an issue of general consensus .
It is definitely a way of spending our free time .
However , does it teach us something ?
Does it help us grow and improve our knowledge ?
On the one hand , it is said to help people to spend quality time as they can learn about the most varied subjects from the comfort of their homes .
It is possible to watch documentaries , the news , concerts , plays and learn about current affairs .
On the other hand , there are programmes which bring nothing new into our life .
Therefore , one should not waste time watching tem .
Violent programmes , reality shows and others alike have nothing to teach .
In these cases , TV is undoubtedly bad entretainment .
All in all , it is my belief that if we use it properly , i.e. , if we carefully choose what to see , television can have an important role to play in the learning process of everyone of us , and in particular , in the life of the ones who can not afford travelling , buy books or live in an educated environment .
If you are looking for a film that provides you with suspense and action at the same time , I recomend you to watch " Now you see me " .
The film , directed by Louis Leterrier , is about four magicians , known as " The Four Horsemen " that join together by a mysterious benefactor , and during their presentations they do all kind of illegal stuff , such as robbing a bank or ripping off their own boss .
Because of them , there 's an agent of the FBI , Dylan Rhodes , that persecute them through different states of EE.UU .
The characters in charge of the four magicians are Jesse Eisenberg , Isla Fisher , Dave Franco and Woody Harrelson .
They are capable of making you think they really know how to illusion someone .
Morgan Freeman is the best actor of all times and perfect for the role of developer tricks and helper of the FBI to catch the " Four Horsemen " .
Also there is no other better for the role of agent as Mark Ruffalo .
But it 's not just the acting that it 's great in the film .
The shots of Las Vegas , New Orleans , Paris and New York are wonderful , and the fact that nothing is computerized at the time to witness the magic tricks it absolutely amazing .
So if you enjoy magic tricks , surprises , very handsome actors and splended actresses , why would you miss it ?
What I did not in Vacations
During vacations I did n't enjoy my time because I did n't find out that I am a wizard .
Also , aliens did not get me and practice surgery on me .
Sadly , I could n't meet Lady Gaga nor Justin Timberlake .
I was very disappointed because I did not do any of these things during vacations .
Since I did n't discover that I am , in fact , a wizard , I could n't get a magic wand .
I did not go to Hogwarts not turn my brother into a frog .
Being normal gets old and not being a wizard is shabby .
As aliens did n't kidnap me I did not travel all around the galaxy during this vacations week .
I did not see the planets nor meet any sexy alien girl from Saturn .
Staying at home all day is regrettable and not being kidnapped by aliens gets really boring .
After not being a wizard nor kidnapped by aliens , I did not meet Lady Gaga in New York nor hang out with her and Justin Timberlake .
We three counldn't sing together nor make laugh of Kim Kardashian .
No one likes being " unfamous " and I do n't like not being Lady Gaga 's friend .
Indeed , what I did in vacations was sleep the whole day , hang out with my " Unfamous " friends and write and compose two and a half songs .
Watching " as in heaven , in hell " was hilarious although it is a horror movie .
But , lets face it doing these things is not as wonderful as discovering magic powers , being kidnapped by aliens or singins a song with Justin Timberlake and Lady Gaga .
Finally , the holidays have started .
Just a few more days and then we will be on our way to our holiday destination .
We will be travelling by car to a campsite in Gemany .
It will be our third time at this campsite .
Even though it is a large campsite it feels small and cosy .
The campsite borders on a small lake which can be quite cold , even in summer .
However , we usually do not let this stop us from going into the water .
We like to visit the cities and various sights in the area .
One of the sights we definitely want to see is the former border between West - Germany and East - Germany .
We also like hiking and are planning on doing that a couple of times per week .
The region where we will stay has a nice system that encourages people to hike .
At some point during your hikes you can collect stamps in a special booklet .
For somewhat younger children this is a nice incentive to participate in these hikes .
Some hikes are short , but steep and some hikes are long and involves no climbing at all .
We will probably stay at this campsite for about three weeks and besides the hiking we will read and laze about .
Hello ! My name 's Vanesa , I 'm 33 and I really enjoy watching soap operas .
These days I watch a lot of different soap operas , though my favourite one is -and will always be- Friends .
The plot is about six young people ( they 're about 26 ) : Ross , Rachel , Monica , Chandler , Joey & Phoebe .
They live in New York City and have a lot of comical and romantic adventures , all of them related to their friendship .
What could I say about the characters ?
Well , Ross is a paleontologist that works in the Natural History Museum , and he 's Monica 's older brother .
Monica works as the main chef in a restaurant situated in Manhattan , she is Rachel 's best friend since high school and she longs for a boyfriend ( she finally marries Chandler ) .
Chandler is the funny guy and he works as a stock agent .
Rachel has always been daddy 's little girl but , when she brakes her engagement at the beginning of the soap opera , she loses all her money and has to work as a waitress in a cafe ( though she gets a job related to fashion world after a few years ) .
Joey is ... well , he 's Joey : not so clever , a great one for the girls and -the most important- Chandler 's best friend .
And finally we have Phoebe , a veggie and bohemian girl who enjoys singing and playing the guitar and who works as a massage therapist .
The most interesting thing of ' Friends ' , in my opinion , is the love story between Ross and Rachel : the plot starts when Rachel comes to live with Monica in her apartment and Ross falls in love with her .
This story continues until the end of the soap opera , when Ross and Rachel finally have a child ( Emma ) .
But there are a lot of funny stories , like Phoebe having her stepbrother 's children , or Joey becoming a great soap opera actor .
I recommend ' Friends ' to everyone .
I think it 's the best soap opera ever made .
Living without Internet : Is it possible ?
Oh my God !
Today is the day . I have been told that I will be moving to my new apartment .
Good news !
But , wait !
It will also mean not having access to the Internet for a month !
Will I survive ?
Will my life be the same ?
First of all , I have to say that I totally depend on the Internet .
From 7 am to 7 pm , my computer is running surfing the Internet .
Not only I use it for leisure , but I also use it for work . I would have to change the way I do things on a daily basis .
Secondly , I have many friends living abroad . I communicate with them using Skype .
Will I need to use the phone instead ?
Unlike the Internet , phone calls are really expensive .
I am not sure if I could afford it .
Will I find myself writing letters ?
Another thing to consider is not having that open window to the world .
Will have to start buying magazines and newspapers to be informed ?
In conclusion , my life will be completely changed .
My daily routine is based on having access to the Internet : talking to my friends , reading he newspapers , the forecast weather , and so on ... I will have to change my life .
The wrong choice can lead to a big mistake that can influence on our life and people around us .
Michael was a person that was afraid of making any mistakes .
A new person entered his life one day .
Michael was nervous when he was asked to do some work together with that new fellow .
What if that the boy could be smarter than he himself ?
The only way was to show and prove everyone that he was the best .
So , he decided to ignore him absolutely .
He did n't answer to his questions and did n't want to use all his ideas .
The work was done and Michael was proud because everything was done by himself .
The newcomer could only watch it with a shy smile .
Their boss checked the work then .
He wanted to know his partner 's opinion too .
The poor boy said he was inspired by Michael 's enthusiasm .
He praised the Michael 's work .
It was perfect and he would be glad just to improve some things , to change the structure , to exclude unnecessary facts , to add some bright illustrations and so on .
The boy had changed everything in the content of the work by the end of their conversation .
They both left the office soon .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Feeble souls
Most people love donating money to different charities , but have you ever thought why it gives us such pleasure ? I believe it 's because , as humans , when we see someone happy , it makes us happy , especially if we are the reason for that happiness .
The problem is choosing who to donate to .
Is it the poor , homeless children in your country or the starving people in Africa , or is it some cancer organizations ?
I choose none of the above .
I 've never understood why most people see a closed set of charitable organizations to choose from when they want to donate money .
In other words , they choose only from the most common causes .
When I think about donating money I see sick children and adults with rare diseases , and small groups of scientists and doctors doing their best to help them , but who do n't have enough money for research . I choose them because I know that they are the least people who get help - because how would people help them if they do n't know about them ?
First thing I 'd do if I want to make a donation is go on the internet , and search Google for rare diseases .
Then I 'll look for the diseases which the scientists are currently working on finding their cure .
I 'll be left with a lot to choose from , so I 'll see which illness is the hardest to endure and choose this one to donate my money to .
I have one of those unknown diseases , and I could easily donate to the doctors working on my illness , but I probably wo n't . I know that there are a lot of other people with diseases that are way harder than my own , and they need a cure much more than I do .
This makes me realize that even if I have a disease , as hard as it is , I 'm still better than others and I 'm grateful .
I 'm grateful I can bear my sickness and live with it , because others ca n't .
To sum up , I believe more people should start donating to the uncommon charity organisations , to the ones who need more help .
It would be sufficient to just see the smile on their face .
We should all be thankful we are what we are , because we could be a lot worse .
According to Berkow ( 2004 ) , Airway management is one component of anaesthesia procedure to ensure the patient airway is opened .
An example of an intervention in airway management is the ventilation mask that Mr. Sharma was using .
Also , this practice is the primary consideration for an efficient post anaesthesia care ( Scoot , 2012 ) .
The majority of patients that has had a general anaesthetic , as Mr. Sharma , must recover in a PACU ( Post Anaesthesia Care Unit ) to monitor the vital signs , specially the airways management due to the anaesthesia , impeding any postoperative complication ( Scoot , 2012 ; Farrell & Dempsey , 2011 ) .
The first 24 hours of post surgery , is considered the most critical period , because the patient can present , primarily , lung disorders , and the nurse need to maintain the cardio - respiratory stability ( Popov & Peniche , 2009 ) .
Addressing the airway management after Mr. Sharma 's admission on PACU , the first procedure that the nurse should do , is follow the A - G assessment protocol , to review the stability and the airway patency of the patient , sustaining the pulmonary ventilation to prevent hypoxemia and hypercapnia ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
Mr. Sharma 's airway should be spare and clean from mucus or blood ( Pudner , 2010 ) .
Due to the surgery Mr Sharma is in supine position , but this position reduces his oxygenation ( Snowball , 2012 ) , and also can impede the air passage that is related to the anaesthesia effect , where the tongue and the lower jaw fall backward .
Hence , he needs oxygen supply to prevent any airway obstruction .
Therefore , the oxygen therapy needs to continue immediately along with his admission , via nasal cannula or oxygen mask within 4 to 6L / min , until the anaesthesia effects are completely gone and the patient 's oxygen saturation be restored ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
Thus , Mr. Sharma is been given O2 via Hudson mask 6L / min , because he received general anaesthesia and all of his muscles are relaxed and at the moment he do not have control over his reflexes ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
To help in this issue , the nurse should certificate that Mr. Sharma is confortable , and elevate the head of the bed for a more upright position in order to facilitate and increase his oxygenation , helping him to recover faster his respiratory instability ( Snowball , 2012 ) .
The reason why walking is the best sport on the face of the Earth
First of all , let me address the title of this article .
I realise walking is not considered a sport by everyone .
I think it is a wrong way of thinking of sports .
Therefore , I am going to explain the advantages of walking .
I would like to start saying it is free .
This could be seen as something minor , but being able to do the sport you love without paying is an incredible advantage .
Secondly , I love its freedom ; no pun intended .
You can walk whenever and wherever you like .
That is priceless .
Thirdly , walking gives you a longer life expectancy .
There are a lot of studies that prove this .
Last but not least , you do not need any kind of special equipment or people .
You can go walking alone and without shoes if you please .
Nevertheless , you learn a lot of things about any sport once you start doing it .
Therefore , I would like to share some things with you .
You can start walking as you like , despite that , you should wear comfortable clothes and shoes .
The reason is that , the longer you walk , the more you will feel what you are wearing .
The second advice is you should try to find the best places to walk around you .
The sightseeing is very important once you start walking .
I hope I have convinced all of you to go walking .
I am a true believer in walking .
Do not forget to greet me when we met on the road .
All students are different in terms of their cognitive styles , learning levels and achievements as well as motivation , personality , and pace of learning .
When there are students with varied levels in English , it may be challenging for teachers to prepare for or deliver the course .
Here are some of my solutions for this issue .
First of all , determining the needs of the students is always the top priority .
While conducting a need analysis , you can have a general picture of learners ' motivation in learning English .
After that , teachers are supposed to use partnership and grouping exercises and activities in order to meet individual 's needs .
Through teamwork , students with varied levels can cooperate and learn from each other through discussions .
It is beneficial for both the upper and lower achiever because they can assist or get help from each other .
Differentiated instructions , giving different tasks for the same activity , are proved to be necessary in a class with varied levels of students .
Teachers can assign tasks which have different levels of difficulty , or different numbers of tasks to students with different levels .
Moreover , instead of using a core textbook , or using different levels of textbooks , carrying out a theme - based approach is more appropriate , and it also saves teachers ' preparation time .
Finally , preparing supplementary for both the upper or lower level of students , so that the higher achievers can stay excited and challenged , while the lower achiever can also learn by their own pace of learning .
Young people in Ukraine are more comprehensively developed than young people in USSR .
Now youngsters have open access to knowledge and information through the Internet .
Students have more opportunities to learn languages , discover foreign experience , pass internships and study abroad .
The number of Ukrainian students who study abroad increases every year .
Our generation is more developed and diverse in spheres of modern culture , including arts , music , literature etc .
The most valuable thing is that there are so many supporters of different trends in all these areas .
In Ukraine young people are different too .
Some people prefer one style of music , some - another .
That 's why it 's difficult to define one general style for the generation .
Discussing music styles , people in my country prefer pop and rock .
We can define it by list of TOP music charters on music channels .
There are a lot of Ukrainian executives .
It 's necessary to emphasize that Ukrainian music has changed a lot from the time of Independence and now is developed very fast .
If we speak about TV programs , Ukrainian youngsters like popular American and Russian serials , like the Theory of big bang , Suits , Breaking bad , the Game of thrones , the Kitchen and so on . I must admit that some representatives of Ukrainian youth watch too many serials and waste a lot of their time .
I think this problem is typical for almost all countries .
In clothes , youngsters prefer to wear famous fashion brands .
Many people follow fashion designers .
It 's interesting to admit that there is fashion on Ukrainian traditional clothes " vishyvanka " now .
I hope after reading of my report you will have some minimal understanding of Ukrainian reality .
Also I encourage you to visit Ukraine and to see its sightseens , to feel culture and speak to nice people !
I live in a small town called Tui .
It 's in the northwest of Spain , in Galicia .
It 's a small town and there are not too many options of travelling by public transport .
My town has got a lot of little villages around it , and it 's very difficult to create a public transport service , because there are long distances between the different places , and there are not enough people to make it profitable .
If you want to go to Vigo or other city which is near , the coach service is a good and not too expensive option .
The coaches are slow , so most of the people prefer the car .
If your destiny is further away , another good option is to travel by train .
We have got a small train station in Tui , so we can go to a lot of places by train .
Train is more expensive , but at the same time , it is more comfortable .
So I think that creating a small bus line between the villages will help a lot of people , especially the older ones .
Dear Mr./Ms .
I am writing in connection with your job advertisement ( Club organiser ) which I 've seen on the noticeboard of my language school .
I have been learning English for 5 years and I hope to take the FCE ( Cambridge exam ) soon . I also write a blog about art on English .
As a member of student club at my college , my responsibility is to organize events and collaborate with many students from different departments .
Working on projects help me improve my organizational and planning skills .
In order to create and maintain a team spirit , I use different tools like icebreakers and energizers .
Watching movies in groups is a great way to discuss different topics , like justice , personal identity and discrimination .
For the beginning , short and animated movies would be the best , such as movie " Validation " that teaches us how words have the power to change our lives .
With my experience and range of skills I am sure I can contribute to your idea and organise great movie nights .
If I can provide you with any further information on my background and qualifications , please let me know .
I look forward to receiving your reply .
Thank you for your consideration .

Mr Jascolka
Welcome to London , tourists !
This report should help you buy genuine goods from our city .
First of all , you should avoid small market places .
They are known for selling fake products .
An example would be the Camden Town market .
If you 're looking for top quality products , we would recommend going to the Westfield shopping centre .
You will find top notch electronics and general goods .
If you prefer shopping outshide , taking a trip to King Street would be the the thing to do .
If you want typical souvenirs , you can go to the Buckingham Palace , you will find a lot of small shops that sell souvenirs for a reasonnable price .
Dear Paul ,
It was great you hear from you .
I 'm sorry I haven't written sooner , but I was still very busy .
As you know I enjoyed helping at a concert last week .
It was really exhausting , but illuminating experience .
It was a charity concert , the income of which was intended for children who suffer from cancer .
The main task of the volunteers was to collect money .
I sold tickets before the concert , and then , during the concert , I helped take care of security .
It was a truly amazing event .
We tried to make everyone had fun .
There were many visitors from other countries , so we often had to translate the conversation and help in communication .
Everything was new to me and very exciting .
But the most memorable was a meeting with the stars of the concert .
They are really great people who want to help others , without pay .
Apart from that , everything 's fine here in Poland .
Do n't forget that you 're always welcome to come and stay- I 'd love to see you , and we can take part in a similar event , as a volunteer , together .
Anyway , I must go now .
Write soon and tell me how you 're getting on .
Lots of Love .
Jane .
Dear friend ,

Old school dance .
Dancing is something that human beings always did , in one way or another .
Therefore , I do n't feel embarrassed to admit that I love ballet .
Even if there are a lot of variants , I prefer classical ballet .
Since I was a child I wanted to learn how ballerinas could dance so graciously .
On the other hand , I always loved classical music .
For me it was the perfect combination .
Luckily , we got a word of a dancing school .
That , by chance , happen to be near my town .
I spent four years doing one of the things I love the most , dancing .
Sadly , things do n't always work out the way we expect .
Just as my enthusiasm for ballet thrived , my grades in school kept falling .
Consequently , I had to leave .
There are some things you should take into consideration if you want to try this sport .
Ballet requires a lot of time and effort .
It 's not only a physical sport , you really need to get your mind into it .
Furthermore , ballet is expensive . Supposing that this type of dance is n't a tradition in your country , prepare to open your wallet .
This is a short story written by D. B. Caulfield , the big brother of Holden Caulfield who is the main character in The Catcher in the Rye from J. D. Salinger .
Some of the selected aspects for this assignment were the characteristics that Holden says he likes in others of his favorite books since this is one of them .
D. B. Caulfield is a writer and he used to write short stories , including a book of short stories titled The Secret Goldfish , in which you can find Holden 's favorite one , The Secret Goldfish .
Holden tells us that his brother is now writing for Hollywood .
He does not like that his brother is " prostituting himself " by writing scripts for movies since he does not like movies .
The purpose of this assignment is to explore the possible short story D. B. wrote and that Holden liked so much .
This was achieved by using as a reference the information that Holden gives us about this short story and including things in it that he might like .
After giving instructions for stage three , I was busy checking the register . I did n't monitor Ss for the first four minutes .
As a result , I found two Ss opening their booklets and reading the original text to copy the sentences .
I was lucky to notice that and I made it clear to the whole class that they should n't open their booklets .
Also , Ss were writing the sentences individually in their notebook instead of choosing only one person to write for the whole team .
I actually had to stop the whole class and ask them to nominate one person to write for the whole group .
I also noticed that one team is not writing anything .
When I approached them , they said they ca n't remember the exact words that were dictated .
Another team used the words to make sentences that are unrelated to the story .
Ss could hardly hear each other well because of the rectangular layout of the room .
The chairs were placed in a U shape which made it difficult for team members to discuss their ideas and to maintain eye contact .
Additionally , one team had finished reconstructing their story while other teams needed more time to finish the task .
I forgot to prepare extra materials for fast finishers .
I was lucky to remember the word search at the end of the booklet , so I asked them to do it in pairs .
I also forgot to set the time for the activity .
Ss did n't know how much time they have to finish the task .
As a result , one team only finished half of the sentences .
Dear Paul ,
When I agreed to go and help out at the concert , it was no mistake to do so .
I enjoyed every aspect of the experience : the people , the music , the atmosphere , ... When I first arrived at that building , I could not find the entrance .
Then one of the band members and some early visitors came along and took me to the other side of the street into a pub .
From the corridor an underground pathway led to the basement of the strange building opposite .
It is still a mystery to me how so many people managed to find their way inside , but when we were in the concert hall at last , hundreds were there already and people were obviously laughing about the fact that the main entrance had magically disappeared .
The atmosphere was really nice ; the people were so light - hearted and I just felt like I could be friends with anyone immediately .
Of course , I originally came there to work : putting the chairs and tables right , ensuring that everyone in my appointed space was well - fed , and keeping an eye on the cash counter .
But for the greatest part I was able to just listen to the music and sing along with the jovial guys leaning against the bar .
But I realise now that it 's quite late already and that I ought to sleep . I 'll write the rest to you as soon as I can ; I haven't told to the best part yet !
See you soon ,
Greets

Way Forward
5.1 .
Raising the academic performance of Students
The principal is dedicated to developing a favourable learning environment .
Given the learning experiences in the past two year 's school - based support , some sound teaching strategies have been developed and these include the provision of adequate language inputs , ELPS and Thinking Tools .
All of the above have been taken a good progress in developing P.1 - 4 school - based mathematics curriculum while there is still an area for developing in P.5 & 6 mathematics curriculum .
In view of these favourable conditions , higher expectations could be set to improve the learning progress and enhance the learning performance of NCS .
The improvement of TSA results and internal results celebrated the success of teachers ' efforts .
More collaborative efforts should be paid to make use of the sound teaching strategies with the aim of improving the learning performance of NCS .
5.2 . Sustaining capacity building through CLP
Given the experiences gained in the support services , many mathematics teachers have been equipped with necessary skills in identifying the learning needs of students and developing effective strategies for teaching NCS .
The school could consider stepping up collaborative efforts in developing coherence in curriculum development .
The CLP could be further adopted as a vehicle to identify the learning needs of students and to build capacity of teachers .
More professional opportunities could be purposefully arranged to explore some effective strategies and promote discussion among teachers .
Sharing among teachers could be encouraged to understand the learning of NCS .
Technology plays a key role in our modern lives .
Nowadays , with the development of genetics , we might be able to stop world famine .
The research done in this field has provided new mechanisms that give the impression of being an alternative to yield the necessary amount of crops for humans , unfortunately , there is no evidence of GMC 's being completely safe for human consumption .
It might be a cause of concern that all the research done has been under the command of private corporations that deny full access to experiment reports , leaving a cluster of questions without any answer .
Companies as Monsanto that engineers plants with steeril seeds , encourage non - sustainable production models that promote the extinction of independent farmers who have to choose between their lifestyle and the new farming era .
According to an article published by UNAM in 2001 , the introduction of GMC 's has had a huge impact on the global market .
The Monopolistic and monopsonic features shown in GMC companies establish that the research done in this field has nothing to do either with science or with technology and even less with the global food security .
The usage of genetically modified crops has proven to be dangerous for humans as well as for the environment .
In their quest for the perfect seed , genetic engineers have strengthened crops that are destroying the seeds biodiversity , as stand by a research led by Greenpeace , GMC crops are threatening to human health because they present more toxic traces than non - modified crops .
Consequently , we must be careful with the decisions we make .
It is worth mentioning that we never know the impact that scientific research and harvesting techniques are going to have over our lives , but the fate of those improvements depends on the application that humans give them .
In conclusion , I would rather say that companies must reinforce our humanity before manipulating the environment in such a radical manner .
ENGLISH - LANGUAGE TV PROGRAMMES IN ITALY .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to analyse and assess the impact of English - language television programmes on Italian culture and to make suitable recommendations .
Popularity of English - language TV programmes
The presence on electronic devices of English - language TV programmes is becoming more and more prominent .
A survey was carried out in the most populated Italian cities and 2000 citizens were interviewed on 22nd October to quantify their interest in such segment of the national TV schedule with the following results :
• 40% of those interviewed , most of which have proven to be young people , declared they watch English - language TV programmes at least five times a week ;
• 30% of them stated they watch them at most twice a week , but they would so more often if they were subtitled ;
• 30% of them said they never watch them .
People enjoy listening to the original audio , which entails realism and naturalness .
Besides , avoiding the dubbing process , episodes can be seen in concert with their original airing .
Impact on local culture
Although the importation of such programmes has produced positive effects , such as the introduction of new perspectives on different aspects of life , it has also produced negative outcomes .
Italian companies must face the challenge set by the market demand due to the importation of many foreign traditions .
Recommendations
It is highly recommended that the government should provide adequate financial support to traditional small businesses .
I would therefore suggest that local products be protected and valorised , to be able to reply to the threat represented by low price imported ones .
One intelligent person once said : ' The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page . '
I totally agree with this statement and , to my mind , people should travel a lot because our world is incredible .
But there is one more question : travel by car or public transport ?
First of all , of course , travelling by car is much more convenient than , for example , by bus .
You can drive wherever and whenever you want .
Even just in cities , let it alone travelling at long distances .
But , on the other hand , traffic jam or bad weather can make our trip inconvenient .
Moreover , there are not many parking places in big cities .
Secondly , travelling by public transport is much cheaper .
Not all people can afford travelling by car every day so they choose public transport .
Thirdly , we should take care of our environment !
Cars pollute our air what leads to many diseases such as asthma , allergy and even cancer .
Moreover , cars release poisonous exhaust fumes and chemicals into the air , which mix with the water in the clouds , and the polluted rain , which later falls , damages trees , lakes and buildings .
So , my advice is to travel by bicycle ( at least , use public transport ) because it is environmentally friendly !
Summary of the article " Business à la française " which was written by Simon Kuper .
By Arno Brodeur , student number 1234567 , class ABCD1EF .
The difference in work meetings between the British and France are that the British want to make decisions and the France way more like a debate , as is written in a guide for Franco - British business relationships .
The opinion of Simon Kuper is that the main reason for the misunderstandings are different languages .
This in contrast to the guide " Light at the End of the Tunnel : Practical Reflections on the French and British in Business " published by the French chamber of commerce in Great Britain .
The by the UK 's Foreign Office in 1944 published booklet " instructions for British Serviceman in France " is still useful for the most , nowadays .
The late actor Louis de Funès is mentioned as a role model by the chamber of commerce 's guide .
When you get hired by a British employer it will be because of your experience or achievements as a leader in sports .
In France the level of education is the main reason for hiring someone .
British does n't speak out what they are thinking , in contrast to the Dutch .
The chamber 's guide was written by business men and women who were familiar with the habits of both countries .
Something to remember is that people allow each other their own national habits , up to a certain point .
In 1995 the French came to notice that their languish was n't enough for doing business worldwide .
This is one of the reasons why most French under 50 does n't speak English very well .
International relationships are built by people who can speak the same languish and who are at the same level of their vocabulary .
The native speakers seek each other out , the British come together with the Americans and the French well … they are on their own .
If the French and British spoke the same languish evenly , the trade would go up by 44 per cent .
It 's no use to teach French on schools , because the French only except near native speakers .
It 's better to talk British and force it on them .
« I 'm 22 years old and my name is Daniel .
I live in a small town called Grycksbo and I 've been part of Unga Kris volunteering programs since the summer 2010 .
At first , I joined Unga KRIS and started volunteering to have fun and meet new people .
Now that I have been volunteering for a while , my expectations have changed : Unga KRIS is still a place where I expect to have fun and meet new people but I also expect to grow even more as a person , to take on responsibilities and face my fears in different social situation . »
I choose this topic because I think volunteer work is important .
Volunteer work provides an organization with free resources to help it achieve goals .
In many cases , volunteers are crucial to help maintain life , as when meals are delivered to homebound people .
Sometimes volunteer work , such as renovating a playground , benefits the broader community .
And while volunteer work is important for the individuals and communities served , it also benefits the volunteer .
I have already done volunteer work and it 's something I want to do again .
It 's something that makes part of our grow to adulthood .
When I was nineteen , I started and ran my own business , for me , was one of the most exciting choices that I made .
Of course , without the full support of my family I could n't have done it .
At first , I found it as an exhilarating and rewarding challenge , although it was a modest shop .
In fact , I was responsible and I had the determination and the skills , because I learned it from my parents .
But it was n't enough , the fact of the matter was that I ignored that being self- employed entailed self - sacrifice , devoting my time , energies and a great deal of patience with the customers , it was so hard!.
Things gradually improved day by day for a time and my reneues stated growing .
So I did n't mind working against time and long hours .
I got used to it .
I was very ambitious !
During the next ten years , I was thrilled about the fact to put aside in order to build our flat step by step .
When I got married , things quickly went from bad to worse because I had to work at two shifts , at home and the shop .
It was exhausting ! !
Introduction
The aim of this report is to examine the possibility of hosting the European football championship in my country .
This report outlines the benefits and the possible objections .
Location
As a matter of fact Budapest , the capital city of Hungary can be a very good competitor for hosting this sporting event .
The river Danube divides Budapest into two parts .
Margit Island is a favourite destination for runners and lovers .
The island boasts fresh air and clear parks .
Buda castle is an impressive ancient picturesque building and attractive tourist location .
Transportation system
Regardless of the mode of transport , fares are very affordable .
The transportation system is effective .
The obsolete trams and trolleys had been replaced .
The underground system can ease congestion .
Bicycle trails can criss - cross the city .
You can rent bikes .
Facilities
1 . )
Puskás Ferenc stadium has ample seats for the spectators .
It is suitable for 68976 people .
2 . ) Airport Hotel is the most adjacent accommodation to the Liszt Ferenc airport .
This inexpensive hotel has 112 rooms .
3 . ) Le Meridien is set in the city 's fashionable business hub .
The luxurious hotel has 218 rooms .
Cultural Life
The flourishing cultural life will fascinate visitors .
The admission 's tickets to the most of Budapest 's museums are comparatively cheap .
I recommend the Hungarian National Museum .
Objections
The main concern is related to petty crime , especially the pickpocketing .
In addition , the homeless people have to sleep in the street .
Suggestions
Old historical buildings are in disrepair .
The government should renovate the buildings which would be a great shelter for homeless people .
The police chief should reinforce their patrol officers to tackle the crime .
In conclusion it would be a good idea and a viable way through sponsorships .
Moreover , this would be advantageous both for hosting city and the tourists .
It happened in May 2008 .
I had just graduated the Academy and was on my summer holidays .
I was looking for a job .
By that time I had visited six interviews , but nobody was interested in my candidacy .
I was a little bit sad , because all my friends had already found a job .
I decided to go to my parents and spend a few weeks helping them with a renovation of their house .
It was the third day of my visit .
I was painting the front wall of the house when a postman came .
He brought a letter for me .
I was surprised because all my friends knew that I had n't been living at my parents ' house .
I opened the envelope and found in it an offer of employment .
At first I did not understand anything and I had decided that it was a mistake .
But then I remembered when I was 15 I 've sent my scientific work to the Patent service .
It turned out that they send my work to a few Instituts and one of them was interested in me .
That day was a start of my scientific career .
Our life - 50 years from now
Most people think that in 50 years ' time , we will have used up all the Earth 's natural resources .
They say that the Earth 's population will need to find and colonise two planets as our forests and fresh water supplies will vanish .
Of course , all of this is unrealistic .
It 'll be impossible for people to live on other planets in 50 years ' time .
Technology wo n't have been advanced enough by that time .
But it 's not entirely impossible .
There is a little truth and possibility in it .
In 50 years ' time , maybe not all of the natural resources will have been used up , but most of it then will have been exploited .
Mankind will have found other energy sources , similar to wind powered energy , solar energy and water powered energy .
Maybe they will be using atoms or hydrogen , since hydrogen is all around us and it 's very powerful .
I 'm completely sure that 50 years from now we will still be living on Earth , although our life styles will have changed a lot .
Many young students who have finished their secondary education wonder whether they should take a year off before they make the most important decision about which university course they find suitable for their future .
So , is it really worth it getting away from it all and setting off on a journey around the world or taking their first job ?
On the one hand , there are many students who strongly believe that having a break for quite a long time is a waste of time .
Firstly , most teenagers who are against this idea are convinced that the university course they have chosen will be the future career in their lives .
Moreover , they feel they have to make the most of their time to become a university graduate and get a life in what they really love .
Conversely , there are many teenagers who need to take their time and see much of what the world has to offer them .
Therefore , they choose a job that is related to a hobby or sport so that they can learn from and earn money at the same time .
Others , by contrast , choose a country or trace an itinerary to travel to the place of their dreams and set off to live new experiences .
To my mind , gaining experience of any kind and taking a year gap before plunging into applying for a university course will broaden young people 's perspective to life and will help them become more confident with what they really love .
Luckily enough , they may end up working in another country or their hobby could become their career .
I learned somewhere that the best thing to make a path through your writing is to start tipping .
I 'm not sure if this is true or wrong , because simply I 'm not here to judge or comment on the authenticity of the statement , but rather , I 'm here to make my path through writing .
What is a path through writing ?
How can one know they got the talent ?
How can one know they have the guts ? what I believe , and think it 's true , is that braveness , boldness as well as callousness make people write truly what they think , without any lies , without any camouflage and without any kind of burnished layers .
Writers often make their masterpieces shiny and glowing in order to make it more acceptable by people , less shocking to them and less close to the reality from which readers had the intention to escape when they have picked that piece of writing in the first place .
People hold different views about the causes of crime .
While some people argue that bad human nature is the reason , it is undeniable that social problems and indigence are responsible for the proliferation of wrongdoings .
To begin with , it is true that humans are often born with greed and selfishness .
For example , it is not difficult to see the media talking about a son who kills his parents for money or a girl who is murdered by her boyfriend out of rage due to jealousy .
These crimes may be committed by sensible people who are not able to control themselves at crucial times .
Thus , bad natural personality can be the seed of crime .
On the other hand , I would argue that poverty can be the major catalyst for illegality .
It means that a number of law offenders can not sustain their livelihood , and they desperately experience limited options to earn money .
As a result , they are easily drawn by the allure of wealth , which leads to illegal activities such as theft , kidnapping or drug trafficking .
Big cities such as Hanoi or New Delhi witness a growth in juvenile delinquency which mostly stems from rural and underdeveloped areas .
The proliferation of these crimes undoubtedly has a negative effect on the city 's life .
In addition , the prevalence of social media such as television or the internet is partially to blame .
The effect of adult movies on the Internet can cause offence such as rape .
Also , films and video games containing violent scenes can stimulate audiences to imitate those acts and commit crimes .
This is particularly common among young people who are unable to differentiate between fiction and reality .
In conclusion , although human nature is likely to be a cause of crime , I hold the position that crime occur due to social media and poverty .
In the past people used technology as a tool for making survival an easier endeavor .
Nowadays we are witnessing a shift in the role technology is playing in our society and may continue to play for generations to come .
In the modern - day world technology is no longer a tool for survival but it turned to a means of communication and entertainment .
Mass communication technology has made it easier than ever to connect with people .
At the same time this raises the concern of whether technology has a good or bad influence on our society , is the use of technology destroying face - to - face interaction and communication between people ?
Whenever you 're in a coffee shop , standing at a bus stop or taking the tube you can easily see how people are connected to each other using different sorts of electronic devices .
The primary concern regarding this new communication behavior is whether it made face - to - face interaction and communication between people nonexistent .
This is true in many aspects as this may lead to living in a virtual world that only includes interacting with people with texting and social networks .
This leads , among other things , to the ability for people to be lonely , as having too many virtual friendships causes the inability to establish meaningful relationships .
The young generations in our society are participating in a massive , unintentional social experiment the results of which are not entirely predictable .
Nowadays , society tends to prejudge others just because of their actions and without knowing the real motive of the behaviour .
But with Colton 's quotation , we can clearly see that it has happened since years .
I personally believe that imitation is just the sincerest form of admiration .
In our current society we can see it daily .
Lot of children got their hair cut as their favourite football players , others dress like their favourite actors and actresses or even adults act as their role model , just because they all do have something in common : they admire those people .
Flattering is different , it is easier to recognize .
If someone depends on you and s / he is constantly paying attention to you and being , in a colloquial way , a " brown nose " , you notice and become aware of it quickly .
Just because of their attitude and aptitude , their behaviour … simply in the way they act , we can see their intentions .
Nowadays , in some determinate cases , people when they pretend to get a good position or be promoted , they flatter .
And we can see these examples in many situations , when we find inept and incompetent workers .
When acceding to these jobs is not through civil service exams , I think there are only two ways : influences or flattery ; and to be honest I do n't know what I prefer .
To sum up , I would like to invite people who agree with the quotation , to rethink their opinion because everything is not what it seems to be .
I ca n't think of any one reason why I want to be a surgeon .
But I can think of a thousand reasons why I should quit .
They make it hard on purpose .
There are lives in our hands .
There comes a moment when it 's more than just a game .
And you either take that step forward , or turn around and walk away . I could quit .
But here 's the thing : I love the playing field .
It 's all about lines .
The finish line at the end of residency , waiting in line for a chance at the operating table , and then , there 's the most important line .
The line separating you from the people you work with .
It does n't help to get too familiar .
To make friends .
You need boundaries between you and the rest of the world .
Other people are far too messy .
It 's all about lines .
Drawing lines in the sand , and praying like hell no one crosses them .
But there are some lines ... that are way too dangerous to cross .
But here 's what I know .
If you 're willing to take the chance ... the view from the other side is spectacular .
There 's another way to survive this competition .
A way that no one ever seems to tells you about .
( Meredith is leaving for the day .
She sees Viper with his friends and they smile at each other ) One you have to learn for yourself .
Number five : it 's not about the race at all .
There are no winners or losers .
Victories are counted by the number of lives saved .
And once in a while , if you 're smart , the life you save could be your own .
I am really interested in martial arts , such as Aikido , Judo and self - defense that I have already practiced .
There are some that do not need too much forces and strengths , such as Thai chi and others that need more like Karate , Judo , and so .
These kinds of sports have some advantages and disadvantages .
the First advantage of martial arts is to improve self - confidence .
When you practise martial arts , you learn how to protect yourself against any sudden attack .
You will get ready to fight with others , regardless their strengths , ages and so on .
When you do a technique successfully on your opponent , you feel more confidence .
Second advantage of doing martial arts is how to respect others .
Every time , you do a technique you have to show your respect to opponent , and also other ranks , regardless to their age .
Third one is movement and coordination between different parts of body ; eyes , hands and legs .
When you do a technique or defense against a technique , you control your body 's movement and coordinate them to work in the same time .
Some people think there are some disadvantages like injury , and getting aggressive .
According to studies , martial arts have fewer injuries than other sports like soccer .
People who practise martial arts are less aggressive because they practice to control their inner energy , and also to respect .
I suggest that everyone should try martial sports .
But before starting , you supposed to evaluate your needs and your health condition .
And when you are starting , follow the discipline and find the ideas and thoughts that are hidden behind the movements and techniques .
In the other words , try to understand the philosophy of the sports before learning the techniques .
Last night I had the opportunity to attend a marvelous play based on the book " Alice in Wonderland " which was enthusiastically received by both adults and children .
The original work was written by the mathematical , logical and British writer Lewis Carroll .
The wonderland that is described in the book is created through logic games , and , therefore , it is understandable the success it has achieved in the most varied environments .
The exceptional play that we saw yesterday features all the iconic characters adapted to some extent adapted to the present time , such as , the White Rabbit , Mad Hatter , the blue caterpillar or the Queen of Hearts .
One of the biggest differences with the book is the atmosphere created on stage and the characterization of the characters .
The only negative comment I could make is that you do not have the possibility to let your imagination in the same way that when you read the book .
However , I strongly recommend going to see this play because it has a great appeal to both adults and children .
Like what was once , I have no doubt that this world of wonders will remain important in the coming years .
Rationale :
" Encourage learner autonomy - the teacher wo n't always be there to provide answers " Alternatives to whole class feedback onestopenglish .
This lesson was the third trail of giving students written instructions and having them explain to the classmates what activities need to be done .
This time in order to further reduce my TTT I handed over the correction of activities to the students as well .
I hope by handing over the complete control to the class this would give them more chance to practice real world discussion and negation . techniques
The amount of talking done by the students was more that pleasing .
They enjoyed being the"boss " and giving telling other students what to do .
I had an exact copy of what the students had on their clue cards on a separate piece of paper this time rather than in the lesson plan its self .
This made every thing seem less cluttered and more manageable .
I highlighted anything that required an action from me on my copy of the clues e.g. handing a student the answers to an exercise .
Giving the students the answers the exercises was a partially efficient way to encourage the students to speak more .
I found that the class challenged the student who had the answers , if they had written down something different .
I found that they challenged each other more than they ever do me .
This method made the class lively and gave the students a chance to really defend their points of view .
They used a lot of language that they would be able to use in everyday discussions ( arguments ) outside of the classroom .
This is the first time I have tired this method and I neglected to leave the students extra time to be able to benefit fully from the exercise .
The enjoyed the exercise so much that my timing was completely off .
I decided to cut an exercise in order to let the students continue their discussions .
In heinz sight giving this much control to the class and introducing a new and tricky grammar point ( past modals ) was not the best choice .
Insights for future lessons :
The next time I do this lesson I would use a more skills based lesson with perhaps a listening or a short reading .
If grammar was part of the lesson It would need to be a point that is being revised .
Despite having timing issues , I feel that thus far this was the class with the most natural student participation and the lowest amount of TTT .
I throughly enjoyed the lesson and according to student feedback , so did they .
Last year , I visited one of the most historic and famous cities in the world , Rome , a city where you can find a country inside it .
It 's a city where you can recreate a part of the European history , thanks to the ancient and magnificent building , and where you can enjoy the last technologies and have fun .
I do love the city , and I hope you also like it .
I suggest visitin the Vatican , as I said at the beginning ; the county inside the city .
It 's a huge , historic and imposing building .
Inside it , we can find the well known sistine chapel , I ca n't tell you how it is , because last year when I went , there was a changeover of pope , and it was closed and I could n't entry .
On the other hand , there are more places to visit , as the Coliseum or something else .
Whatever happens , I 'm sure , you 'll enjoy the city .
With regard to the weather , I went in March , and it was a little cool for my taste and it rained , so if I were you , I would go a few months later .
Furthermore , if you go in summer , you should go to a lively area and be with the interesting and nice people , but like every city , be careful with the rough areas .
Despite the people 's opinions , if you have the opportunity to go , do n't throw it away , and check it for yourself .
FRIENDSHIP TODAY
As the majority of you I have friends who are still around me since many years ago although we do n't see each other regularly , others simply have softly become less important and some luckily have recently entered my life .
At some point , all of us have benefited enormously from a real friendship .
With any doubt a good friend is a treasure .
Counting on someone capable of understanding your demands , who shares with you the innermost feelings and who is able of discussing possible misunderstandings , is totally rewarding .
As the saying goes " A friend in need is a friend indeed " .
Nevertheless , a friendship depends largely on sincerity and empathy .
If you respect your friends then they will respect you .
In other words , no matter how far you live , a good friend will always support to you .
Curiously , you never know where will you find a friend and every stage of your life brings you the opportunity to take advantage of new people who maybe attends to the same sport lessons than you or simply work in the same company .
It is surprising the amount of nice people next to you sometimes , and it is a question of spending some time to realize that you have now new friends .
As I said before every moment in your life is different as your friends probably are too .
Dear Amal ,
Hi!How are you ? Have you found your car keys ?
Or has it ran away ?
I wanted to write to you earlier , but we had my sisters ' birthday party and I had an allergic reaction from something I 've never eaten before .
At first we did n't know what was it from , then I realized that the cake had blue berries , and I 've never eaten one before .
After we ate the cake , I found my mom looking at me an screaming:"Oh !
What 's that ! ?
" , then I found everyone staring at me .
Some only stared , some screamed , and the others laughed at me , the people who were screaming , and who were staring .
I did n't know was happening , and why they were acting like this .
Suddenly I felt my whole body itching me , mom took me upstairs .
When I looked at the mirror , my face was spotted with red spots and it kind of turned purple , when I looked at my hands and my arms , it was all red from my fingers when I was scratching them , and the parts that were n't red , they were spotted like my face .
Anyways , mom gave me a medicine(I do n't know what it is ) , and a cream for my arms and hands because they were turning blue .
But , thanks to mom , I feel much better now .
And do n't be afraid , I 'm okay , and I decided to check on everything from blue berries .
Hope to hear from you soon .
yours ,
Zahraa .
How is the experience of learning another language ?
The learning of our mother tongue language is a long term process that everyone has to be involved in .
However , who is skilled in speaking a foreign language has a huge advantage in a competitive and worldwide society .
I had the opportunity to have different language classes , such as English , French and Spanish .
On the one hand , I have been learning English for so long that my good profeciency have given me the chance to get a position in an international work team .
On the other hand , I have learned French and Spanish just for a few months , because I was curious to learn the oficial language of the countries , where friends and relatives are living in .
I am only able to read simple worksheets and to make a brief presentation about me .
As a student of these classes , especially , of English ; I realized that , although the classes were important , a systematic language practice was essential for reaching an advanced level and , moreover , for maintaining it .
Therefore , the hardest task of learning another language is to keep a high level of motivation to work on it and to pay for it .
Nevertheless , learning another language has many benefits , such as the ability in living and visiting countries with different languages , meeting foreign people , working in an international environment , reading books or websites in other languages , etc .
Thus , I suggest that everyone learn another language , in order to be a citizen , not of a country , but of the world .
The RUBBERNECKER novel review by Marian Greco
Bauer 's fourth novel is an originally surprising thriller which includes an astonishing view of Aspergen syndrome from the prospective of Patrick , a trainee medicine student .
With the tender age of 18 and coping with his eccentric social code and all the possible courage , Patrick moves from his mother 's house to a rented flat in Cardiff to pursue his greatest dream , work in the Anatomy Department at Cardiff University .
The writer lets us observe the fear , anxiety and the defenceslessness of Sam , a neurological patient who is just beginning to emerge from its comatose state and has yet to deal with the reality of his new situation , sorting out pieces of memories involving relatives and not quite understanding why a woman he does n't know anything about claims to be his wife .
Patrick performances brilliantly the autopsy of Sam and finds out shocking information which leads the reader to the discovery of tragic and incidental deaths of neurological patients involving all at once doctors , nurses and patient 's relatives .
In this task , Patrick will be helped out by Lexi , the daughter of his autopsy corpse , to throw some light out of the creepy suspicion of medical mistreatment and their darkest consequences .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
It was too late and the others were n't coming , the sun was setting and looking for them was n't an option .
They had to think , and they had to do it quickly because those things , the things that came out at night , were growing stronger and stronger .
Everything started with some attacks here and there but no one really knew what was happening , so the attacks were tagged as " animal attacks " .
But when they became more frequent and witnesses described huge , flurry , dark and terrifying creatures with blood - shot eyes , panic grew over the population .
Government authorities told people to stay calm and a curfew was established , but Peter was on the camping holiday with his best friends and only heard this when they met another group of people that , fortunately , had a radio .
They told them everything .
In order to be stronger in number , they befriended those people and helped each other .
The new group worked very well together but there was this girl he just could n't stand at all .
And now he was alone with her , waiting for the others to come back .
" It 's the end of the world , and I have to spend it with you ? " he whispered , the night had already fallen and they did n't want any unwanted visitors .
" Oh , shut up you delicate flower " said the girl . "
Get over it !
We will have to get along if we want to survive " .
Her words of wisdom left Peter stunned .

Dear Paul , you are right , it is really a brave step but you know how much is terrible the situation in Italy and I have decide to come to the UK to improve my cv as well .
My plan is simple , I want to make the best of this British experience by studying English and possibly by finding a little job .
By the way , if you can send me a list of job vacancies in your city it would be great .
At the moment I am struggling with the translation of my cv .
I am wondering if you could help me by giving me some tips to write a perfect cv , or at least acceptable .
I do not want to bother you but it would be fantastic .
In return for your help I could teach you some Italian recipes that I know you are fond of !
I have just found a cheap accommodation in a hostel which is very convenient to all the facilities .
Even though I am shy and I like my privacy , I think that during this experience it will be better to have contacts with foreign people to practise my spoken English as much as possible .
Now let 's talk about the good things .
The aim of this experience is also having fun and great time with you .
For example , what about going for some walks across the countryside or renting a bike ?
I know that the country is really lovely there .
Ok , I have told you everything and I really should finish packing !
Thank you in advance and I am looking forward to hearing from you .
All the best
Silvia
I am rather lazy as a person , I ca n't say I really enjoy sports in general but I definitely love walking .
I think it 's so effective : having a long walk on the green hills that surround my town , breathing deeply , enjoying the perfume of nature and the wonderful sights and colours of flowers and trees , it 's the best for me to clear my mind .
When it 's sunny , I love it even more if possible : the warm hug of the sun makes me feel loved , cuddled and so grateful for that .
There 's no special advice to give to somebody who wants to start this activity : if you aim doing something good for your health and for your mind , just wear comfortable clothes , put your pair of trainers on , choose the most inspiring place and just go and enjoy any minute of it .
You may want some nice music with you , so an Ipod is a handy solution to collect all your favourite songs and set up the perfect soundtrack to your walking activity .
I would recommend 30 min per day , to get the most of this activity : it does n't take too much of your spare time and you 'll get great benefits from it .
It 's very cheap as well : except for your jumpsuit and a pair of comfortable trainers , it does n't require any extra cost for technical or sophisticated equipment .
Dear Jo ,
Thank you for your email .
I 'm really happy that you are going to come to my country .
Actually , now I 'm staying in New Zealand , but I can give you some advice about travelling and working in Korea .
I think this is a very good experience to you because you can learn about another culture and people 's way of thinking .
So , I suggest you try to get a working holiday visa of Korea .
If you have that visa , you can travel and also work .
As you know , if you have normal tourism visa , you ca n't work .
In Korea , we have many kinds of work which is related to English , so you can get a job easliy .
Also , if you want to work more specific place such as electric company , public office and so on , you can apply to internship programme .
If you get the intership , you can work as a real businessman .
How long do you want to travel ?
Normally , summer is the best season for travelling .
We have lots of beautiful beaches and mountains .
In summer , you can enjoy many activities on the beach and also you can go hiking .
Especially , I strongly recommend you go to Jeju Island .
It is the most popular place that people want to go .
So , now I have to go back to work .
If you want to know more information about Korea , let me know and I do n't mind checking your plan to go Korea .
All the best ,
Yeeun
It was a winter night .
While most people stayed at home next to the fireplace , I was on the point of changing my life .
Not only was it going to change my life , but also other person 's life .
Suddenly , the streets of the village were witnesses of the dreadful crime .
Some days later , somebody knocked at the door .
When I opened , I was handcuffed straight away and I pretended to be surprised .
When we arrived at the police office , I met an officer called Michael .
He told me he was going to interview me . I had tried to get rid of the body .
Nevertheless , the police had found out the buried body .
Michael asked me where I had been at the time of the crime and I answered him that I had been at home having a rest with a friend who could bear out the alibi .
While the interview , I realised the different ways I would use to get away if I were alone .
Fortunately , Michael , who had n't thought that option , left the interrogation room .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Time was running out , he thought to himself .
Even now , as he stood in the doorway of this abandoned apartment building he knew that they may be hot on his trail .
With over two hundred thousand dollars in his bag he was a giant walking target .
He smiled , knowing that even the best laid plans crumble and was glad that he was taught to plan to police standards .
Peter began his slow dissent into the bowels of the building in front of him .
Ragged and worn , it certain had seen better days .
Graffiti covered the lower portions like a twisted skirt , doors missing , and windows gone .
His feet crunched on the unknown as he walked through the abandoned hallways .
Travelling farther down he found his destination , a small steep staircase covered in dust and shrouded in a mist like fog .
Peter 's head jerked around as the first signs of his crime came to light .
A police officers car was zooming in his direction , sirens blaring .
Now running , Peter soon found himself on the top floor .
His panting turned into a magnificent grin as he looked out the window and saw a black helicopter heading in his direction .
Home free , he thought to himself .
To begin with , I think that most people use their car to go to work and also when they go on holiday o to move themselves around the city or town because they feel free and do n't have to pay attention to the timetable .
Besides , public transport is very crowded with people at peak hours .
But , on the other hand , when they travel abroad , it 's easier to take a train o a plane because you arrive faster and you need n't find a place to park your car and if you want to go somewhere you can take a taxi or a bus or even the underground .
In conclusion , from my point of view , if you are in your own town or city , you use your car more often than when you are visiting another country and seeing the sights .
Anyway , I do n't think public transport has no future , but public transport is used on different occasions from before and when you go to a place you know you wo n't be able to find a place to park and you ca n't waste time looking for where to park .
This diagram illustrates the complete process of note - making .
To make bank notes , the first step is to properly design it .
While background color and art work are thoroughly considered , security issues are one thing that we can not over look either .
After this , metal plates need to be prepared by skilled machinists so as to proceed to bank notes printing , in which stage sheets are used to print ( each containing 50 bank notes ) .
Also , special ink is printed on both side of the sheet and the images are slightly raised .
Then comes the most important stage -- inspection .
In this step , workers are needed to manually inspect the quality of sheets and divide them into three groups : good quality , partially damaged quality and bad quality .
Sheets in the second groups then get seperated into good ones , which , together with good quality sheets , enter a process of packaging and distribution where seperate notes are cut and finally enter the market , and bad ones , which go to disposal with bad quality sheets , where both groups get securely destroyed .
This leads us to a conclusion that the process of bank notes creation is secure as well as simple .
My boyfriend .
My boyfriend is the best in all the entire round world .
He is my favourite person , and he always takes care of me .
His name is Jose and I love him with all my heart .
I met him two years ago in a party , and since that day my life has changed in many different ways .
When I first saw him I never imagined that I would love that stranger this way .
I have many memories with him , which I always keep on my heart even if they are god or bad .
One of them was the day we went to a concert of our favourite DJ , we had so much fun , we danced , kissed and sang like never before that night .
I love it .
That day is one of the memories I appreciate the most .
Now on days , we are still together , and we are as happy as in our beginning .
As a secret I can tell you that I want to marry him so badly , I swear to god that my life would be much better if I can live all of it with him .
Because I want him to be my daughter's / son 's dad , and to share an apartment with him , so we can buy our first Christmas tree as a couple with a real engagement , and spend every holiday , birthday , day , minute with him by my side .
I can finally just say that Jose is the most beautiful accident that has happened in my life .
He loves my family , my friends , my mistakes , my beauty , all myself from head to toe , and the most important thing , he loves me with all his heart .
I love him and I know that I always will .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
Danny .
Thank god for his existence in this world .
" It 's time for us to shine , " His handwritten words come to life in her mind .
She could distinctively hear his low , manly voice in her head .
His deep chuckles still made butterflies in her stomach .
Her mind wandered to the first moment she laid eyes on beautiful Danny .
She pursed her lips .
It was not an absolutely pleasant experience .
In fact , she was still cringing at that ugly thought .
Inhale .
The room was full of sweaty bodies .
They were moving in slow - motion .
Every movement seem to take a minute to execute .
Alison took a step forward and slammed into someone 's soaked t - shirt .
Disgusting .
Alison quickly wiped the remains of the person 's sweat with her hands .
Her lips curled in disgust .
" Excuse me ? " His voice boomed .
The person was holding her wrist , preventing her from wiping any sweat on her face .
She finally looked up .
Wide eyed , red lips , rosy cheeks , broad - build and a little stubble on his chin , he looked incredible .
She could n't help staring and realised his eyes were not the shade of any typical blue .
This blue eyes , were much darker with insecurity , doubt and mystery .
Her eyes gazed to his lips .
He must have applied some lip stick for it to be that red !
Alison swallowed her laughter inside her , knowing this was not the appropriate time to joke around .
" Excuse me ? " His voice boomed louder this time .
Exhale .
She opened her eyes .
She did not want to remember anything further on that night .
It was terrible but it was the only night she met Danny .
If that terrible night did not happen , what is happiness ?
What is hope ?
What is love ?
What is the point of living ?
She knows , she knows and she knows it is so wrong to put all happiness , dreams and hopes on someone that may leave anytime but she could not help it .
We need free books for our schools
This is an old petition .
Every year we waste money buying new books for our students .
We also waste paper in those books .
We do not need to go down that road again .
We can avoid repeating the same mistake again and again .
First of all , let me tell the adavantages .
They are obvious , nevertheless , I feel I should repeat them .
Each book can be used by more than one person .
Therefore , it is cheaper . We can save money and trees .
The former does not need any explanation .
The latter is going to be more important as time passes .
Next we could ask for help to our community . I have some books in my library I could donate .
I have them because I have paid for them , not for other particular reason .
I imagine I am not the only one who could donate books .
Last but not least , we could create an association that could be in charge of receiving books at the beginning .
Later , it could support other school initiatives .
In conclusion , we should provide free books to our students .
We must stop wasting our resources .

The streets were calmed and the lights were pleasant . Travelling at night was a pleasure in this town .
" So here we are " he said looking upward . "
We better do our exam as soon as we can "
They moved in the crowd that made several phone calls and talked about their busy life .
She looked around making faces at everyone around .
She made a complaint ; they were so annoying .
" You have to do your duty here too , remember ? We made a progress back in the other city "
She nooded and made another effort to look around .
Who could be ?
It was difficult to tell .
They needed someone who looked important or rich .
Someone who knew too much maybe .
" What about him ?
" She pointed at a man who was making a deal with another man .
As usual , they were talking about illegal things
" He will be our ticket to the main building and to the exam " he said .
They came closer to the man .
He was making preparations to make a huge deal with the other person .
The other person was n't convinced howewer .
They talked for hours one trying to convince the other , he was doing his best , but at the end , the other man declined .
When he finished talking he looked to the young couple in front of him
" What are you doing here pests ? !
" He made sure his voice was heard on the streets , to reafirm his social position .
The young couple grinned " You haven't heard about the mind hackers right ? "
They said in a delightful and evil tone .
He gasped and tried to scream but it was too late to run .
They controlled his mind .
She looked on her laptop , where all the information in that man 's mind was displayed
" Bingo . We got a code "
She made a note and wrote it down .
She inspected the man looking for an Id. She took it and as soon as they got it , they let the man go , who fainted and will not remember anything that happened to his mind .
The thief couple made their way to the main building .
The building was luxurious and covered by the most wonderful structures ever .
They entered the building with the aid of the ID and made use of the code to enter the interiors of the building .
They got with the receptionist
" Are you two the people who will make their skill test ? "
The couple nooded and showed the ID of the man from the other city .
The receptionist nooded and conducted both to the main hall .
What was inside was dangerous but fascinating .
They saw every register of the memories of people in that town .
It was disturbing as kids were also included .
The young couple continued forward until they reached him .
One of the bosses in charge of such thing .
She felt somehow nervous " I know we are doing this to escape this inferno but ... I have a bad feeling about this " but it was too late .
They made a decision and one of the bosses was in front of them .
They walked in to find a man looking through the window
" You two are finally here . I know who you are "
It was impossible they deleted every bit of information about themselves
" Did you think you two were going to make fun of me? ... "He pushed her backwards
" Welcome to your tombstone , hackers "
Yes .
Just how a coin has two sides , television too , has its pros and cons .
It offers unlimited entertainment as well as food for thought .
To quote an example , the prime minister of India recently launched a new channel called DD KISAN - the first television channel dedicated to farmers in India .
This would help the farmers to know the latest techniques and trends in agriculture and will also enable them to put across their queries to the concerned specialists in their field .
Off late , debates in news channels are the talk of the town where u get to know what is happening in your country or neighborhood .
Such programs also allows us to participate by giving our feedback .
Let 's take a look at our cartoon channels .
Gone are the days when tom mindlessly chased jerry .
presently we have many educational cartoons that teach kids how to draw , make crafts and even learn languages .
Hence , I conclude that television entertains as well as educates .
Home of the future will look more or less the same as the home of the present .
However , I believe that their functionality will change .
Even today processors are in almost every device : dishwashers , vacuum cleaners , television sets , even blenders .
So , how can we improve them ?
By hooking them up to the Internet .
It may sound silly , but I think it actually will make those devices more user friendly and functional .
Even now we can buy TV sets with Internet connection , so development of technology is not a problem .
But we have to ask ourselves why would we connect every device in our house to World Wide Web ?
The answer is :
remote control .
Imagine you can programme your house to welcome you after a long day at work .
You come back and dinner is cooked , all your favourite programmes are recorded and ready to watch , Your bath is full of hot water and you can just relax .
Reassuming , while design of houses may look different the most important change will be in technology which will make our life easier .
It has already done but we still ca n't see the end of possibilities .
Dear Sir / Madam ,

As for my personality , I would like to mention that I am a funny person who enjoys telling jokes , making people laugh and even getting dressed as a clown to entertain others .
Furthermore , I do not mind working long hours .
I hope my application will be taken into consideration .
If you require any further information , I am available for an on line interview .
Thank you in advance ,
Yours faithfully ,

It 's no secret that there has been a decline in the use of transport such as taxis ever since cars became more affordable and your common Joe became capable of sustaining one , two or more per family , however , does that really mean that the future of public transport like buses is hopeless ?
People are becoming more and more aware of the strain the carbon dioxide emissions of their cars put on the environment , and many municipalities have already outlawed the circulation of certain types of vehicles in given parts of their cities to reduce atmospheric pollution and improve the quality of its air .
Many affordable bus and metropolitan passes and other systems have also been created in order to motivate the citizens to use them , providing a quicker , and sometimes cheaper , alternative to their own transport .
The recent focus on public transport , along with the certain technological improvements and innovations that will follow it , are going to revitalize the public transport sector and hopefully make cities more eco - friendly .
He walked as fast as someone who knows the way .
Nothing was taking his attention .
His head was wandering around the sweet smile that made him feel nervous like a child just a few minutes ago .
It was n't only the smile , but the way she talked to him , the look in her eyes and her flirty attitude what had filled his stomach with tiny butterflies and , as he was going home , he started to realize the love running through his veins , right to the heart .
The voices in his head kept repeating : " Michael , you should have kissed her .
You do n't know if you will ever have another chance . "
On the other hand , his wife , his not - so - lovely wife , always angry and cold as ice , was waiting for him at home .
As Michael approached the house his feelings dropped down .
Was she alone ?
Why is that car parked right at his house 's door ?
Why are all the lights on ?
He picked up the keys from his pocket and approached carefully , holding his breath .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
If you are a fan of romantic films , you probably do n't like this movie . " Palmeras en la nieve " is a Spanish film based on a book written by Luz Gabas which is about the life of a Spanish man who goes to Bioko to work and he falls in love with a native woman .
The problem with this movie is not the story because the book is fantastic and when you read it , you really can feel the emotions to the characters .
So the problem for me is the way the movie is made , with several changes from the original script .
Furthermore , the main actors ' performance is not very good because they are not completely inside in their roles .
Although there are a lot of things which could be improved , not everything is bad in this movie !
An example of that it 's the extremely amazing soundtrack with a really beautiful song of Pablo Alboran , a Spanish singer .
Other good features are the customs and the landscapes which give to the movie a very realistic image and carry the spectators to that time
Dear Katy
I 'm really glad to hear from you !
It 's been a long time since we last contact each other .
So , you do n't know what to do with your promel , do you ?
Do n't worry , I 'll try to make it easy for you to decide which is the option that suits you best .
On the one hand , you 've been doing sport since you were seven years old and I understand it 's very important for you .
It 's an activity that you need to do every day , now that it 's a good way to keep fit .
However , as far as I 'm concerned , it 's not necessary to work out that much to be healthy .
As a matter of fact , you just have to eat a balanced diet and do sport twice or three times a week .
That way , you will be able to do sport as well as going to music classes .
On the other hand , you love playing piano and , in my opinion , you wo n't be able to keep it up if you give up music classes , as you do n't have any instruments at home .
Besides , I do n't think your parents would buy you a piano , since it would really annoy your neighbours .
Besides , as I have already said , you can exercise three or four hours a week instead of going every day to your training session .
As I see it , you could n't live without music even if you tried .
Now it 's your time to choose .
I hope my advice makes sense to you and that it helps with your decision .
Best of luck with your dilemma and do n't forget to write and tell me the outcome !
Love
Ariana
The majority of people think of sport as a way to relax , to get thin or to keep fit .
However , I see sport as a physical activity , where I constantly challenge myself to achieve better results .
It 's just like a competition when I practise sport .
My favourite sport is swimming . I can only practise it in my free time , as school keeps me very busy .
When I 'm able to , I go swimming twice a week for two hours each .
At least once a month , usually on Sundays , my friends and I hold a competition .
It is in these moments where I give it my all , and realize that all the pratice I had really paid off .
Swimming gives me a huge amount of satisfaction and so much desire to keep on challenging myself .
This is why I suggest people to give swimming a try .
Dear Editor ,
I am writing to inform you that the package holidays to Madrid you are currently advertising in your newspaper are apparently not what they claimed to be .
I believe you should be fully informed about the quality of the services in the advertisements you publish , as your readers could be negatively biassed towards your paper only due to such incidents .
Generally , the holiday as a whole was good enough as the most important -in my opinion- aspects , like the quality of the guided tours and the accommodation , was very high .
Nevertheless , there were many inaccuracies in the advertisement and certain aspects of the holiday were chaotic .
The fist day was a great shock to me as I realized I would be part of a group .
The tourist agency made group bookings , which resulted in the unusually low price of the holiday package .
Spending holidays with a group can be very convenient and for some people is the only way of travelling , but the advertisement did not state clearly that it concerned this particular type of holiday , which made me and some others feel deceived .
Another point of concern was transportation .
We had several problems , especially with the bus , which was often delayed and in one case it even caused us to miss a scheduled guided tour .
I believe there is plenty of room for improvement since , although the problems were not insuperable , they caused great inconvenience .
Firstly , a better transport agency should be found for the former difficulties to be prevented .
Secondly , advertisements should be clearer as it is very easy for someone to misunderstand them .
But the most important issue is the improvement of the general organization .
Much time lost could have been saved with a few phone calls , for example waiting for half an hour in a queue could have been prevented if a call had been made to the museum before we arrived there .
I assume that the tourist agency can think of better solutions than me , but I hope that my recommendations will be taken seriously .
Best Regards ,
There are six main characters Ross , Monica , Rachel , Chandler , Phoebe and Joey .
The setting is in New York and they meet daily in a bar called Central Perk .
Ross is Monica 's brother and he is deeply in love with Rachel .
On the other hand Joey and Chandler live together .
Joey is an actor and he is always making auditions without success .
And Chandler works in an office but he does n't really like his job .
Phoebe is the funniest of the group , she sings and plays the guitar but she is not very good at it .
Rachel and Monica have lived together since Rachel left her fiance on the altar .
Monica is her best friend !
She works in a restaurant as the head chef and she 's dating with a man twenty years older than her .
The six friends might not have the same opinion , they might argue , they might get angry with each other but they always forgive and forget !
In my opinion young people will love this show .
To sum up I really recommend you to see it , you 'll love it
The last film I saw was called " No Escape " .
It is the best movie I have ever seen ! You will be tense while watching the whole movie and I know it .
The events are really intense and they just keep getting more and more intense by the minute .
It also shows you the power of the family and how they should stick together through all the difficulties they face .
It also shows how you should always think of others before thinking of yourself .
I really recommend this movie , but if you plan watching it with your family , I do have to tell you that there is a lot of blood and killing in the film .
I can easily give it a five star rate because all of the events that happen seem real in the movie , and they are events that can happen in real life .
With no doubt all parents want their children to be citizen models .
However raising a child into a model citizen is extremely hard - working .
Some people think that this job should be done by the parents and others think unfairly that this is the teacher 's responsibility .
On one hand , parents should take responsibility on their children education as they are a child 's first contact .
Also , parents are like models to follow for their children , and as children do what they see they will copy their parents actions .
Indeed school is the first place where a children interacts with society .
However , they will talk or build a relationship based on what they see their parents doing with other people .
Ultimately , teachers may have different values from the ones of the parents .
On the other hand , parents may have lack of time to spend with their children due to demanding jobs and to provide everything that their children need , for example pay for their children school .
It can also be argued that children spend most of their time at school and not at home , making the school responsibility to pass good social values .
But it should not be forgotten , that parents have the most influence as they are models to follow .
To sum up , parents should take full responsibility for their children education .
However , one should take into account that a school with similar values to the ones of the parents would be a great help in the children raising process .
Dear Sir ,
I am writing in regard to the advertisement published by you , to work in summer camps in the USA .
I would like to take part in this experience during the summer , as I will have my summer brake during that period .
I have taken part in a volunteer programme , looking after children 6 - 12 during the school term , and therefore I consider myself as having a good knowledge of children 's behaviour , that might be useful for the summer camp .
During my apprenticeship , I was in charge of organising several activities , so I think I could do well at organising sports and activities .
Cooking has always been one of my favourite hobbies , and for this reason , I also would like to help in the kitchen activities .
I am a cheerful , energetic and hardworking person , and I am also a very responsible person , able to deal with small and medium groups of children , and for this reason I consider myself as suitable for the potition advertised .
I am looking forward to taking part in this project , and enrich my personal curriculum through the participation in this project .
Should you have further questions , do not hesitate to contact me at any time .
Looking forward to hearing from you , at your earliest convenience .
Restpectfully ,
Ana Cantú
Everything in this movie , Henri , is so simple and startling , but in the same time is hard to describe .
It tells the story of a widowed shop owner and a mentally handicapped girl .
As time passes by , the relationship has so many ups and downs , but with consistent love and caring it ends with a strong bond that is n't easily broken .
In France , where the film is made , they call the handicapped , " White Butterflies " , which is definitely a better nomenclature than " People With Special Needs " and so many dishonored names .
The only reason I want to recommend this movie to you is because I want you to forget about all the action , thrilling , money making or good fighting evil .
My sole purpose is to help you enjoy the little things in your lives , appreciate the life and its simplicity with all its hidden fun and sad parts as well .
Unlock the door toward a new life and kick off your journey toward a whole new group of characters .
chase the childish dream of visiting a foreign country and get to know new aspects of life .
Check out how ordinary people , just like you and me , live each and every day , share their grief and problems , join them with their happy moments , get involved in their lives and be passionate and compassionate .
Refresh your soul by getting involved in their special moments and get ready to make a change in your own life .
REPORT ON THE COURSE " Good design using DTP "
The aim of this report is to briefly describe the main strengths and weaknesses of the course " Good design using DTP " so as to give an overall view of it .
DESCRIPTION
The course took place in the Training center in Regent Street - London on the 14 - 15 of May , as scheduled .
All the participants , which were ten in total , were given a personal computer for the duration of the entire course in order to put into practice what was taught .
Furthermore , the organizers had carefully planned the whole course , including meals and beverages too .
ACHIEVEMENTS
The tutor , Will Reeves - a lecturer of the University of Cambridge , succeeded in covering the whole program in an extremely effective way .
To begin with , he focused on design considerations with DPT , explaining what software to use , and then he went on to tell us about typography and fonts , layout and balance as well as graphics and logs .
Therefore , he concluded the course by making color considerations and showing proofing and printing .
The highpoint , however , was the final practical exercises which gave us the opportunity to test our comprehension .
FAILURES
Despite the strengths mentioned above , there were also some areas that required some attention .
Not only was the venue inconvenient but it was also dirty .
The general dissatisfaction was perceived by the lecturer too , who pointed it out to the organizers who immediately started looking for an alternative venue .
In addition , in spite of having paid a lot , the participants were not allowed to take any materials away , and this resulted in obtaining a less effective result as the participants did n't have any materials to use to revise .
FINAL CONSIDERATIONS
To sum up , the course was generally successful , as the positive feedback received suggests .
In conclusion , we would definitely recommend it to anybody interested in this subject for both the quality of the course and the unquestionable preparation of the tutor .
Nowadays , many countries have been ruined areas of farmland , forest and wetland with the intention to construct housing and transport networks to cater to the demand of people .
There are many problems created by doing large - building projects , and it is the government 's responsibility to cope with these problems .
There are some unfavorable influence on people 's lives .
Because of the damage of farmland , forest and wetland , it is likely to lead to the pollution of water and air , which can cause the decrease of people 's living quality .
For example , in some areas , people have to wear a musk while having outdoor activities and they might need to purchase water from other towns .
As a result , their lifestyle can be negatively affect and thus they would feel less happy than other people lived in unpolluted areas .
The damage of habitats have affect animals in negative way .
They have to immigrate to another place since their homes are destroyed , and during the immigration most of them would die because of lack of water , high temperature or predators .
Besides , those animals who successfully arrive at proper place to live are likely to suffer from disease , because they did n't exposed to such a new environment before .
Although there are many people and animals are suffer from these problems , i do believe that the government can take some actions to solve them .
Firstly , laws should be set to forbid some projects which cause massive problems to the environment .
Secondly , it is necessary for the government to warn people the serious problems caused by constructing large - scale buildings .
To summarise , large - scale building projects create massive problems which are harmful to human and animals , but the government can be helpful in solving these problems
First of all , at the English course which I do at the HZ , I learned and improved my writing in many ways .
I would like to answer some questions from the guideline on Moodle , to explain how this course helped me to improve my English .
So , the first two questions are :
Has my writing improved and how did this happen ?
And the other questions : Which areas of my writing would I like to improve and did the free writing presentations helped me with my writing process ?
Secondly , has my writing improved and in what way did this happen then ?
From my point of view , my writing definitely has improved from the beginning of this school year till now .
I discovered that I know many more words than I thought and I can make well - structured sentences now , which I could n't do so well at the beginning of this school year .
This has to do with the technical grammatical features I learned in class as well .
The way I see it is that I learned to use cohesion in a correct way , which makes the paragraphs that I write more clear .
Besides that , I use cohesion which I did n't use before this course .
A few examples are : from my point of view and it seems to me .
Subsequently , I would like to answer the next two questions .
Which areas of my writing would I like to improve and did the free writing presentations helped me with my writing process ?
Although I believe that I already have improved my English since the beginning of the school year , I 'd like to improve my English vocabulary .
As I see it , the bigger the vocabulary , the better the writing process .
More words can be add in the article , so there can be a better explanation of the subject .
It 's my belief that the free writing presentations helped me with my writing process .
I learned a lot of new words during the presentations , which I used in my free writing .
To finish , I can conclude that this English course has been very useful to me , because it has improved my English very well .
The way I see it is that the grammatical features learned in English course , always can be used later on in life .
For example , when there have to be sent letters in English .
I agree with the given statement .
This is because all the people dream for a better future .
A better future means having good food to eat without worrying , good clothes to wear , a big property , a private means of transportation and many more .
Among them a private means of transportation suggests that there is no future for public transport .
It is already in practice in western world .
People from other parts of the world are also heading for the same dream .
Having own car or means of transportation is the dream of every individual including me .
A single car will not be enough for a family .
Private care per individual is needed .
It has also become a vital thing for life .
Whether to go to work or other places travelling in private vehicle is hassle free .
It saves lot of our time .
We can indulge in many things if we can manage time properly .
The trend of personal car is increasing rapidly .
So , I believe that there is no future for public transport .
We can not deny that there will be time when no person would like to travel by bus or train .
It is so much clear that private transport will overshadow the public vehicles .
Domestic violence
Everybody knows about the big problem that our society has , in terms of domestic abuse .
But most of us just from far ; we really do not imagine how this can affect people who suffer it .
Unfortunately , many people are damaged , not only physical but mentally and the worst is that violence destroys families and also involves their sons in the hell it causes .
Children quite often feel guilty of can not avoid these troubles or help their mothers to escape from them and tend to think they are doing something wrong when they obviously do not .
They are just the most sensitive and innocent victims of mistreatment .
It is very serious and hard to solve because victims have to be very strong and brave to recognize and face these situations and being able to report their aggressor so as to manage the matter finishes .
This is so difficult due to the fact that they usually feel stupid , miserable , hopeless and do not feel good about themselves .
Their aggressors make them become insecure and they think that they are alone .
Even , in most cases , they feel ashamed or afraid of these situations and prefer saying nothing to tell their truth .
All those people who are living this abuse have to know that they are really important and deserve to be happy and free and they are not alone .
There are many people who worry about and are willing to help and support them .
There is always someone who you can count on in your family , friends or associations , but you must ask for help .
We need to consider both sides of the argument for public transport use prior to reaching a conclusion .
Public transport is used for many reasons and can be convenient for different circumstances .
There are many reasons for using public transport , such as commuting in to the central business district .
This form of transport can be used to avoid delays due to traffic conditions and parking restrictions .
It can provide an opportunity for people to complete work during the journey .
Public transport may be the only option for individuals who do not drive or have access to a car .
It is more environmentally friendly because it has the potential to reduce the numbers of vehicles on the road .
However , the public transport use can be affected by a number of factors such as mechanical failures and environmental issues .
It may be expensive to use for some individuals and crowded during rush hours .
Using the car can be more flexible for some individuals .
A car can be useful for effective performance of many tasks .
It is easier to change routes when circumstances change unexpectedly .
However , a car can be expensive to maintain , park and fuel .
I think there is a role for both methods of transport after taking in to account all of the above reasons .
The reasons for use is dependent on the individual and the circumstances .
My favourite film of the last few months is " Scent of a woman " .
It 's one of the best Al Pacino 's films and it 's very different from previous ones .
First of all , in this film you do n't see a gangster Al Pacino , it 's about a retired army 's coonel who suffers from loneliness and depression .
It 's worth seeing because a young boy , Charlie , helps him get through his sadness in a very luxurious trip to New York .
One problem is that some scenes are too long , like the one in which they 're having dinner with the colonel 's family .
However , the drama is perfectly achieved in each scene and they keep you tied to the screen .
So , overall I strongly recommend it if you like redemption stories , and if you want to learn some pieces of advice for your life .
It 's certainly a good choice if you want to watch a DVD next Friday night .
The reading discusses the idea of how advance communication technologies give us an advantages of creating a 24/7 international working day and provides several reasons of support .
The professor , however , disagrees with points made in the article and explains that this system has its own disadvantages .
First point the professor addresses involves the reading 's assertion that creating two or three teams situated in different geographical locations will help reduce the work hours for each team and at the same time it will decrease the time frame of getting the project done .
The professor refutes this point of view by saying that based on his own experience this team work could be not so much beneficial .
For instance , some group could have questions , but it would not be able to ask the other group because they would sleep at that time .
Therefore , the working group will do its assumptions and may cause a waste of time .
Moreover , the group in California may do work in one way and a group in India do same work differently , so it will be challenging to bring both of them to the same way of getting things done .
Another point from the article that the professor opposes is the claim that telecommunication helps to solve many problems that physical separation would cause to businesses .
The professor points out that holding virtual meetings between teams in different time frames will be challenging .
Thus , one of the team will have to stay late in order to talk to another group causing inconvenience .
It is not easy to prove that there is a relationship between organizational culture and performance .
For a very long time there has not been scientific evidence that proved the relationship between organizational culture and performance , until studies found a correlation between these subjects .
These four studies are put together in a model named ' Organization Culture Performance Model ' ( OCPM ) .
This model tells us that the culture is determined by actual behavior of individual or groups of employees .
The culture is caused by organizational variables .
These variables include internal and external cultural expects .
The external aspect is : external client orientation .
The internal aspects are : design of organization , communication , HRM - orientation and leadership .
This variables influence the behavior of employees .
The model distinguishes three kinds of expected performances : individual- , groups- , and organizational performances .
There is n't a direct relationship between organizational culture and actual performances , but there is a direct relationship between organizational culture and expected performances .
The researchers found that there is a big difference between what the boardroom preach and what the employee 's experience .
A short summary of the OCPM- model : there are organizational variables that determine the visible and invisible behavior of employees .
These variables and behavior of employees determine the expected performance and then there is the actual outcome .
Should smoking be banned ?
More and more people nowadays try to find some ways of relaxation , due to a fast pace of life and stress .
Smoking appeals to hearts of many people of different generations , because it gives a fast relief for a short period of time , that is also quite reasonable .
It 's a fact that tobacco is used as a light drug for centuries by people of different nationalities .
It 's a real issue for the government to understand that if the process of banning smokers starts , the income rate will immediately decrease .
Moreover tobacco contains a vitamin , called PP1 that is beneficial for your health .
It also helps to overcome some stressful situations , even though it 's temporarily , it 's still beneficial for your heart , rather than being constantly stressed .
Finally smoking is personal choice of freedom for everyone .
On the other hand , smokers sometimes even do n't realize that their children or relatives become passive smokers too .
It 's important to understand that you are responsible for your surroundings and people around you .
So if your habits can be harmful for them you need to understand what 's a cost of it .
For the same reason government needs to control the situation , by using banning strategy if people smoke in one of forbidden ares , like kindergartens , schools , hospitals , etc .
In my opinion , people need to have freedom to make decisions on their own , but as soon as it starts to be a treat for others , they should be stopped immediately .
The purpose of this report is to consider how my town takes care of the environment and to explain what kind of recommendations and improvements you can make if you live in Madrid .
Madrid is a huge city which offers a lot of recycling facilities that take care of the environment :
There is a great public transport syste .
It 's very easy to recycle things and it 's possible to choose alternative energy sources .
Firstly , people can take the bus or the underground and leave his or her car at home .
Secondly , it 's quite easy to deposit plastic , paper and glass in different recycling bins .
Another option is the possibility of having solar panels on the roofs of some buildings in Madrid .
We could reuse and recycle household waste .
When we go shopping , we should take our own bags instead of using plastic bags from the shop .
Old clothes , books and toys in good conditions can be passed on to charity shops .
Our aim should be to deposit as many things as possible in the plastic , paper and glass bins .
And if you have a garden , you could turn your vegetable peelings into compost .
In conclusion , Madrid offers a lot of alternatives to take care of the environment .
It could be an example for other cities on how to help and conserve our planet .
Discuss the risks and impacts of climate(weather)-related natural disasters .
Over the past few decades , human activities have changed global climate , hence we are facing higher risks of weather - related disasters .
Furthermore , various destructive disasters have struck into the whole society with many negative elements , drawing the attention of citizens toward catastrophes .
Natural disasters such as drought can be generally defined as one that has a far - reaching influence because its long duration and wide scope .
This essay will examine global warming and precipitation shortage as causes of drought , followed by two main negative impacts in terms of the economic and social problems in agriculture .
One of the overt reasons for weather - related natural disasters is global warming .
It is obvious that global warming can be attributed to greenhouse gas emissions .
Moreover , the world 's uncontrollable population results in the demand of cars , industries and farming industries , that have contributed to greenhouse gases .
With the cause of human activities , the temperature of sea surface and the atmosphere have been gradually growing to a new level .
van Aalst ( 2006 ) pointed out that an increase of earth mean surface temperature with approximately 0.6 degrees has been explored over the past century , with the phenomenon which has been observed that land temperature has exceeded that of seas by a quicker speed ( p.6 ) .
In addition , most of greenhouse gas emissions can affect the atmosphere for decades , which might cause marine monsoon inaccessibility to mainland resulting in low rainfall .
Another phenomenon can be caused by global warming is the decrease of snow coverage in relation to glaciers melting ( van Aalst , 2006 , p. 7 ) .
Thus , it can be seen that global warming has accounted for a series of extreme weather phenomenon .
Undoubtedly , all the factors are responsible for the soil water shortage and decreasing precipitation .
Generally , the increase of temperature has resulted in a surge of hot days , and a drop of cold days .
This will largely causes less of soil water and precipitation .
Additionally , this event is different depending on the areas .
The area as mid - continental will unquestionably become dryer and insufficient precipitation , which is possible to make it more vulnerable to summer droughts ( van Aalst , 2006 , p.8 ) . "
It is estimated that 75 million to 250 million people in Africa will be exposed to water stress due to desertification induced by climate change " , states by IPCC ( as cited in Baker , 2012 , p. 20 ) .
In brief , there will be serious consequences in terms of less precipitation due to extreme weather .
In the economic aspect , drought has brought a tremendous problem of yield for agriculture .
As a consequence of both direct and indirect impacts of agriculture , prolonged drought can be commonly defined as the biggest factor .
The direct impact of prolonged drought is the reduction of incomes for farmers result from the decrease of output .
This can lead to the loss of profits from upstream and downstream throughout the supply chain , which can produce directly negative impacts for producers , as reported by Bauman , Goemans , Pritchett and McFadden ( 2013 , p. 62 ) .
Moreover , it creates a colossal economic damage when the drought occurs : lives are lost , people and animals are forced to move to a new place , resources become unsustainable or even extinct ( Bergholt , 2012 , p. 148 ) .
Another stricken area is social perspective , which has threatened the majority of the population .
Firstly , drought has caused farming in some of the area , such as Africa where is an underdeveloped of infrastructure and a lack of abilities to react after emergency .
Moreover , farming is one of the most crucial impacts of weather - related natural disasters , and it has caused an important number of casualties for both mankind as well as animals .
Secondly , farming also has contributed to migration .
When public suffers from natural disasters and they are no solutions , they are forced to leave their home in order to move to a new place , which could affect the next generation that might confront a multicultural society .
Consequently , drought has led to severe social impacts of natural disasters .
In conclusion , catastrophes such as drought have produced immense economic and social impacts .
Not only human beings but also all the organisms are confronting the threat from climate - related natural disasters .
The fact is natural disasters have changed people and animal 's living environment bringing about a multitude of influences in both direct economic revenue of farmers and indirect effects on enterprise .
Additionally , climate change relates to natural disasters also causes farming which has triggered death and forced people as well as animals leave their home . More seriously , climate is continuingly changing and still contributing to natural disasters .
Thus , we should consider this kind of threat to our future .
Perhaps I am being a little wishful thinking .
I do not blame anyone for this , because I know , this heart of mine seems to just fall in love a little too fast and easily .
It is too early is n't ?
It 's to early to talk about love at this day and age .
Everything seems to strange when you fifteen and you are talking about love .
Why is that so ?
Well , that question has been ringing in my mind for so many months .
This past few months have made my life unfathomable , making me unable to grasp the idea of when is the right age to fall in love .
To me , falling in love , is to accept and admire those little things that exist in that human being .
After I have accepted that , I will begin to push all their flaws aside , because their flaws will only make me fall in love with them even more .
I know it is wrong to have strong feelings for someone who is definitely older , and I know nothing will come out of it .
So why bother loving someone who will never return that love back ?
To me , love is not about having two parties loving and embracing each other .
Their life will be happier when you ceased to exist .
Yes , it hurts , but at the end of the day , almost everything in this world , will make you bleed .
It will make you cringe , bawl like baby .
It will make you feel vulnerable but that is life .
They will always love you base on your looks then personality .
No matter how wrong I may sound , believe me , it is so true .
Love is not all happy .
Love can kill you .
It can kill your soul .

My favourite sport
My favourite sport is walking .
Some people do not think of walking as a sport , they believe that a sport has to be a rough activity one that left you overtired and sweeting .
But in my opinion a sport is any activity that requires a certain amount of physical activity , one that can help you to improve your health .
I enjoy walking because it allows you to do physical exercise and talk , watch the landscape or do other things at the same time .
Walking is also a sport that almost everybody can do .
If you are young you could walk fast , if you are old or not especially fit , you could start walking at a slow pace and with time improve your performance
I would like to give some advice to the people who want to start walking : Take your time , do not want to walk ten kilometers the first day , try first short walks and every day increase the distance .
You will find yourself walking a little longer and faster than the day before .
And if you do that then , sooner than later , you will become a walking enthusiast
It was a sunny day of April .
Easter was coming .
Everyone in the house was so excited about it but not Michael .
He knew that soon he will must face his most powerful enemy , the Easter Bunny .
He did n't know why everybody was in love with him .
This character has been his childhood nightmare .
He used to dream him coming in his bedroom , laughing out loud showing off his sharp teeth , threating him with the most horrible punishments .
He remembered one of the awful dreams he used to have as a child .
He was home alone baby - sitting his two year old sister .
All of a sudden he heard somebody knocking at the front door .
Then a voice roared " I 'm gon na eat you up ! " , " I 'm gon na eat your baby sister up ! " .
" Let me in ! I 'm the Easter Bunny " .
Michael was terrified .
He grabbed the phone trying to call his parents .
But the phone was dead .
He wanted to hide somewhere but he could n't think straight .
In a flash his brain sent him a signal and he realized it was only a dream .
So he started repeating in his mind " It 's only a dream .
It 's only a dream .
You 're going to wake up soon . "
Suddenly he felt brave and unstoppable .
He decided it 's time to face his enemy .
He put his hand on the handle and without thinking too much he opened the door .
This giant scary bunny was just in front of him .
He did n't have time to get scared because all what he was thinking was why he does n't wake up at once .
It ca n't be real .
But the bunny yelled at him to shut the door and bit his arm so badly that tears came out instantly from his eyes .
He was now puzzled and frighten too .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
It is sometimes maintained that when manufacturers and retail companies try to persuade us to buy something , colour is a very effective thing which helps them do that .
I think it is true that colour do influence our decision when we buy different things .
Firstly , I am convinced that colour is very important when people buy clothes , especially for women .
No doubt that manufacturers know which colour is popular and fashionable in a particular season and correspondingly it means that things of this colour will be sold well .
In addition , companies are used to conducting different surveys to find out which colour is more popular in various social classes .
For instance , I have recently read that people who belong to middle class prefer pink and green colours due to some psychological reasons .
Furthermore , colours which are used in decoration of shops or restaurants are also rather influential .
For example , psychologists are convinced that red is a colour which stimulates people 's appetite and makes them feel hungry .
That is why the predominant colour in McDonald 's is red likewise in some other cafes and restaurants .
Having said this , however , I think that there are many other factors which are even more important than colour for people when they buy something .
For example , if I liked a thing , I would not think much about its colour or a colour of the shop where I found it .
Moreover , for many people the main factor is a price of a thing but not its colour .
To some up briefly , I would like to say that there is a special branch of psychology which investigates consumers ' tastes and factors which influence their choice .
Thus , we can conclude that colour is a powerful tool but in the same way manufacturers and retail companies should take into consideration other factors .
Article : My Best Friend
My friendship with Jessie started the first exciting day of kindergarten .
We were three years old .
I went downstairs to the playground for the break .
I was walking alone around the noisy and crowded playground , looking for my very first friend , when I saw a quiet girl under a tree .
She had deep blue eyes and looked very shy .
I instantly wanted to be her friend .
We first met at the swings , she smiled and I knew we were going to be friends forever .
I asked her if she wanted a sweet and timidly , she nodded .
When the break was over we went hand in hand to our classroom .
Gradually , we got to know each other and soon we became best friends .
We played every day together and , in the afternoons , we went to each other 's houses .
Now , we do n't have any secrets between us and we always know when we need each other .
I love how Jessie helps me with everything I need , like with guys or family problems .
We love doing sleepovers , watch movies and going on holidays together .
After many years , we still share the same kind of sweets we shared the first day we met .
It is generally accepted that television is providing us by far the best and easiest way to stay in touch with the whole world , while relaxing on our sofa , taking some time off from our housework .
This is the innovation that such a worldwide media is bringing to our society .
Anyway , I wonder whether it would be useful and able to increase our culture and help us to be more critic towards life rather than impose its power on us .
A recent research shows us why there is always an increasing number of children who are getting used to spend most of their afternoons in front of the television , not to miss a new cartoon nor a well - known film : they seem like they are unaware of the existence of documentaries , news and all the other educative programmes which today televisions are plenty of .
It has been suggested by some European governments to introduce televisions in schools to give the opportunity to discuss together about present topics and problems , in order to learn something more about the world we are living in .
I am sure that , if taken up , this idea will surely be a failure .
In view of the above arguments , I would suggest anyone to cut out on television in order to have more time to read newspapers daily .
In my opinion there is future for public transport .
Firstly public transport is useful for people that can not afford a car and their work is far away from where they live .
Public transport is also useful for some children that need to go to school but they do n't live close to one .
The only choice for many people is to use public transport .
Secondly public transport is better for the environment than using cars because a bus has more space than a car and many people can go on a bus thus decreasing the amount of pollution and helping the enviromnent .
Lastly if the use of public transport decreases drastically or stops many people will be unemployed , they could not win more money and buy cars for going from one place to another .
The countries will have Crisis and this will probably lead to another World War .
That will be a complete disaster because now we have nuclear weapons and we would destroy the world .
In conclusion public transport is very important for every person in some way and without it everything will be a disaster
Taking a year off after finishing school can be harmful depending on what you 're planning to do in that year .
Interrupting the momentum by taking a year off is maybe the worst thing you can do .
Unless you get a job in that year , to keep you busy , or do whatever that keeps you focused and gives you a routine , you should n't take a year off at all .
Without the routine that studying gives you , with all the dealines , the exams , and other stuff that forces you to get things done , and , by consequence , teaches you to be a responsible person , which you would need to be when you get a job , you will simple be wasting one year of your life by taking a break .
One thing that I 've learned in my life is that you never should take a break from your everyday routine unless you really need , due to fatigue or some other physical or pscychological reason , otherwise you will be , I repeat , just wasting time , time that you could be spending in an usefull way , by getting something done , or improving yourself academically , intelectualy or doing whatever you think that can enrich your life .
So , whether you take a year off or not , my point is that you should n't be wasting your time .
Do n't waste your time , spend it in a fruitful way .
I 've wasted so much time in my life that even I found it embarrassing .
I 've wasted the best years of my life doing nothing .
Now I 'm doing something , although I will probably never see the fruits of my labor .
I like to beleieve that , like the old Latin proverb says ( and I have already said this ) , there will be glory at the end to the man who endures hardships in his path .
Maybe one day I will experience the glory that awaits at high places those who walk through the narrow paths of life .
Or , most probably , I wo n't .
Regardless of what 's waiting for me at the end , I will never give up walking through those hard paths no matter how challenging and hard they may be .
This is some intimate stuff I 'm sharing with you my teacher .
I hope you do n't think that sharing these thoughts with you makes you my new best buddie .
Your only job here is to teach me the subject you 're supposed to teach .
I do n't need your friendship you bastard !
I hope I do n't get an F by saying this , but it is the truth , and I love being honest . I know , as soon you put your creepy , wicked eyes on my composition I must expect a bad grade .
Maybe I will bribe you at the end of school term to get a good grade .
What do you think of that , you prick ?
I bet you love money , especially money obtained by illegal means , do n't you ?
Poor teacher , I can only wonder how a teacher would react to see such a thing written by a student .

I was alive ! I was alive! ... I could n't believe it !
Having gone through all those tough times ; trials and tribulations and I was alive !
I was as happy as a lark but soon it was getting dark .
My leg was injured and it was as painful as a thorn in the paw ; after countless hours of crawling .
I could n't bear the pain but I had to endure it to survive my ordeal .
Leaning forward slowly , I started crawling slowly like a turtle along the slender hill ; I was on all four !
I was feeling as tired as a worn out shoe .
After a long and tiring crawl , I needed to find a shelter from where I could seek refuge from the chilling wind howling over my head unabated .
I kept my body very close to the icy ground in order to reduce the impact of the bone - chiseling wind .
Suddenly I saw a small gap between two blocks of snowy hills just enough for me to lie down in .
The place was a bit gloomy and cold but I had no choice ; I was too tired to move on .
But before I knew it I was asleep .
I woke up to the sound of the howling wind once again , in a state of vertigo .
Looking down at the watch on my wrist , I realized it had been nearly a week since I survived the fall over the snowy cliff and now I had to go through this all alone with no improvement to my dire predicament .
I continued crawling on all four while wondering , for how much longer , Simon till we meet again .
I never stopped praying all along ; in hope that somehow , somewhere , someone would come along to rescue me .
As I was climbing downhill , I found myself getting blisters on my palm in a manner I could have no control over .
The pain was excruciating but I just had to move on as if I ever hoped to survive my ordeal !
As quickly as I could , I managed to get myself to the nearest leafless tree that I could find where I leaned my back against it to try to gain whatever support I could muster with the little energy that I had left in my body .
I was a broken man ; barely alive !
Emphatically I reminded myself that I should n't have survived had it not been for God 's help !
I kept praying to God to give me the inner strength to carry on although I was fully aware of my own self - imposed exile from church services the last two years .
Doubts began to creep in , " Would God show his mercy ? " .
With the pain , doubts , hunger all crashing down on me , I was about to give up my fight for ultimate survival .
A second thought crossed my mind telling me that I would miss my family and my best friends !
I had to carry on to fight to stay alive !
The very thought of winning an accolade in front of a jubilant crowd disappeared all together and all I ever wanted was to be home , be safe , and be with my family .
Hello Sir / Miss .
My name is Alexandra kennedy .
I 'm 29 , I have a 9 year old daughter .
I was born in Russia , but lived in many different countries around the world .
I have got a family of my own , so I am familiar with looking after children and taking care of them . I enjoy fitness - and can easily help organise children sport activities .
I do enjoy communicating with children , I like to play games and learn something new from them !
In the evenings we would arrange different activities , like plays , singing , dancing .
I am also quiet experienced in the kitchen . I am really into healthy nutrition and healthy cooking .
It is important for children to get healthy meals , especially at the age of early teenage years .
I wo n't be afraid of any sort of jobs , I am ready for an adventure !
Well , the person that I most admire in today 's world is my mother .
Because she gave me life , without her I would not be what I am today .
She is a great woman hardworking , responsible , kind , friendly , intelligent and an amazing person .
She was my firs teacher who was taught me repeat the first word and took my hand to give my first step .
She taught me step by step how to prepare for life .
I have fond memories from my childhood , she was always cheering me up when I was in my sad or difficult times , even when she was not feeing well .
She 's like my best friend ; always advising me on what is good or bad .
She is very brave , it does n't matter how difficult the problem is , the most important thing is to carry on .
In fact , my mother is my idol , my angel .
There is no doubt that the subject of keeping animals in zoos creates a lot of debate .
Some people say zoos are traditional family entertainment and good for animals .
Others say keeping animals in zoos is cruel and inhumane .
One advantage of zoos is that they give people the chance to see and learn about animals .
This makes people more likely to want to look after animals and protect their natural habitats .
Due to the interest in protecting animals , people are eager to take part in organizations such as World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) which is an international non - governmental organization working on issues regarding the conservation , research and restoration of the environment .
Another positive aspect of zoos is that they help to protect endangered species by offering them a safe place to live .
In addition , zoos help to find mates for endangered species .
For example , many pandas would not find a mate to breed with if they were on their own in the wild .
On the other hand , there are many arguments against keeping animals in zoos .
Firstly , zoo animals often suffer from stress and boredom when they are not in their natural habitat .
Secondly , unwanted animals are sometimes sold to circuses , hunting parks or for meat .
Consequently , they are mistreated , hit and live in an inadequate place where they can not behave freely .
Another drawback is that animals sometimes escape from their enclosures , which is dangerous for humans .
This is clearly seen when driving in the route and suddenly you see a bull or a cow in the middle of the way .
this may cause not only the animal death by being run over but also the passengers ' death if the driver tries to stop and lose the control of the car .
To conclude , there are strong arguments for and against keeping animals in zoos .
Personally , I think it is acceptable to keep animals in zoos , as long as they have enough space and are properly looked after .
First of all , I would like to say that the young people have worse health nowadays .
This is not their fault , of course .
It is our fault because we have let the companies to profit from our own sins .
We are made of flesh and it can be very difficult to resist the temptation .
You should take a look at the things your children have at their reach .
They have computers , smartphones , cleaning robots , fast food ...
And the list goes on .
I am not saying we should travel back in time .
We have developed technology to make our lives easier .
Nevertheless , we can not allow that technology to put our children in danger .
On the one hand , I am going to sound like my grandfather telling his war tales .
On the other hand , can someone tell me why their children can spend hours playing video games ?
Why do we allow them to eat hot dogs ?
Why do they need a smartphone ?
In summary , I know it is a hard choice . I am talking about multinational companies that try to change our way of life to suit their needs .
I am a believer that any parent would do whatever it takes to protect their children .
Therefore , I call to action .
Kateryna was born in 1988 in Siberia , RF in the family of Ukrainian Tatars .
Kateryna was sent to Ukraine at the age of 6 .
The art of writing letters along with painting colorful mandalas were taught by her grandmother .
A huge mirror in her bedroom made a child believe that one is able to travel through it anywhere .
Algebra and geometry were the most important subjects taught by her grandfather .
She loved watching printer at work producing numerous results of psychology tests , which she had just passed .
She graduated the high - school at the age of 15 .
By this time she had been spending almost all her free time near the computer .
She devoted all her free time to experiments on linking the math homework with programming of the music equalizer .
That 's how creating visuals on the screen became her favorite activity .
She graduated Kiev International University in 2009 .
Kateryna was frustrated with classic film genre and started looking for possibilities for realization of experimental theoretical ideas on practice .
After taking part in numerous festivals and concerts she had finally entered a joint British - Russian program for training socio - cultural managers in the cultural sphere .
The sport that I like the most is Dancing .
It may sound weird or even wrong for some people , because there are many of them that do n't even consider dancing as a sport ... but for me , and for everyone that has ever done dancing , it is not only a sport , but a very difficult one .
Dancing requires a lot of things , like cordination , flexibility , and physical condition , just to mention a few .
But despite how hard dancing can be , it is also really fun , and that 's actually what makes me enjoy it the most .
You do n't even notice how hard your body is working because you really are enjoying yourself , and I think that 's awesome because it just makes everything easier .
However , I would advise people who would like to start dancing to really take it serious , because even though I said it is fun , it really does require commitment and discipline .
Dancing is not as easy as everybody thinks , but it is definitely worth a try .
The influence of the grown - ups : great or not so ?
Recently I have listened to a discussion on how adults can be a good influence on young people .
This got me thinking , how do adults influence the behaviour of youngsters ?
And is this always a good influence , or should adults interfere less with the behaviour of younger people ?
Adults can influence the behaviour of youngsters in different ways .
First of all , they can give rules to younger people .
This can differ from the rules your parents have set for you , to the laws created by the governmen .
These rules can influence behaviour in a positive way , because they prevent you from doing stupid things .
Secondly , adults can offer advice to the youngsters .
This might be of great influence on youngster , for adults are seen as the wiser people .
They have more life experience so they probably know what they are talking about .
Lastly , adults can set an example for younger people .
Think of celebrities for example .
They are of great influence on younger people .
When someone greatly admires a person , they will try to behave like them .
So when admirable adults set good examples for youngsters , they can influence behaviour in a positive way .
However , it is n't all that great .
Because young people often do n't like to be belittled .
So setting rules might cause them to do the exact opposite .
Especially when they have to live under a great lot of rules .
Also , advice is n't always taken positively .
This is because adults lived in a complete other time , so their advice might be outdated .
This causes young people to ignore the advice .
Lastly , when a wrong example is set , this can influence behaviour in a negative way , because they 'll try to act to this wrong example .
So all in all , there are many ways in which adults can influence the behaviour of younger people .
And whether this is taken positively , is completely up to the adults and youngsters themselves .
Myths and facts about frozen shoulder
Frozen shoulder or shoulder stiffness is an extremely limiting and debilitating disease .
The condition starts with pain when you move your shoulder joint and then progresses into total failure and limitation of the shoulder .
Although very important and critical , there are lots of myths surrounding it and many patients suffering the disease do not know the real facts about it .
Today we will make a spotlight on the famous facts and myths about " Frozen shoulder " .
1- Most of the patients believe they have got frozen shoulder due to a trauma or injury in the shoulder joint , but this is a myth because frozen shoulder can occur after a trauma or even without any trauma as in elderly people especially those who have diabetes and those recovering from an operation .
2- If you believe that doing exercises worsens your condition , then that is another myth because frozen shoulder occurs to people who stop or decrease using their shoulder joint for a long time .
Usually after major operations , having a stroke or bone fracture .
They ignore using full range of joint motion to avoid the pain sensation .
So an inflammatory response starts leading to the joint stiffness , movement becomes painful and range of movement is limited by time .
3- An important fact about frozen shoulder is that no surgeries are usually needed .
The first treatment that your doctor will suggest is medications such as analgesics and paracetamol .
In addition to this , physical therapy is also an important way of treatment to maintain a full range of movement .
Cortisone injections are also helpful , these injections can improve everything ; decrease swelling , stiffness and pain .
Surgery is our last resort if the condition is severe and all the previous lines of treatment failed .
4- If you believe that you can easily prevent frozen shoulder , then of course you are right .
You can never have a frozen shoulder if you followed these advices :
- If you had a surgery or an injury , you should keep moving your shoulder joint within a limit even if it is painful .
- Having physical therapy after a surgery or trauma is crucial .
Physical therapy returns your body to its previous healthy condition before trauma .
If not done , healing is not fully completed and the joint remains painful .
Therefore , further avoidance of movement occurs and leads to frozen shoulder .
- Physiotherapy is not only about exercises , some physiotherapy techniques can decrease your pain and suffering .
Introduction
The aim of this report is to inform an international organisation how our town takes care of the environment as well as what do people do with their rubbish and how the town is trying to keep the area clean and attractive .
What people do with their rubbish
Nowadays young children are well informed about the dynamics and the complexity about the pollution cycle .
However , it is estimated that at least 70% of young kids do not take care of their personal rubbish and are the main contributors to a polluted environment .
Besides the fact that adults were not as well taught as children in school , they are the most civilized and responsible .
A study shows that adults take care of their personal garbage not just because of their education but because of their anxiety to show their kids that they are a great and responsible parents .
How the town tries to keep the area clean
According to our mayor , there are several points that our town really cares about to always keep our area as clean as possible .
Every year we nominate a person that is responsible for supervising the dustman 's work every single day .
As far as I am concerned there are now a few rules in our town legislation that if you do not take care of your garbage or if you take papers to the floor you will have to pay a fine .
This fine can reach between 100 and 150 euros .
Conclusion
To conclude this report , there are many things that still need to be done .
However , everything starts at the level of education that every human being receives .
Unfortunately , there is still a long way to do in terms environment concerns , but some of this solutions suggested by the mayor help us stopping the pollution .
Environmental problems are becoming more and more serious all over the world .
There are some kinds of pollution such as garbage and wasted bottles , but some pollution is invisible such as noise and dirty air .
Air pollution is the most serious problem among all other kinds of pollution nowadays .
They have already had great impact on people 's life .
" Air " is one of the necessities to maintain a human being 's life .
However air pollution affects not only people health but also the whole environmental system .
China is a big industrial country so there are a great number of factories and trucks .
Much dirty air is released every day .
Trucks have made the air unhealthy for people to breathe and poisonous gas is given off by a lot of factories .
It also makes oxygen lacking but more and more carbon dioxide , the same result as CO2 .
CO2 can destroy the ozone .
If we do n't start to face this problem , we will hurt this planet we live in .
Environmental problems that touch us all .
Not only the government should make laws to control the situation but also we should do our best not to create more pollution .
For Example , if you do n't smoke , you wo n't cause air pollution and you wo n't damage your health ; if you use public transportation , walk more or take bicycle as your transportation , you will not only help reduce the pollution bust also improve your health .
Also , planting more trees instead of cutting them to purify our breathing air and reduce air pollution .
While there are many things to appreciate and celebrate about the world in which we live many pressing environmental problems cry out for our attention .
To maintain the only earth we live in is now the major issue for us nowadays .
It 's also our responsibility to protect it and to do our best to prevent it from being polluted .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
Was 31st October .
She went out to meet her friend from India .
They had been writing for two years on the internet .
It was dark outside , the weather was windy and the leaves fell from the trees .
Alison ran along the nocturnal streets of France .
They were to meet on the street Boulevard Arago .
When Alison came to she did not see any people .
She waited for half an hour but her friend never came .
When it was already 10 pm suddenly a car appeared in the dark .
Alison felt fear , her heart was beating and she started to run .
The car began to chase her .
She ran forward but was far from home .
Tears flowed down her cheeks , she could not run any longer .
Finally , she saw the lights of the approaching car and ran toward the car .
The car stopped quickly and her friend stepped out of the car .
They embraced and Alison thanked him for saving her .
The Usual Suspects , one of the best movies in the last two decades .
I must confess I feel like I am cheating .
They have asked me to choose a thriller and it has been so easy it feels bad .
I am going to start with the actors of this movie .
Most of them were not stars when they made it .
They became stars because of this film .
Therefore , it would be incredible expensive to reunite all of them again for another film .
They are credible , especially Kevin Spacey , Charles Palminteri and Gabriel Byrne .
The Usual Suspects is the first movie by Bryan Singer .
I think it is the best one too .
At that moment he seemed like the new Steven Spielberg .
Nowadays he has turned into another director .
The photography is also good .
The soundtrack is not spectacular .
It has a pair of good tunes and they use them .
The script separates this film from the others .
The script is made of pure gold .
It is so tightly knitted you do not realise it is telling you the story of a failure .
There is a scene , at the very end , where you can see a transformation .
You become aware of what was going on and you start to travel back into the film story .
That moment is priceless .
I think that the best way to recommend this movie to anyone one is to quote from The Usual Suspects : " the best trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he did n't exist . "

There is no future for public transportation , is in my opinion a wrong assumption .
The modern times have raised the concern about the environment , climate change and energy .
The public transportation can help fighting greenhouse gas emissions and can help us protect the world from Climate change effects .
In the recent years there has been a great change in consumption habits .
Now days , people can choose the most convenient way of travelling and there is no doubt that using a private car is easy , cheap and fun .
On the other hand , using a private car is totally ignoring the environmental damage and effects .
In developing countries , there is still a low level of awareness about the side effects of using private polluting cars .
But in modern countries , the environmental effects of one 's behavior is becoming important and concerning .
In my opinion it is just a matter of time until all the transportation options will be public and the private cars will be left behind .
People 's life will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
We can know this just by comparing the life now and 50 years ago .
If we do so , we can see the massive difference in our lives from the people living 50 years back .
Although now we have very advanced technology which has made our lives completely different and comfortable than before , in the future it will be much better than this .
We will see things happening then which today seem to be impossible .
The other difference , hopefully , will be in medicine .
We will definitely have better drugs and also less incurable diseases .
However , it is possible that along new inventions and research there might be more harmful viruses also .
All these differences will make people 's lives tranquil .
There are some downsides of an advanced world too , for example , people will be more unhealthy due to the environmental conditions and also less self - reliant because of the technology progress .
Should boys and girls go to the same school ?
Many parents face a dilemma when choosing the type of education they wish to give to their children and one of the first decisions they must take is what type of school they would like their children to attend and whether it should be a single sex school or a mixed sex one .
It can not escape our minds that at this stage and age , children are exposed to sexual images from a very early age and some people would argue that our society is hyper sexualised , which is a reason why many parents see single sex schools as a means to protect their offspring from having sexual thoughts before they are ready to understand the complexity of sex and sexual relationships .
While the hyper sexualisation of our society may be a reality that many parents would want to protect their children from , it is true to say that children need to adapt and be ready for the society in which they live and for may parents , sending their children to a mixed sex school is just a natural environment , much more similar to the " outside world " in which they would grow to adulthood .
Considering how much time children spend at school , it appears to me that choosing a single sex school will make the child , somehow , segregated and in many cases , reinforce some of the may stereotypes that we , as society , have regarding gender which , if we take into consideration that these children are going to be the future leaders , educators , lawyers , politicians and so on , I would argue that the more schools reflect our society and the way that we like it to be , the better , not only for the child as a person , but the child as a key in the future of the country and , as an extent , to the world .
Therefore and to sum up , Is my view , that public money is better spent supporting mix sex schools , which reflects the society we live in , as opposed to single sex ' which may reinforce those stereotypes that are mining society .
I absolutely agree with this statement . Travelling by car is not only much more convenient than public transport , it also grants one 's independence to go wherever and whenever one might wish .
Moreover , driving grants motorists one of the most popular feelings in Western societies : the feeling of being free .
Even if it is true that many citizens use public transport when their finances are tight , it is also true that most of those same people would use their private cars instead if given the chance .
The car industry could also be considered one of the main driving engines of the Western economy .
It is difficult to imagine what the future would hold for the European economies if the car industry collapsed .
Thousands would lose their jobs , both directly in the car factories and indirectly in many other car - related businesses , like car part stores , petrol stations , garages , and so on .
If private transport was fully replaced by public transport , the world 's economic foundations would shake and a global financial crisis of unprecedented impact could occur .
It is true that cars pollute the atmosphere , but it is also true that the emissions from public transport also contribute to pollution - some would say that even more than private transport , as Diesel motors are particularly dirtier and more inefficient than smaller , petrol driven motors like those of private cars .
All things considered we might conclude that public transport will eventually disappear in the short term and in no time everyone will be driving their own clean - energy - driven flying cars to go everywhere .

Recently , genetic engineering has become a highly controversial issue around the world .
Many people think that genetic engineering has many drawbacks .
However , others claim that it is vital for societies and next generations .
Genetic engineering is the process of manipulating the genes of an organism .
According to supporters of it , there are many benefits of genetic engineering .
As it is known , it is used to produce crops that are more resistant to insects and diseases .
Besides , some genetically modified crops grow more quickly .
Supporters also claim that , it is vital for some countries which are struggling with famine .
The other benefit is about human life .
With genetic engineering , human health has become better in many ways .
For instance , it may be used by scientists to cure some diseases .
Genes could be changed before a baby is born thus , inherited illnesses would no longer exist .
It could also be possible to clone human organs so that we could have a chance to replace our damaged body parts .
In spite of the benefits , there are also certain drawbacks of human genetic engineering .
There are many ethical concerns about human genetic engineering .
It is still unacceptable in most cultures because of their religious beliefs .
They believe that it is unnatural .
Another problem is the genetically modified food products .
Although they look bigger or more attractive , genetically modified food products are unhealthy for people .
In conclusion , it seems the benefits outweigh the drawbacks of human genetic engineering .
Therefore , genetic engineering is important for humanity and the future .
Charles Dickens and the Brönte sisters were famous Victorian writers .
Not only did they share a clear interest in writing about social issues that struck the contemporary life in Britain , but they also had similar ways of structuring their novels .
For example , in Dickens ' " David Copperfield " and Charlotte Brönte 's " Jane Eyre " , the story is told by their respective protagonists who remember their own past experiences .
In both novels the writers also dealt with the mistreatment of children in workhouses ( " David Copperfield " ) and Boarding Schools ( " Jane Eyre " ) .
Although they may share these themes , their ways of writing are quite different .
In the Brönte sisters ' works , we can find some Gothic elements - especially in Emily 's only novel " Wuthering Heights"- and a detachment from the figure of the Victorian dutiful woman .
In Dickens ' novels Realism allows the readers to know how tough London society was in that period .
Michael , my never - ending love story , was walking down the street one night with no particular thoughts in his mind .
It was a narrow street lined up by two - story buildings on the floor of which shops , pubs were flashing their neon signs .
People were coming in or out of the pubs , some walking straight , others on all fours , cheerful anyway .
Michael could n't bring himself to enter one , too proud to admit he needed people 's company after a long year of being a single guy because he , on the spur of the moment , decided to split up with me .
How could this have happened to him ?
What he did n't know , or just could n't accept , was he was unwilling to tolerate other people 's views , and jokes that 's why he packed my things and asked me to find another place to stay .
The reason ? I told him I found a job in another city and I was considering moving house .
I explained to him it was the chance of my life given that good jobs for women are difficult to find , pay is n't the same as for men and I felt I did n't receive the status men in my company enjoyed .
He just could n't take it .
I mean it was a joke I made and I had no real intention to leave him .
No one could have anticipated what happened next .
I must have seem cruel to him because , despite our daily disagreements , he adored me and was serious about settling down soon .
But I guess it was too big a shock , so Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Dear Paul ,
Thank you for your e - mail .
It is very nice to hear from you .
As you know , I helped at a concert of U2 last month and I 'd like to tell you something more about it .
It was , of course , a ones in a lifetime opportunity , one I grabbed with both hands .
When you hear you are asked to help out in a concert of your favourite band , you ca n't refuse .
I was asked to take care of the VIP room .
I was responsible for fulfilling all the needs of these famous guests .
I must say that not all of them are veru easy to work with .
The things some of them wanted , unbelievable!Luckily , I had some other students helping me find all the curious things for the famous .
Despite all the hard work I had to do , I would not have to think twice if they ask me to do it again .
It was , after all , an amazing experience .
Not to say that now I have some good connections in the world of the rich and famous !
All the best ,
Deirdre
Due to the ever - increasing population coupled with the climate change , food shortage has become a significant facing by many countries .
Some assert that genetically modified technology can be applied to address this problem .
This essay will argue that genetically modified food can be the way out of the problem of food deficit and this will be done by focusing on its environmental benefits and increasing food yield .
Firstly , GM food can have a positive impact on the problem of food safety .
It is well known that the GM food is inserted with various resistance genes , such as pest disease resistance gene .
This means that the food being more resistant to pests and agricultural diseases can minimise the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers that can poison the water supply and pollute the environment .
This reduction in the application of chemical materials can create a safer agricultural environment , ensuring food safety .
Furthermore , GM food can also improve the production of crops .
Due to the various new traits resulting from the GM technology , such as drought tolerance and salinity tolerance , GM food can ensure the food production in the period of drought .
This could be important for food production , especially in developing countries .
However , some may argue that it is also questionable whether GM food has a detrimental impact on human health .
Actually , thousands of tests on GM food , before bring it into markets , have been proven that it is harmless to both the environment and human health .
In conclusion , it is evident that GM food can increase food yields with the less use of chemicals .
In views of this , it is reasonable to believe that GM food might be an ideal strategy to alleviate the problem of food shortage .
However , because there are some disadvantages in GM technology which is being developed , it is also recommended that governments should give more importance to the management of GM food .
An elderly university professor had to give his students the last lesson of his professional life , because he was going to retire .
However , only a few students , just five or six , had followed his course and , recently , only two of them had been present .
As soon as the professor entered the classroom , he was surprised to see that it was completely full .
He thought that many students had decided to follow his last lesson and he was pleased and moved by this kindness .
There was very little light in the classroom because it had been a rainy afternoon and a terrible thunderstorm had caused an electrical blackout .
When a student came in , also he was surprised to see so many people inside , but , after a while , he realized what was really happening : dozens of wet raincoats had been left on the chairs by students of another course .
The student did n't have the courage to interrupt his teacher and give him such a strong pain and disillusion : he slunk away while the old professor was still speaking enthusiastically to nobody .
Students Use of Leisure Time
On 3th March 2014 , a survey was conducted among 60 students .
The purpose of the survey was to discover popular leisure time activities of male and female students .
The survey was carried out by means of a questionnaire given to the male and female students to complete .
It consisted of three parts .
The first part of the questionnaire dealt with leisure time activities on holidays .
The second section was concerned with time - out activities .
The third part touched on the ways of spending free time at home .
From the table of data , the most significant items are as follows .
It has been found in the first section that a large percentage of the male respondents preferred to stay at home on holidays , while 90% of the female students would like to go to the seaside .
The male students would gladly go to historical places , while 57% of the girls who filled in the questionnaire were n't inclined to spend their free time in that way .
In the second section both the girls and the boys interrogated claimed that they do n't spend their free time going to the theatre or the opera .
53% of the male students never do that ; while 50% of the girls stated that they try to go theatres and operas several times a year to expand their horizons .
The majority of the male and female respondents enjoy going to nightclubs in their spare time .
For example , only 10% percent of the boys never do that and 24% go to nightspots at least one time a week .
More than a half of the male students spend their spare time doing sport two and more times a week .
Unlike the boys the female respondents usually do n't feel like going in for sport at leisure .
In contrast to the male respondents the girls interrogated go to evening classes in their free time .
While 53% of the boys never do that .
Like the male respondents the girls interrogated go regularly to the cinema .
For instance , 47% of the female respondents watch films on a big screen every week .
In the third part of the questionnaire was found out that the male respondents are similar to the girl respondents in that they both enjoy listening to music at home more than 2 hours a day .
In contrast to the girls interrogated who almost never play computer games the majority of the male students gamble for hours at leisure .
The female respondents are more fond of reading books that the male ones .
40% of the girls read books several hours a day , while 13% of the male students do n't read in their free time at all .
The males who filled in the questionnaire and the females alike spend many hours by surfing the Internet .
For example , 53% of the female students are on - line more than 3 hours a day .
If any conclusions may be drawn from the data , they are as follows .
The leisure activities of the male and female students have a lot in common .
There is an evident tendency to the decline in the active ways of spending free time .
The young people of both sexes prefer to be on - line or playing computer games at leisure .
According to the findings , it is clear that nowadays going to nightclubs and cinemas are more popular than going to theatres and operas or visiting historical places .
There are therefore a clear need for young people to prefer active and educating leisure time activities to passive ones .
Dear Mrs Lusik ,
First of all , we would like to thank you for letting us know about your concerns and giving us the opportunity to explain ourselves .
Please accept our dearest apologies ; it was the least of our intentions to offend you with our release letter , which is a standard format authorized by our legal department .
We already passed your comments about the format on to our chief lawyer and hope he can approve the necessary adjustments .
Be assured that we take your concerns seriously .
We would like to thank you for making us aware of the strong sound of the letter .
Of course you can share your opinions and experiences about your stay wherever and with whoever you wish .
There has never been any intention of hiding the truth as you said .
In addition , we are sorry that your holiday experience was affected by the fire occurred on Saturday October 10th , 2015 .
Our staff worked hard to relocate our guests as soon as possible in nearby hotels and at our Paraíso Complex , in order for them to continue enjoying their holidays .
It was not an easy task to find a new accommodation and relocate over a thousand people .
We do know that the incident might have caused some inconveniences , but the most important thing is that none of our guests or staff was injured .
We are sorry for the time it took to relocate you , the least we could do was to offer you an upgraded room at Paraiso Mar y Beach .
You mentioned in your email that you would have travelled again with IBEROSTAR if it was not for the format of the release letter .
We hope that our explanations and apologies will make you change your mind and that you give us another chance in the future to provide you with a much more delightful experience .
Given the circumstances we would like to offer one of the following compensations if you decide to travel with us again in the future :
Having used public transport for so many years , as I 've lived in a big city since I was just a child , I do n't think public transport will disappear .
In my opinion many people depend on public transport to get to their place of work , university or school .
In terms of money it is much cheaper to travel by bus than to use your own car .
If you compare the price of petrol with the price of a bus ticket you can clearly see how much better it is to travel by bus .
I enjoy travelling by bus or train , on your journey you can read or just look through the windows .
You do n't need to get angry or mad if you do n't find a parking space , you can just get on / off the bus wherever you like .
You can also enjoy the company of those travellers sharing the same transport .
Sometimes you can even meet new people on the bus .
However , I must agree that travelling by car can give you more freedomn , you can carry your shopping and pick up other people on the way .
Furthermore , you can choose what time you would like to travel and where .
But despite all this there will always be people without a car who needs to commute every day so there is a long future for public transport .
As long as people keep accepting this technology for communication , social media sites will also keep proceeding to the next step and affecting the society .
In terms of the communication society , they will possibly change the way in which people develop relationship with each other , and consequently , they will create two types of culture : communal and agentic .
In the former , people have ability almost equally , and value interpersonal relationship .
In contrast , agentic culture stresses the differences between individuals , along with egotism and inequality ( Zarbatany , Conley , & Pepper as cited in Okazaki , & Taylor , 2013 ) .
These types of culture will oppositely exist in the future as an effect of social media sites .
ARTICLE
There is nothing worse than not be able to communicate with people when you 're in a foreign country .
It might be such a frustrating sensation that you could n't want to go back again .
This article deal with the benefits and drawbacks , if there are any , of learning another language .
Speaking for myself , I think that the pros outweigh the cons .
On the one hand you 'll feel more active and you 'll realise how your brain memory gets better and better .
Besides , you 'll understand the native people when you 're going on holiday .
And furthermore , it 'll be reassuring to get by with your basic necessities in another country .
On the other hand , studying a new language can be a bit daunting at first and you 'll have to keep on track on a daily basis if you want to improve your language skills .
This could be a drawback because not all the people are up to the task .
To wrap up the article I 'd strongly recommend that young people to learn at least a new foreign language especially if you 're a student .
This will give you an advantage in your future career .
Nowadays , famous people like movie stars , politicians , models and other celebrities suffer from lack of privacy .
Paparazzi and journalists are following them everywhere they go .
They are also the reason for many problems , which appear in private lives of some celebrities .
It is known , that it is the job of paparazzi to follow famous people and look for sensation in their daily behaviour and celebs are aware of the fact , that they are recognised everywhere , but an interest in one 's private life , when the person does n't want to is basically a synonim for trespassing .
I strongly agree with the statement , that famous people also should have their own private lives , which no one 's following and that no one knows about it .
It is very hard to lead a normal life , when you have to think all day long , about what you say , what you wear and first of all , what you do .
Being a celebrity means working all the time , you have not a single moment to relax and forget about your work .
On the other hand , it is obvious that people want to know everything they can about celebrities they like or admire and journalists give them the opportunity to find out some information about their lives , but they often cross the line and literally deprive these famous people of private life .
In my opinion everyone deserves to have a private life even if he is a public person .
I 'm sure that no one would like to see his photo in a newspaper , on which he 's eating or making a stupid face and that 's why we should respect other 's privacy .
Everything that goes on in the famous person 's life , including births , deaths , illness and divorces is fodder for the tabloids .
If the individual stumbles , whether figuratively or literally , speculation about him will end up on TV , on the Internet or the front page of the tabloids .
On the one hand , many famous people like being discussed all over the world .
They think that due to scandals they will be able to get fame , live in the lap of luxury and have a lot of money .
On the other hand , not everybody prefers to reveal the secrets of the private life .
For these kinds of people it is important not to bring out family scenes and problems , as they do n't want to be disputed in public .
But in spite of this , sometimes journalists can be too insistent , trying to get at as much information as possible .
Generally , celebrities deserve to have a private life .
When you clock out at work , no one has the right to make you keep working .
As it seems to me , private information about stars should be published if they approve of it putting the signature .
It would be fairly by celebrities .
Dear Paul ,
Thanks for your email .
I 'm glad to hear that you 've decided to take part in an organisation of this month 's concert .
I hope you find it useful as I did last month .
I 'm writing to tell you about my experience I gained during preparations for the last concert .
It was really awesome !
As a volunteer I was helping make meals for VIP guests .
You know , I have graduated culinary school and it was a great opportunity to use my skills . I 've made a lot of new friends .
We 're still in touch .
The bad thing about it was that it took me a lot of time .
I fell behind , but it was worth it .
I know it could be a problem for you since you ca n't cook , but organisers need volunteers in many fields : scenography , sounding , VIP - escort .
I 'm sure you 'll find something for you and you 'll enjoy it .
So my recommendation to you would be to do something similar if you are looking for good experiences and plenty of laughs !
Let me know how it goes .
All the best .
Arthur
We are living in a digital age .
Nowadays almost everyone in the world has contact with computers and the great majority of them have been using the Internet .
The Internet has many good points : it 's an infinite source of information and it 's a cheaper and faster way to communicate with other people .
The Internet is also a ' home ' for many social networks .
One of them , the most famous and the most used , is Facebook .
We can use Facebook to get in touch with our friends and even to meet new people .
Sounds nice and easy , right ?
However , Facebook , as well as many other social networking sites , has its dark side too .
On the one hand , it 's addictive . Internet addiction represents a serious problem in our age .
It may lead to inefficiency at school - or workplace - or even sleeping disorders .
On the other hand , lots of people using fake accounts are lurking on Facebook .
This means you do n't know for sure who you 're really talking to .
Nowadays , anyone can take a photo from the web and assume it 's theirs .
Stalkers , pedophiles , human traffickers , murderers and other criminals ; these are just a small part of the threats you can come across on Facebook .
In conclusion , I think that we ca n't be safe anywhere anymore - not even online .
The best way to keep ourselves safe is to keep our Facebook profiles private .
And also , lets not forget that going out with friends from time to time wo n't hurt anyone .
The Soviet Union collapse has become one of the defining events in the world 's history .
It influenced the further development of post - Soviet countries as well geopolitical situation in the whole world .
It has also influenced the international relations not just within post - Soviet area , but also in the entire world , as the period after the collapse of the USSR was marked as crash of bipolar structure of international relations .
So long as for fifty years the world lived under the shadow of the Cold War , fearing a fatal confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union , the dissolution of the USSR had a huge resonance not only in the US mass - media but also in the American society .
American press had widely illustrated the revolution in the Baltic States and the tension which has been spread in the Soviet Union after the fall of the Berlin Wall as well as the fall of communist governments within the whole former Soviet Bloc .
The tensions in the Soviet Union came to its peak in August 1991 , while Gorbachev was on vacation in the Crimea , a group of right wing military and KGB leaders staged a coup in Moscow .
The"New York Times " made a series of publications dedicated to the coup .
They were published under the common title " Soviet crisis " .
The articles headlined " Soviet crisis " have broadly described the situation in the capital of Russia .
On the August 20 , " New York Times " published the article which contained the excerpts from the news conference held by Acting President Gennadiy Yanayev and four other members of the State Committee for the State of Emergency .
The American press summing up the era of Gorbachov frequently highlighted his attempts to increase the openness of the Soviet society .
Those attempts were considered as one of Gorbachov 's main merits . "
The buried secrets of past regimes and the foibles of the present one were exposed to public scrutiny by a press " - the New York Times wrote .
The plotters have immediately encountered strong opposition from the leadership of the RSFSR leaders under the guidance of President Boris Yeltsin .
Tens of thousands hit the streets in Russia in order to defend the democracy .
Decisive actions of Yeltsin have been supported by most world governments and international communities .
Boris Yeltsin has gained international acclaim when he occupied the Russian White House and faced down the threats of the coup 's leaders .
The coup , due to lack of organization and support by the military forces , failed three days after .
The person of Boris Yeltsin has become the most popular one in that time world 's press .
Leading articles of the most read newspapers in the States were dedicated to the first Russian president .
American newspapers wrote that Boris Yeltsin acquired new status for his defiant stand , also mentioning that the people had knew a little about him .
The article of the New York Post " THE SOVIET CRISIS ; Yeltsin 's Remarks : A ' Reactionary Coup " refers to the night of 18 - 19 August 1991 when the legally elected President of the country was removed from power .
The author lays the stress on the democratic processes in the country which have acquired broad and irreversible character .
Also it shows the disposition of the soviet people towards the changes in the country . "
The people of Russia are becoming masters of their destiny .
The uncontrolled powers of unconstitutional organs have been considerably limited , and this includes party organs . "
This coup had a big resonance among the American society ; consequently the US mass - media were eager to know the feelings of the US citizens about the situation in the Soviet Union .
The US citizen deemed the crisis as a menace for the liberalisation of society ; they assumed it as an actual barrier for the expression of people 's will . "
In the hearts of many Americans , the cold war finally ended this week " , the New York Times wrote .
The press accentuated that many of Americans dusted off fears left over from the Cold War were harshly reminding that this is still the nuclear age .
The dissolution of the Communist party has also become one of most popular issues among American mass - media .
The reduction of Gorbachov 's role and the growth of the Yeltsin 's haven't been out of the attention in the US media sources .
Russian President Boris Yeltsin proposed a radical restructuring of the Soviet Union that would minimize the role of Mikhail Gorbachev and reduce the USSR to a loose confederation of nine republics . "
The Communist Party , which has had control for 74 years , is rapidly dissolving - the Chicago Tribune wrote .
The US mass - media followed the reaction on the crisis inside Communist party closely One of the articles of the Washington post " Soviet Turmoil Shakes Europe 's Communists " tells that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev 's call for dissolution of the Communist Party Central Committee has called into question the survival of its satellite parties in Western Europe .
The dissolution of the Communist party was concerned as the one of the features of the Soviet Union collapse .
In the Washington Post the editorial remarks that the failure of the Moscow coup has finally broke the influence of the Communist Party over the power structures and the world outlook of Soviet people .
As a result , the Soviet Union has been disintegrated along traditional ethnic lines .
The upshot of the matter is that the dissolution of the Soviet Union has caused the formation of the new states and following referendums on their independence .
The leaders of Russia , Ukraine and Belarus formally announced the dissolution of the Soviet Union on Dec 8 , 1991 and agreed to establish a " Commonwealth of Independent States " instead .
The official collapse of the Soviet Union has occurred in December 1991 .
On the 25th of December 1991 Gorbachov has officially resigned .
The Washington Post has written down : " a spokesman for Russian President Boris Yeltsin said that the Soviet Union will cease to exist by the end of 1991 .
Soviet President Gorbachev agreed to the dissolution of all Soviet agencies " .
Soviet époque , which had existed for 74 years , came to its end and this paved the way for establishment of new independent republics .
REPORT
" What young people are interested in ? "
INTRODUCTION
As requested I interviewed a large number of young people , trying to understand their main interests , especially as regards music , TV programmes and clothes .
MUSIC
Many people aged between fourteen and eighteen said that the most listened music among teenagers is definitely rock music .
However , some of them admitted their interest also for pop music and RNB .
Only a few youngsters listen to classical music and love the Opera .
TV PROGRAMMES
The people I interviewed are very keen on reality shows like " Big Brother " and similar but I have to say that many of them are also interested in cooking shows and documentaries .
CLOTHES
Finally , regarding to the clothes , young people declared to prefer casual outfits like jeans , t - shirts etc .
Only a few of them like to wear fashionable clothes .
CONCLUSION
In the whole , I think that young people have now a large variety of interests .
Some of them are pretty similar to those we had in the past ; others are completely different and very interesting to explore .
This house believes that everyone should be able to speak English .
A world where everybody is able to communicate in the same language - is that pure utopia or may it be a considerable idea ?
What would the possible advantages and disadvantages of a world wide spoken language be ?
Establishing English as the new worldwide spoken language might be a favourable example since English is already spoken by more than 300 million native speakers and therefore the third most spoken language in the world , according to Ethnologue .
Moreover English is already a universal language used by many people to communicate or negotiating within the business market .
Imagining everyone had the opportunity to learn and therefore communicate with each other in a worldwide spoken language is certainly an appealing idea and would , without doubt , have many benefits .
Firstly , as mentioned before , it would give everyone the opportunity to communicate with everyone .
However , the realisation of English as a world language would certainly need an educational basis for everyone which might not be easy to accomplish but it would be possible .
While teaching everyone English it would also be profitable to instruct basic knowledge in mathematics , physics or other relevant topics which might be helpful .
Such a standardised educational system for every single person on the world would therefore not only benefit the communication or existing businesses but also help third - world countries to start companies , trade and industrialise their countries so they can take care of themselves and emerge out of poverty .
Moreover , the standardised educational system would also need people who teach and instruct others so the world language will be established everywhere .
In order to accomplish this endowment there would be a necessity of teachers which leads to many new job opportunities .
After all , a couple of professions might become extinct , for example translators , but , therefore , the organisation and execution of this big project would provide a range of other jobs which can make up for the ones lost .
The educational system would also provide a valuable basis for the world of politics so conflicts might be prevented due to the lost language barrier with its vulnerability and risks of misunderstandings .
In addition , civil wars or catastrophes like the Arab spring might also be avoided since there will be an educational standard which could teach different ways of political leadership .
However , this great improvement still holds a few weaknesses .
On the one hand there would be a great loss of cultures and in some cases the implementation of the educational system might be impossible , for instance the aboriginal people .
Anyway , , those tribes would not even need or want an education or a world language because it is their way of life to live in groups together with the nature and disturbing these cultural groups would simply be unnecessary .
On the other hand the suggestion of English as the world wide spoken language might be up against much criticism since the United States do not have many supporters everywhere .
Nevertheless , English was just a suggestion and other languages like Spanish or Chinese could certainly be used as well .
Nowadays , more and more people are learning how to drive , as driving one 's own car is , as everyone knows , much more convenient than taking public transport .
The future that lies ahead for public transport seems to be a bleak one .
But is it really the case ?
Is it really that the end of public transport is soon to come ?
I hold an opposite view ; my answer is " no " , for sure .
Without doubt , having our own car provides us with great convenience .
However , we should not overlook the fact that not everyone can afford a car .
Some people may argue that we can buy a second - hand car if we ca n't afford a brand new one .
Yes , they are right in saying so and in fact , many people are second - hand car owners .
But they seem to have forgotten the extra cost incurred by maintenance and repair , and , of course , buying petroleum .
The cost of having a car is hence not as cheap as we think if we also take into account those avoidable extra cost .
Under this circumstance , some people may rather take public transport to save money for their " dream house " rather than buying a car .
Not to mention that there are tourists in Hong Kong , who have no choice but to use public transport .
It is clearly seen that there is still much room for survival for public transport .
Secondly , even people have cars , they may also take public transport .
As we all know , Hong Kong is famous for scarcity of land , there are not many parking spaces available , so employees may not be granted an official parking space by their company are hence may resort to public transport if they want to avoid the fees of using the parking lot .
Having scarce land is not the sole problem in Hong Kong .
Hong Kong is also famous for its heavy traffic , which implies the problem of traffic congestion .
By taking MTR , one can save all the hassles of wasting precious time being stuck in a traffic jam .
Besides saving time , taking public transport can also help reduce the emission of greenhouse gases .
Greenhouse gases have already posed grave threat to humans , e.g. global warming and ozone depletion , which raised people 's environmental awareness .
People are becoming more and more aware of the importance of environmental protection and want to contribute to saving our Earth .
In this regard , they may take public transport instead of driving their own car even if they have one .
Hence , contrary to many people perceive , there should be an increasing demand , i.e. a rosy future , for public transport .
From the reasons mentioned above , it is obvious that the doomsday of public transport is definitely not something down the line .
But how about the future further far away ?
Maybe .
Like our ancestors would have never imagined that we can now fly in the sky by plane .
Technological advancement is , after all , always something that drops us a bombshell , so rapid that we can never predict how far it can go .
Maybe one day we need no cars , or public transport .
Simply by thinking of a specific location , we can go there in a split second .
Who knows ?
Hi Harry
It 's good to know that you 'll be in the shop next Saturday while I 'm away in Lugo .
There 's not much work you have to do on a normal day , but maybe this will be a special one , because of the match between Celta and Real Madrid that is going to be celebrated half a kilometre away .
First , you need to know how to open the establishment .
I asked for my right - hand employee David to come earlier due to your arrival .
He 'll be in front of the place at 8.30 , just 15 minutes earlier than we open the doors .
The problem is David 's shift ends at 14:00 , so he wo n't be with you in the evening , when we usually lock up at 20:00 .
Once you close it , it would be great if you could let the keys in David 's house , which is in the same building .
There is about 14 workers in the shop , divided in 2 groups with different schedule each one .
They have similar skills and productivity , but , honestly , I prefer working with the morning one . I do n't think you 'll have any problem with both groups .
If there is any problem with the cash registrer ( very common , actually ) , you have a phone number under it of a good technician .
The bill will be assumed by us .
Write back soon and let me know if you have any concern .
All the best

Change frequently creates a great deal of suspicion and mistrust in us .
However , it is one of the most motivating challenge in our lives .
To start with , it is an essential feature in our lives .
They are in constant adaptation to new events or personal experiences .
For example , a close relationship or a serious illness make us look at the world around us through different eyes , and also they let us grow into more interesting and nicer human beings .
Even so , change can be perceived as a disturbing question due to the fact that it provokes a strong feeling of uncertainty .
Often , dealing with new situations does not help us to feel comfortable .
Furthermore , we sometimes feel scared to face new experience and then we can lose a perfect opportunity to improve ourselves .
In short , I consider that change is always the best way to develop our personality to become better people in any aspect of our lives because it represents a major challenge .
It is true that sometimes it is hard to accept certain changes but we can always learn something useful from them .

Nowadays , there 's more to school than sitting quietly at the desk and saving mathematical equations .
Classes are being held much more interactive than in the previous years , and also subjects are supposed to prepare pupils for adult life .
In the following essay I want to discuss the most useful skills which should be taught in school from an early age on .
First of all , it is essential for young people to learn how to take care of themselves , such as knowing how to cook .
Fast food has become part of everyday life .
In order to prevent the younger generation of our society of consuming it , we should give them the possibility to attend cooking classes .
Not only is it an advantage for their health if they 're able to create healthy meals , but also does it strengthen relationships among classmates , as they might help and support each other while trying new dishes .
Moreover , it is a welcome distraction from the theoretical school routine .
However , there 's still a more important area to have a good knowledge about - personal finance .
Some families may be able to afford money and do n't think about its value .
Passing this attitude on to their children , they wo n't be able to save money for emergencies and deal with it reasonably , which is a necessity in order to survive .
Teachers can take up the role of the parents and giving them a knowledge about finances and the right way to handle it .
To conclude , there are a lot of things worth considering to teach in school .
The two most useful , in my opinion , are cooking classes and personal finance .
Both of them are skills which help managing your life later on , finances in particular .
Jake is a free lance .
He uses to travel from place to place following the most burning news around the world .
As a free lance , he has to invest in his ideas , hoping that someone will like his stories and buy them .
To fly in different continents is nowadays easy but still expensive .
Therefore , Jake tries to arrange his stays with one goal in mind : travelling in a comfortable way but saving as much as possible .
A few months ago month he had been spending two weeks in Brussels .
He was following an important European summint on environmental issues .
Brussels , Europe 's capital , made his stay very pleasant .
Jake was able to enjoy its multicultural environment and its great cultural initiatives .
He could easily move from place to place at very convenient prices .
Access to sevreal public transport services ( such as underground , buses , tram , etc . )
let him reach his working meeting always on time .
He also had the chance to know more about the diverse atmosphere characterizing each and every Brussels ' suburb .
During winter Brussels might be quite cold .
However , metros and buses are equipped with such a powerful heating systems that you forget about the cold .
A few weeks later , Jake had to travel to the South of Italy to follow the case of immigrants reaching the coasts of Europe via sea from Africa and the Middle - East .
He was so excited about that trip .
Italy is his parents ' country of origin and it was the first time for him to visit Italy .
He was able to reach the South by a connection flight from Rome .
It was spring , the prefect time to go and visit South of Italy .
Nevertheless , his stay was not as pleasant as he had thought .
Jake 's main challenge was to move around and reach the places he had planned to visit both for his research and for tourist purposes .
He soon came to realise how disorganised public transport is in the South of Italy .
Its inhabitants move around exclusively on their own cars .
Towns are congested by traffic jam , especially during rush hours .
He was surprised by the poor quality of the air when walking around .
The air was polluted by smog due to the huge number of cars .
Jake could only move around by using the few expensive taxis available .
Such experience made Jake realise the considerable impact that a good public transport system has on people 's life and their surrouding .
In particular , an efficient public transport impacts on :
Stress - it makes your life easier since you avoid driving in the middle of traffic jam
Communications - it eases movements from place to place
Environment - it reduces cars on the roads , therefore air is less polluted
Your own and your community 's pockets ! ?
- access to public transport is way cheaper than taking care of your own car ; though initially it might look like a huge disbursment of money from the community , in the long term it shows to be the most efficient way to travel !
Seville is well known for its stunning monuments .
Although , I have been struck by its major draws such as Plaza De Espana , Real Alcazar and El Torre del Oro , this is the relaxed and social way of living which has most impressed me .
Therefore , it all comes down in this writing to expressing feelings about Seville and its surrounding .
First and foremost , it is difficult to feel deep emotions when it comes to living in a place without real social contact .
Therefore , I miss my close - knit family and friends .
I 'm having a very nice time in Seville though .
In fact , the more I know about its organization and its people , the more I feel at ease in Seville .
It is almost as if I were at home now .
I must well admit this has not always been so .
To be honest , I was not very attracted by the spirit of the city at the very beginning of my stay .
In my opinion , Seville was rather disorganized and not very charming and its citizens rather rude .
Consequently , what are the reasons of my change of heart ?
In my view , getting to know a city is quite similar to getting to know people .
The more I understand it the more I like it .
Of course , it may happen at times that I dislike what I discover !
Luckily , this has not been the case so when it comes to Seville .
This is partly due to the fact I have picked up a few words which enable me to interact more easily with its citizens .
For example , people start to talk with me when they notice I make efforts to speak in their language .
There are even some smiles and laughs , which is very reassuring for someone who is alone abroad .
What 's more , Seville is bright , colourful and lively which cheers me up and relaxes me .
For instance , I spent some time last night eating tapas on a small street in a laid - back atmosphere .
I was surrounded by joyful Spaniards who were speaking loudly .
Needless to say , I greatly enjoyed this time as it made me feel as if I were part of their life and of the place .
To make matters even better , there was some music played a few meters ahead , which contributed to liven up the spirit of everyone present there .
In addition to this , I really like sharing tapas dishes with people , drinking a good fresh " draft beer " and going for a " tapas crawl " with friends as in Switzerland each one gets its own dish when eating out and only go for a " pub crawl " .
I am also keen on wandering off at my own pace and getting lost on the winding narrow cobbled streets as I feel like an adventurer looking for new treasures .
Some of these are striking secluded places such churches or Moorish - styled houses .
Thus , scouring Seville is like rewinding the time and being propelled in the past .
On account of all this , it is easy to understand why my perception of Seville has significantly changed over time .
As far as I 'm concerned , the city is no longer a museum displaying sumptuous and ostentatious monuments .
It turns out to be now a very welcoming and relaxing place where warm - hearted people live and where I greatly enjoy spending some time .
WHAT AN AMAZING COINCIDENCE !
Have you ever witnessed the collapse of a myth and the birth of a new star at the same time ?
This year , in Italy , for the first time in more than 200 years , it happened a weird coincidence : the political leader Silvio Berlusconi and the singer Ligabue marked their careers on the same day .
On the one hand , Berlusconi compromised his position when some journalists told the world some wiretappings of his which would compromise his future political career ; on the other , Luciano Ligabue won the award for the best song of the year , bringing his career ever forward .
Unbelievable as it may seem , this is really a bizarre coincidence .
Dear Jo ,
It 's great to get some news from you .
What a lucky man you are to have a year free !
If I had also a year free , I would only prefer travelling not working .
Switzerland is really a great place for travelling . You should plan two different periods to visit sightseeing places , one in summer and the other one in winter .
Famous sightseeing places are really different during winter and summer .
If you decide to ground in Geneva , I suggest you to visit first the north of Switzerland from the west to the east and then the south of Switzerland from the east to the west .
Switzerland is a small country also take your time and spend enough time in each place .
Concerning your inquiry on working in my country , it 's really difficult to get an authorisation to work , especially for periods longer than a week .
Therefore , I suggest you to work during your travelling time .
For instance if you plan to stay more than one week in Zermat in Wallis , think to try to find a place where you could help in a restaurant or a shop .
But if you prefer to work during a full three - month period , you should ask your employer a work permit .
In any case , do n't hesitate to visit me and my family in Lausanne .
I look forward to seeing you during your trip .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Twenty minutes had passed , but Sarah was still inside the house .
He started to bite his nails , restless .
She said that she would go out in five minutes .
What if she was in trouble ?
What if the owner of the house has caught her ?
Five more minutes went by , and he decided to get into the bungalow .
He climbed the tree clumsily and managed to enter through the open window .
It was a dark night , so he could barely see .
-There is no need for you to climb through the window , like a thief - said a soft voice .
The shock made Peter gasp .
Before him there was a tall , dark woman in black .
He had n't seen her when he had gone into the room .
His eyes were adjusted to the darkness now , so he could recognize her .
--Tris .
Tris ' smile became bigger .
-It has been a long time , Peter .
May I ask you why you are breaking into my house instead of knocking at the door ?
How rude of you !
There was no anger in her voice , but amusement and something else that Peter could not distinguish .
-Where is Sarah ?
She must be here .
Tris 's smile faded away .
- You are the only person that came here in the last five hours , Peter .
Unless ...
The silence that followed her words was oppressive .
They both know what would happen if Tris 's husband found out a stranger in his house .
- I must find her before he does it .
Please , help me find her .
She could be in danger .
Tris sighed .
--Sorry , my friend , but I 'm not gon na face my husband again .
This time , you are on your own .
First of all , the public transport is obsolete .
Take a look at the highways near the big cities .
They are full of cars each and every day .
If there were a future for public transport , that would n't happen .
Travelling by car gives you independence .
You are not tied to the timetable of the public transport .
You can choose when you would like to go .
You can also choose where you would like to go .
Finally you can choose who would travel with you .
Those are great advantages everyone can see .
Right now we have a problem : the oil reserves are depleting .
That is going to happen sooner rather than later .
It could seem to point towards public transport , nevertheless it will push car travelling even further .
The reason is that , once we are free from our oil shackles , we will say farewell to most of its problems .
There will be no more greenhouse gasses , you can forget about escalating gas prices and , finally , you will not remember air pollution .
Last but not least , we are entering a digital era .
Computers and smartphones are becoming more prominent in our lives .
Why would I travel to a meeting in a different city when I can meet through Skype ?
I can not find the reason .
It 's a waste of time and other resources .
In summary , the public transport is dying .
We need to embrace the advances of technology and we will be free of those terrible experiences .
I enjoy watching soap operas on TV and the best one for me is EastEnders .
This TV serial is mainly based on working class people and represents various ethnic minority communities including African and Asian Muslims .
This show is particularly good as it represents how people from different ethnic backgrounds can engage with each other .
It shows that ethnic minority people can integrate with the majority Caucasian people without losing their cultural and traditional values .
In addition , it provides an opportunity for people from different backgrounds to peep into the culture and traditions of British people .
Although this soap involves a lot of cheating and plotting between characters , it also shows the importance of family values . I would definitely recommend this drama serial to other people .
It is important to gain awareness about different societies due to the fact that Britain is becoming such a multicultural society .
To travel around the world has always been my dream since I was a little boy .
However , what is the best means of transportation to see the world for yourself ?
As far as I am concerned , I would prefer to travel by boat .
A couple of good reasons are behind my choice .
First , to travel by boat is a very relaxing and carefree experience , compared to being confined to a very narrow and limited little space on the seat of a plane .
Second , people on the boats are granted the opportunity to see beautiful ocean lives , while taking a plane does n't provide this luxury to take a look at the birds in the sky for planes are travelling at such a high speed .
Third , when it comes to travel , what really matters is not your destination .
From my perspective , it is the process that is more valuable .
Therefore , I would choose to lengthen the process of travelling , and a comfortable voyage on the sea would certainly become my first choice , since it guarantees a long and pleasant travelling experience .
I am writing to complain about the suggested bar on smoking in public areas .
I work in Café Noir , a well - known restaurant , popular with visitors in the centre of town .
I am very concerned about this proposal , for a number of reasons .
Firstly , I do not understand why this is being implemented so quickly and why there has been no discussion - there is no time for anyone to feel comfortable with the idea .
Secondly , it is unthinkable to suggest it in outdoor bars and restaurants - such an idea is completely unworkable .
To support my argument against this proposal I would like to explain what happened when the authorities attempted to introduce a ban on smoking in my home town .
It was unsuccessful , and the politicians had to reverse their decision .
In the first place , few people did know about this law , and , of course , most business opposed the idea .
A non - smoking policy was introduced by some restaurants ; the consequences were terrible : a large number of their customers vanished .
If this happened in café Noir , probably I could lose my job .
In my opinion , introducing specific non - smoking areas in this type of establishments could be an excellent idea .
This would appear to be a better solution .
Dear Margaret ,
Firstly , thank you for answering and do n't worry about the delayed reply !
Secondly , I 'd like to tell you some things about myself as well .
It 's not easy for me to talk about myself , but I 'll give my best .
I 've been living in Augsburg for nearly two years now and am studying B.A. Anglistik and economics .
Before moving to Augsburg , I studied biology for two semesters in Erlangen , but soon noticed that it was n't the right subject of study for me .
So I switched and I 'm happy to say that it was the right decision !
Biology is still a hobby of mine , but I 've always been good with languages and so I 'm doing now something I 'm naturally good at .
I can speak English and of course German - and because my grandparents are from Korea , a little Korean , too .
I am the only grandchild that ca n't speak Korean properly because I grew up in Bavaria and not in NRW , but they taught me to cook .
It started when I was a little child , and it 's what I do .
When I 'm stressed or trying to postpone things like studying or cleaning the flat , I cook .
Sharing my flat with two boys is amusing most of the time , but when it 's about cleaning … oh my !
The good thing is : the rest of the time living with boys is as uncomplicated as it gets .
And we 're a pretty good team because all of my cooking led to many evenings spent together in our kitchen .
My other big hobby is travelling .
I 've been to Jamaica , Morocco , the Maldives and Curacao .
Also I visited the USA multiple times : I travelled the west coast from San Diego to San Francisco , I 've been to Las Vegas , Chicago and Boston .
In less than two weeks , I 'm going to fly to New York City .
I 'm so excited !
So , now you have a rough summary of me .
I 'm looking forward to working with you and wish you all the best until then !
See you soon ,
Sarah

There is no sport like football .
It is an activity that requires many people , which improves your social skills and your overall ability to manage a group .
It demands physical effort , being and excellent way to keep fit .
It involves many moral virtues , which makes football one of the best activities for teenagers .
Starting with the social skills , it is obvious that a football match is a dispute , a game we involve in with the intention to win .
This kind of action , when peformed collectively , requires coordenation of efforts and abitity to work together , two qualities that are frequently forgotten in our individualistic world .
If you play footbal , you know how to act when in a team .
Moreover , footbal is a physical game .
Unlike chess or bridge , football makes you leap , run , kick .
In times of escalators and cars , it is refreshing to find an activity that involves movement , velocity and strenght .
And if you do decide to take it seriously , this sport will put you through workouts and sustained practices that are going to make you really fit .
Finally , football involves relationships in moments of tension , and this is the natural context for virtues like justice , courage and honesty .
In fact , it can be argued that the human virtues are a by - product of conflicts and fights ; that they are that traces of character that we aknowledge as important for everybody engaged in a competition , be it for a trophy or for a country .
It is a sport that develops no only the body , but also the mind and the heart .
If you want to try it , you should find a club near you .
It is easy , because football is one of the most popular sports in the western world .
In a club you will find professional advice and also as many peopole as it is necessary for a match .
In fact , if football has a downside , it is this , the fact that you need twenty - two people to set a match .
But , provided that , you will have one of the best ninety minutes of your entire life .

I have a strong belief that being multilingual is essential for working in the financial industry and Mandarin is an important language for working in Asia - Pacific countries .
To further improve my Chinese , I enrolled for the Post - Intermediate Mandarin class during my undergraduate study , in which I achieved a First - Class result .
Beyond my academic disciplines , I have consistently taken up some active roles at university and outside school to further develop my interpersonal and leadership skills .
I was trained as a PASS ( Peer Assisted Study Session ) leader for econometrics to provide some academic support to some younger students at my final year of study at Manchester .
I attended trainings and workshops to learn about the skills to be a good facilitator before the start of the academic year .
The regular meetings with my group of students to discuss their questions on econometrics have developed my empathy which is a crucial skill of being a leader .
Besides , I have undertaken an internship at the HSBC Risk in order to gain an insight into the banking industry and learn how to work with my peers in a business environment .
I have gained a better understanding of the role credit risk plays in the full picture of banking operations .
A Real Vacation and A Dream Vacation
To me , a vacation is a specific trip or journey for recreation or tourism .
And I usually spend my vacation with my family during school break .
However , there are two kinds of vacation , a real vacation and a dream vacation .
One summer vacation , I went on a trip to Paris with my family .
It was a 10-day trip .
And we had booked all our hotels in advance .
It seemed to be a dream vacation .
But it turned out to be totally different when I arrived there .
It was in the afternoon when we arrived .
When I walked out the airport , I was attracted by the beautiful scenery .
The streets , the cafés and the people formed a beautiful picture .
At night , I expected to have a romantic French dinner at a posh restaurant .
But no , instead of sitting in a restaurant , my mum took us to a supermarket to get some sandwiches for dinner .
In the next following days , we mostly had bread and sandwiches for our meals .
And we had only water when we were thirsty .
During these 10 days , we walked a lot instead of catching a bus , because it saved money too .
But it made my legs sore every night .
This is kind of the real vacation for me .
Even though I was in a romantic city , I could n't enjoy my vacation in a romantic way due to the low budgets we had .
To me , a dream vacation is like going to a beautiful island like Palau , where I can enjoy the sunshine and the sea .
And I would like to go there with my boyfriend .
When I am there , I would start my day by calling room service for a wonderful breakfast in bed .
After , I would head to the sandy beach and relax in the sun , feeling the breeze .
As the day goes on , I would also go swimming in the deep blue sea , go snorkeling or just lie on the beach .
Lying on the beach is very relaxing and it is the perfect thing to do on vacation .
Once the sun goes down , I would hit the bars to have some drinks and enjoy the nightlife .
And I would always have my meals at some luxurious restaurants .
This is the kind of dream vacation I want so bad .
Vacations should be relaxing , not tiring .
There are always the differences between a real vacation and a dream vacation .
And it is all on account of the budgets we have .
Once I have enough money , I will have my dream vacations come true .
From now on , I will save my money to turn all my vacations into my dream vacations .
When I finished the high school , I started working as accountant in my father 's carpentry .
He produces doors and windows on wood .
At the beginning it was really difficult to me because I was a little shy with customers and I was n't used to working among noisy machinery and shouting workers , but after a while time I learned to ignore all of that !
Very soon I realized that this job was n't for me .
I was working in a very small country and my office was isolated , so I did n't have any contact with other people and my job started to get boring .
It took me 12 years to get the courage to quit because it was my family company and I felt really sorry , but I had to grow up and improve my professional skills , so I began to look for a new job .
When I received an email from a company based in the centre of Milan , I was really excited !
My father was happy because it was a great opportunity and understood that it was what I 've been dreaming for a long time .
Five years have passed and I 'm still working for this company which has given me a lot and I 've been learning many things about accounting .
In fact I am administrative manager and I feel really proud of myself .
I meet lots of people every day and I have the chance to talk to smart people .
Last but not least I 'm a great fashion expert because I work near the shopping streets !

There has never been a bigger force for change than technology , it changes absolutely everything about the way we live , even the way we talk with each other .
Despite the rise of social media , the idea of community has changed radically , because people are sharing interests everywhere on the planet .
Social Media such as Twitter , Facebook , Youtube and blogs illustrate surely that the definition or repercussion of digital technologies is created through the forms in which they are worn and the social relations and associations that expand around them .
This essay will discuss the implications of social media for everyday life , emphasizing the problems which arose with the use of Facebook and Twitter .
Finally it will look into possible future implications of this kind of technoogy .
Social networks websites can be explained as a web usefulness that admit people to create a public or semi - public profile , arrange a list of other contacts which is possible to share connection and look and cross their list of connections and those made by others within the system .
Namen and Kinnison ( 2012 ) indicates that " the three types of social interactions that social networking enables include ( 1 ) creaction of an online identity , ( 2 ) establishment of relationships between users , and ( 3 ) development of layered communities defined by the lists of connections each user establishes " .
One of the most popular social networking websites is Facebook .
Another rapidly expanding social networking is Twitter .
These kinds of websites allows people to interact with others precisely by smartphones or computers .
By Twitter , users post opinions or comments narrow to 140 characters .
On the other hand , on Facebook people can share pictures , vídeos and thoughts without restrictions .
As a result of an appropriate use of social networking tools in education , Javanovic , Chiong and Weise ( 2012 ) demonstrate that students adopt Facebook not especially for socialising but also for academic purposes , like to obtain benefit for their studies or to recover time in discovering learning resources ( p.39 ) .
Furthermore , some departments of police in the USA used Facebook to share a vídeo of a felony with the expectancy to identify the suspects and their followers were apt to say something about the incident in return to the publication .
Additionally , a politician from Philadelphia , USA was elected after take advantage of his Twitter account appropriately during his campaign .
My most memorable learning experience to date was my marriage .
My ex - husband taught me not to be involved with some kind of people by analyzing his behavior before commitment .
During our dating he was very charming and attentive .
We discussed about some sexist ideas that I do n't agree with what the society demands on people and I noticed a little sexism of him , but I was fine with that because That can happen , but due to my profession he could n't be like that for so long because I was in a man 's shoes .
He was very jealous but I thought it would fade away with time and with the gaining of the trust but it did not and ended up making me sick by the time passed .
I learned that a man does anything to conquer a woman , he even does a lot of hateful things for him such as going to her home every night to stay together or to hang out , while later you find out that he hates going to places except his house .
I learned a man says anything just to shut you up and not discuss just to have some love moments .
He does not end an argument and give a position to understand your point , he thinks he is right and does not want to think about it .
I also learned that men think in a different way from the women during the day .
For example , while women think about millions things like what they want to do or have to do during the day , while men just do nto think about anything and can be like that for hours , just whith a blank mind .
But in my opinion this should be an excuse to think something that women should n't know anything about .
I also learned that is the mother that gives the principles and the direction of a man 's mind , and depending on her he is going to be a sexist or not , he is going to help and be an honor man or not , he is going to be a good and caring father or not , he is going to be a responsible human being or not .
A mother is very fundamental and the basis for the men principles and beliefs .
Women do not knoe their importance for the future on their own homes .
They teach the same things over and over again and do not rethink if those beliefs and actions are really right to help the world change and be a better world for everyone .
Once upon a time there was a majestuous kingdom in England , surrounded by beautiful rivers , waterfalls and mountains .
Everyone lived peacefully and harmoniously until one day , at the welcoming ball in honour of the little princess , a horrendous witch showed up and cursed the little princess named Sophie , who would die at the age of 16 and only a kiss of true love would save her .
Princess Sophie grew up , she was so unhappy because she could n't do anything , she was condemned to live in a room of the castle until someone could find the cure for her cursed .
One day she figured out how to escape through a hidden passage , she got to the town and ran and jump , she did every little thing she was n't aloud to since so long .
While she was having some fun , a handsome boy crashed her and she fall to the ground .
As only a gentleman would do , he apologised and introduced himself to the Princess :
- I am so sorry Madam , excuse me for my blunder .
I am Michael .
The princess was a little scared of talking to someone she did n't know , because she never got to talk to anyone before , but still she answer him with a big smile - You are excused , my name is Sophie.- It truly was love at first sight .
Michael asked her to go with him for an ice cream so he could amend his fault .
Sophie accepted and they started a strong friendship that through the time became in more than just a friendship , they fall in love for each other .
Princess Sophie used to escape so she could meet with Michael , until one day , when she was just about to meet Michael to confess him all the truth about who she really was , a guards discovered her and the King commanded to lock her up in her room .
Michael was disappointed because he thought that Princes Sophie did n't love him anymore .
Princess Sophie send him a lot of letters telling him the truth about her , and about her cursed .
But after Michael read the first letter , and found out that Sophie was a princess , he thought he was just a game for her .
He did n't want to read the next letters , in which Princess Sophie said he was the love of her life and also wrote about the curse .
Michael decided to leave the kingdom , when he was just about to close the door he turned back to his coffee table and saw the letters , he had a hunch but he ignored it .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he has made a mistake .
I believe that saying that there is no future for public transport given that travelling by car is so much more convenient , is premature . We need to consider a lot of factors before we can make a judgement of this kind .
What happens in future will be decided by what happens now .
We have already heard about how pollution is killing our planet earth , gradually .
People are advised to carpool and travel to work places .
Several announcements over radio and TV emphasize the need to use the public transport system for travelling to save nature .
Yet , not many pay heed to the message .
People may choose to ignore the advice now but in future they may not have a choice .
It is only a matter of time before we reach a tipping point with respect to the limited natural resources that we have .
Then we may have no choice but to use public transport as much as we can for travel .
One of the latest film I have seen is Silver Linings Playbook , played by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence .
It 's a comedy with romantic features and at the same time very realistic .
There are family problems , football madness , romantic obsessions and mental illnesses .
The plot is about a young man ( Bradley Cooper ) who has just been discharged from a psychiatric hospital and has moved to his parents home .
He was accused of mistreating his wife and that is the reason why they had been separated for the last eight months .
The problem is that he has an obsession : he wants to get back with his wife although he ca n't talk to her as the police have forbidden him .
His neighbour is a young woman ( Jennifer Lawrence ) who has been widowed for 2 years .
She has a turbulent and complicated past .
They meet by chance and started a tortuous relationship as friends .
Interestingly , they find the way to help each other and not surprisingly finally they fall in love .
I personally think that the film transmit an interesting view of the psychiatric illnesses and the importance of the family in this type of problems .
I strongly recommend you to go and see the film .
Introduction
The aim of this report is to present young people 's interests in my country .
It gives information about their tastes in music , TV programmes and clothes .
Music
A revival of rock music has been seen in the past 10 - 15 years .
So , naturally , about half of the teenagers and young adults prefer rock and roll , hard rock and progressive rock to other genres .
They enjoy both local bands ' production and some foreign songs .
About one third of the rest would claim they listen mainly to pop folk , whereas the rest would be interested in R&B , soul and jazz .
Television
Although not many young people like spending their free time watching TV , I believe that some patterns of preference can still be recognized .
Except classics like Friends , popular shows include How I Met Your Mother , The Big Bang and the new HBO talk show Last Week Tonight . I can say with high certainty that reality TV is no more in with young people in my country .
Clothes
Most teens tend to create their unique style , often managing to start a fashion of their own .
Designer clothes are not what they look for anymore .
Conclusion
This information can help the organizers of next year 's festival in choosing appropriate music and catering to a variety of tastes .
Hello Sarah !
How have you been ? I 'm writing you this letter because I think I found the perfect flat for you .
My friend Peter recently told me that he was moving out from his flat , so I asked him if he was willing to rent it .
And guess what ...
He said yes .
It 's a third floor apartment right in the middle of the city .
It has two bedrooms , a kitchen and a very large bathroom .
The house is already equipped with everything you might need and furniture so all you need to do is pack up your things and move !
Tell me what you think about it .
Bye , Sofia
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I would like to express my total dissatisfaction with your latest measures .
You changed the time of the Japanese lessons from the evening to the afternoon , when I am actually at work .
So if I want to come to the lesson , I have to postpone all my projects to a later time .
Furthermore you will increase the course fee by 15% from next month .
I have to say , I am really upset about these changes .
In the future , you do not provide the Japanese course at convenient time .
So you will provide a worse service for more money from next month .
I am very sorry but I can not accept this !
If you do not change your policies or give me a personal discount , I will leave your school .
I would appreciate it if you took these possibilities into consideration .
I expect a quick response from you .
Yours faithfully
Vivien Alberta
Recently I watched a film called " The Sixth Sense " , and I 'd totally recommend it to anyone older than 13 .
The movie is set in the United States around the 1990 's , so we could say the film is technically modern , though I 'm sure that in some years it will be considered a classic .
It 's about the story of a little boy that is haunted by a big secret , he is visited by ghosts .
His mother does n't know about this , but she is worried about him .
So she decides to take him to a child psychologist .
The boy soon becomes friends with the psychologist , and he started noticing plenty of things about this exceptional boy .
I 'm not normally keen on thrillers , but this is definitely a must watch .
The boy 's acting is really something , such a thing that his acting earned him a nomination for the Academy Awards .
I found this movie both exciting and emocional , both thumbs up for me !
Funding proposal
As the secretary of the English Language club i am writing to propose that our club be given funding for the coming year .
Outline of the club activity
The Club has many social and cultural programs .
We regulary organise film projections and discussions around a subject related to the film .
We also invite guest speakers and organise fun events .
Benefits for the students
Many students gain a great deal from our activities .
For example , with every film seen our students have the chance to practice their language and to develop their own opinions , particularly as we always have discussions aroud a subject related to the film .
Also our monthly speakers are exellent , for example , last year we invited a well - known actrice , Janet Hewitt , to share some of her experience on Broadway .
Unfortunalety , organising this kind of events is costly and the money from membership fees is not enough .
Benefits for the college
We also believe the college benefits from our Club .
Being founded in 1920 by our well - known alimni , John Carter , the English Language Club is the oldest club in our college .
The fact that everyone from the community cand participate at our events is helping us to develop a positive relation between the college and the community .
We hope you will be ablte to take all thisinto account and will find it possible to help us continue and improve our club by funding us .
In my opinion , shopping is not always enjoyable .
What 's more , shopping is almost always unenjoyable .
I just hate it .
The whole process is arduous and nerve - wracking .
I am a homebody type .
Every time , when something compels me to leave my " castle " , I feel under the weather .
Especially , when it comes to go shopping .
It just winds me up .
Shopping centres are located in the city centres , so every road trip lasts ages ( I live in a suburb ) . Thusly , when I get to the mall , I am already bent out of shape .
Afterwards the crowd of people is ramming me , when I 'm trying to walk .
The lightning in shops is obnoxious .
My eyes instantaneously start to hurt .
I 'm not able to find any nice gears .
Although , if I find something cute , it wo n't fit .
And the worst thing - the queues .
I hate them wholeheartedly .
At the end I 'm livid and exhausted .
Thank goodness we live in the internet age and I can do shopping without leaving my bed .
1 . The author compares Easter to a pagan spring festival , because they are associated with happiness .
The way Easter and specifically Good Friday is celebrated is gradually deprived of religious content .
People do n't want to to contemplate Christ 's suffering , but they want to move directly to the cheerful part of Easter celebration , so to Easter Sunday .
2 .
According to the author , people " flinch from consideration of Good Friday " due to three taboos connected with this day : self - sacrifice , suffering and death .
The way self - sacrifice is seen has changed enormously - we no longer want to sacrifice ourselves , because it 's unpopular and it is in contradiction with the idea of consumerism .
What is more , we are becoming indifferent to other people 's suffering and that 's why we are n't willing to think about it , even on Good Friday .
Suffering as well as death is pushed away from our real life - we do n't want to experience them but rather watch it on different kinds of TV shows .
3 . L'Oreal slogan " Because you 're worth it " proves the author 's thinking that we are unwilling to sacrifice ourselves .
In a consumptive lifestyle we want more and more for ourselves , but not for other people , because it will require self - sacrifice .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
It was a hot summer day , everyone was walking to their usual destination ; work , school , buy some groceries , pick up the laundry or their clothes at the cleanners , everyone except Peter .
He was sweating , looking at people in a confusing way .
" Do n't they know what is happening ? "
Suddenly , Peter started to run , while he ran , he looked at his watch , over and over again as if by looking at his watch time would stop .
But this was not the case , time continued to pass by , ever so slowly , making Peter even more nervous .
He stopped at a great big building knowing that the fastest way to get to the top floor of the building was by taking the elevator , but what if the elevator stopped ?
He decided to take the stairs and so he did .
He ran up the stairs as fast as he could .
Half way through his journey , he tripped .
To him , it felt as if time had stopped for a moment , but time , as time always does , kept going .
Peter smiled for a brief moment as he remembered his obsession with Einstein 's Theory of General Relativity , he thought " finally I understand it " .
He calmly stood up , looked at his watch , then closed his eyes and realized that there was nothing else to do .
Nowadays , it is hard for many young people to do physical exercise frequently .
It is a well - known fact that sometimes they prefer watching TV on the sofa or playing computer games comfortably to doing physical activities .
So , it is necessary to find a solution in order to make young people keep fit in a motivated way .
There can be no doubt that technology should be a tool to motivate young people .
It is clear that most of them use computers and watch television almost every day , but while they are doing this they are sitting in a comfortable sofa .
I feel very strongly that computer games could be an enjoyable way to do physical exercise without going out of home .
In the market , you can find a wide range of computer games or video games to keep fit , such as dancing to the rhythm of last hits , playing tennis , doing aerobics , running ...
Moreover , schools can play an important role in kids ' fitness .
It is true that many young people do extra activities related to sports like football or basketball .
Although some schools offer the chance of doing these , many others do not do .
I firmly believe that were the schools to offer kids a greater variety of sports , there can be no doubt that they would do more exercise .
In this way , children could do the sport they prefer as a routine .
To sum up , it is important motivating the young people to do physical exercise .
School programmes and technology could be effective methods to achieve this goal .
It seems to me that school programmes would make young people be encouraged to keep fit because in this way , they do their favourite sport in a routine way .
It all started with jumping over the big black trashcans .
I was 9 years old when it happened for the first time .
Back in the time , when I successfully passed the third grade , my parents decided to let me pick the present that I want as a reward .
The very first thing came to my mind was a pair of inline roller skates ; I used to look out of my window , or sitting on my house 's door step and see my neighbors skating and trying to do some tricks and jumps , and all I wanted was joining them instead of watching them enjoying their times .
My parents took me to TOYS R US to get what I wanted .
I ran to the outdoor toys section and I picked the skate I liked .
I tried couple of sizes to see which one fits more .
I could not be more excited to join my friends .
After that , I went back home , I put them on , and I went outside to skate .
I fell over a hundred times in a few days .
By the time , I got better , and I started to learn how to do tricks and jump over small items .
While skating was a whim for my friends and me in the beginning , I found myself in it .
I knew that skating is the thing I want to do for the rest of my life , the thing I want to tell people about when they ask me what your favorite thing to do is .
In a couple of years , I became much better and I learned to do many tricks like skating backwards , the Snake and the Zigzag .
I learned how to jump over many items , such as chairs and the trashcans that my neighbors used to jump over .
However , that was not enough for me .
I kept trying to know more about skating .
I entered middle school ; I met two friends who also love to skate , Mohammed and Khalid .
We decided to go skating on the next weekend at the park , which has a wide walk path by the sea .
When we met on the weekend , I noticed that they were different ; they have different skates , and different methods of skating , they slid on edges and skated on the park benches .
I realized that this is what I am looking for , a new additional excitement to add to skating .
I had to wait for two months to buy a new pair of skates , but this time it is aggressive skates .
When I started aggressive skating , I had to learn how to balance my weight using heavy two - wheel inline skates .
This kind of skating taught me how to take risks and not to be afraid .
After a while , the group expanded , and we used to go around the town , Yanbu , to search for great edges and rails to slide on .
In addition , we made our own skate rails , and we used some help from my friend 's brother , who is in fact an Engineer .
Once on a weekend , it was my last year in middle school , I was at the park practicing as usual .
I found three people skating , and again , a new kind of skates , and new methods .
Their moves were so smooth ; it was more like a ballet .
I was impressed .
I introduced myself , and as I thought , they were vising from a different city .
We discussed different topics , but mainly skating .
The more we get deep into the conversation , the more I want to learn this type of skating .
It turned out that they were wearing roller hockey skates . "
These skates are light , smooth , and perfect for freestyle slalom skating .
" One of them said .
The words " freestyle " and " slalom " caught my attention .
They showed me what slalom skating is .
They started to put small cones in one line with a bit of space in between .
They played some music and started to skate with the rhythm . I was surprised , I had mixed feeling , and it was indescribable .
I kept staring at them with wide opened mouth and eyes .
The butterfly feeling in my stomach started to appear .
I knew at that moment that I want to change my style of skating .
However , as the skaters suggested , I bought a pair of hockey skates .
I did not have the ability to order the cones online back then , therefore , I went to IKEA , and bought small colored cups and used it as cones .
I went to the same park .
After couple of hours of trying to get used to my new skates , I put the cups on .
I opened some tutorial videos on YouTube and started to practise .
In a short time , I became so good , and some of my friends changed from aggressive to slalom skating just by seeing me practicing .
My guess is they had the same reaction I had when I saw the three skaters .
For me , skating is not just a sport .
After almost 3 years of practicing to do tricks , to create a perfect match between my moves and the rhythm of the song I am playing , and to try to reach the perfection , I realized that slalom skating is more like a performing art than a sport .
A freestyle skater who can make a perfect combo of tricks that matches the rhythm is an artist .
When I stopped looking for enthusiasm , fun , and excitement and started trying to fulfill my heart , brain , and body 's desires by skating , I knew for sure skating is not just a sport or a hobby .
Skating is a lifestyle .
About one year ago , I moved to Philadelphia , United States .
Unlike weather in my country , Philadelphia is always rainy , wet , and sloppy .
This weather was an obstacle , it was impossible to skate in this condition .
However , I was not going to give up on skating that easy .
I had to find something to keep me going , to fulfill the missing part in me .
A friend suggested giving ice skating a shot , and for me , everything worth trying just to be able to skate again .
I went to an ice rink , I rented hockey skates , and I started to skate .
I did not imagine that it would be that similar to roller skating .
What I learned in 10 years , I had the ability to learn it on ice in one month .
It was just a matter of balance .
Today , After 10 years of skating , I wonder sometimes what my life would be without skating . I believe that skating is a huge part of me , Mohammed , and I am positive that if this part was missing , my path in life would have changed and I will never be the same person I am now .

Icebreakers
I was surprised when I realized I was talking too much .
I 'm , usually , not good at talking or any social things .
Whenever I talk with someone I meet for the first time , I often make us fall into awkward silences .
But with him , I 'm ... I 'm different , I 'm the one who often breaks the ice .
Because I want him to talk .
I love to listen him talking - I love his voice .
I try to recall the jokes I 've read in books or on Facebook or blogs and tell him .
I love his laughter , his smile , his chuckle .
I ca n't suffer even a second 's moment of our awkward silences .
However , when we sit in silence , I love to stare at him , reading his face .
Is he feeling bored ?
Is something on his mind ?
I know it .
He 's friendly .
He always smiles when he 's talking .
I once told a friend , " You know ?
He 's very friendly .
He can make friends easily .
Even if you meet him for the first time , his smile can make you feel comfortable . " My friend replied , " Yes , I may feel comfortable around him .
We may become friends in seconds .
But I doubt I can read his face like you do . "
I always want to be with him , talking , laughing , smiling or simply sitting in silence reading his face .
I 'm kind of person who used to think that every hour had a purpose , who had no time to waste , not even a single hour .
I was always having things to do .
But when I 'm with him , they become secondary .
He is the most important to me .
I am happy when I am with him .
I do n't want to do anything else .
Just being with him is enough .
Please , let me follow my heart , at least for the first time in my life .
Advertising is a form of communication that is used to influence and persuade consumers to buy products , services , ideas .
Advertising is most commonly aimed at the manipulation consumer 's behavior in a commercial aspect .
But at the same time advertising has many features in common with art .
Firstly , art is the expression of human creative skills and imagination , typically in a visual form .
And advertising is a combination of sounds , images and words .
Like art it is intended to evoke emotions and feelings .
To be successful advertising often uses images from popular movies , catchy melodies , unusual graphic elements and fragments of famous paintings .
Often people , who are watching a commercial , do not remember what details or elements of other visual art types they have seen before .
Therefore , advertising successfully combines other types of art to influence the subconscious and human behavior .
Secondly , art as well as advertising is such a large part of our everyday lives .
Someone designed all things around : a chair , shoes , clothes .
It is art .
Art is something that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing to people 's eyes .
Hoardings and billboards , which are a part of the urban landscape , are art .
Visual advertising like painting uses color , value , space and line .
There are elements of art .
Also it uses balance , contrast , emphasis and proportion .
There are principles of design .
Lastly , advertising like art originated a long time ago .
Commercial advertising can be traced as far back as Ancient Greece .
There were posters for entertainment , small ads for businesses , merchants used town criers , paying for events .
With the development of mass media , television and Internet advertising has become the strongest form of communication .
Now advertising is a big part of modern culture .
Advertising has similarities with the art and often combines other types of art to be more successful .
Advertising is creative combinations of sounds , images and words .
Modern technologies , the development of mass media are allowed advertising to become the greatest art from the 20th century .
Michael got out of bed on the wrong side that day or , at least , that 's what he thought when , on his way to work , he was so concentrated looking down at his mobile phone that he did n't see a woman approaching him and they both collided .
She was around fifty years old and rather unattractive although smartly dressed .
She did n't see Michael coming either because she had just come out of a Starbuck 's coffee shop right at the corner and was putting her purse back into her massive handbag .
On her left hand there was a large steaming cup of coffee that landed on Michael 's new shirt when he bumpped into her .
One second later , Michael was covered in coffee , burnt and sticky and his mobile phone screen was twinking until it finally turned off with a dying flash .
Michael then remembered how he had overslept that morning , how he did n't have time to have breakfast , how he did n't have any clean shirt ready and had to wear the new one that he was keeping for a special occasion and he blamed that woman for it all .
He screamed , shouted , waved his hands into the air , swore and insulted that stranger until his rage faded away .
And then he rushed away trying not to be late for work .
A couple of hours later , already in his office , he received a call .
The new human resources manager had arrived and wanted to meet every worker in the company personally .
It was his turn now .
He jumped off his chair , walked down the corridor and stopped in front of the HR Manager 's office .
He knocked at the door and when he opened it , he saw , sitting there , the same old lady he had cursed a few hours earlier in the street .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
My article is about a class play .
In this article a teacher refltcts on his experiences of creating plays and using them to help motivate students to develop their English .
It consists of eight part : Introduction ; How to start ; Writing the play ; I want to be Cinderella ; Practise ; The big night ; Reason for doing a play and A few final thoughts .
The author says that the pros far outweigh the cons and it is the main idea of the article .
The first thing you need to start with is a deadline to get everything done by .
Writing the play : first , you may ask learners to invent profiles and to tell you about their characters ; second , learners can write the basic outline of the play or you can adapt a familiar story .
They you should take a decision of choosing roles : start by asking for volunteers ; and always ensure that everyone in the class has a role or something to do .
Students must learn their lines by heart .
The most effecnive way is to practise every lesson for ten minutes at the beginning and end .
You can give them the play with gaps to read through and finally get them to perform a number of times without a script .
Some learners will not want a spiaking part , you can even ask them to be promters .
Reasons for doing a play : learners will learn whole chunks of language in a clear context and they will learn not only their parts .
It gives learners the opportunity to demonstrate different their skills at the language classroom .
Also they can see how much language they can produse .
In a world of increasing environmental awareness improved public transport represents the way of the future .
Although people do enjoy the convenience and privacy of travelling in their own private vehicles , in my opinion they may choose public transport if it fulfils certain conditions .
These conditions fall into three broad categories : attitudinal , financial and logistical .
From an attitudinal perspective , people must first be convinced of the benefits of public transportation .
An educational or public relations campaign must be launched to sensitize those who might have disregarded this possibility before .
People should be familiarized with the environmental , social and personal benefits for present and future generations .
This is one step .
From a financial perspective , public transportation must be a clear and viable benefit to consumers .
In other words , it must be more affordable than driving to work every day .
For example , if people know that by using bus and subway , they can save enough money to take a free holiday each year , many more individuals would be persuaded to travel in this way .
This is another critical step .
From a logistical perspective , public transportation should be convenient for commuters .
City planners and transport officials must ensure that frequent and reliable public transportation is available for each citizen .
For people to make the habit of travelling by bus or subway , they must know that they will be able to get to various places on time .
Transport vehicles must be well maintained , subway and bus drivers should be customer - oriented and service must be punctual and efficient .
This is an additional important step .
In conclusion , through a multi - pronged approach , it is possible to increase the use of public transportation .
City officials and politicians can lead the way by utilizing these forms of transport themselves and bringing about change through personal example .
Then , more citizens will follow suit and we may all hope to live in a cleaner , less polluted environment .

My favorite sport is cycling .
I enjoy this sport because it allows you to take care of your health by using almost all your muscles while you can also enjoy the scenery and visit the places you come across .
Like every sport , it is also a good way to meet people and make some new friends .
You can ride at your own pace and go increasingly far .
It makes you see the road and your environment differently .
Furthermore , it is better for the planet to ride a bike instead of a car because cycling does n't produce any pollution .
When you start riding a bicycle , you first need to check if your bike follows the security instructions .
For instance , you need good brakes , lights , a bell and reflective stripes on your wheels or reflectors .
You also need to know some basic rules such as putting out your arm to indicate when you turn and of course , you need to know the highway code .
A lot of people are afraid to ride a bike in cities because they fear the massive presence of cars and think they will be crushed .
Indeed , some places still need to improve the structures for bikes : sometimes they do n't have a lot of bicycle paths .
But if you learn how to obtrude in the circulation while remaining polite with the others , there is no reason to be afraid .
Let 's get on our bikes and discover new places !
Dear Paul ,
How are things ? I get your message last week .
Unfortunately , I did n't have time to answer .
I was studying a lot and now I 've got some days to rest .
You wrote that you are interested to know something about the concert I helped organize .
It was a great experience .
First of all , I met many people from all over the world . I keep in touch with them all the time .
during the concert I was responsible for checking tickets .
I was working with two people and we were to check two thousand tickets !
After the concert we had to clear the concert area as there was a lot of mess around !
We were cleaning over 8 hours !
On top of that , each of us got two tickets for the next concert of the band .
It was fantastic to take a part in that enterprise .
Take care , hope to hear from you soon

I was alone in my bedroom and a young good looking woman entered the room .
She swiftly came beside my bed and gave me a letter .
It looked quite simple , I had no idea who could have sent me that letter .
When the woman left , I opened it eagerly and when I read the first sentence my heart stopped .
It was from the most dangerous and terrifyng gang of the village .
It said that I was now one of them .
I met those boys next Friday and they told me that I had to pass the test initiation .
I felt extremely nervous , I was about to commit a crime and my heart was beating uncontrollably , really fast .
I went into the tiny shop and the shop keeper looked through me .
" Hi " , he groaned drumming his fingers .
" Do you have ice - creams ? " I asked nervously .
The shop keeper nodded and pointed at a grey fridge at the end of the shop .
" Thank you " , I mumbled and went straight to the fridge .
My hands were sweating and the other boys were waiting outside ecstatic .
A second later a child entered the shop and began to move around quickly .
He was quite small , about seven years old and he was beaming , smiling from ear to ear .
I thought it was the perfect moment and at the speed of light I put a whole box of sweets into my old bag .
Silence .
I walked forwards and stared at the shop keeper .
I was going to leave when the bitter and loud voice of the man surprised me .
" Hey little boy , what are you doing ?
He yelled angrily .
My heart nearly stopped beating . I turned and noticed that the man was not speaking to me , but to the child .
" I do n't know " , he answered confused .
" Where has the sweet box gone little thief ?
He rasped and crossed his arms .
" I have not taken anything yet " , the boy whimpered .
" Dear me ! How can you be so cheeky ? " he uttered dismissively taping his feet .
The boy began to mourn .
After watching this , I returned to my house hoping the man forgives the child .
Feeling horribly guilty , I fell asleep .
That was the first crime I comited and here I am now , in jail .
A day at the races .
This text lead us into the ( for me unknown ) world of horse racing .
In a few sentences we can get an idea of what it is .
And we can find different reasons to be interested in this type of events .
I think that horse races are a fun entertainment if you like one of these three things : animals , betting and fashion .
If you like animals you 'll ejoy seeing that beautiful horses running and vaulting as fast as they can .
If you like to bet and you 're not used to doing at horse races , maybe you 're looking forward to trying to bet on the nose or each way .
And if you love fashion and you have the chance to go to Ascot , you may run into the Queen and greet her , and at the same time enjoy the fabulous view of all those extravagant hats the ladies wear .
Meanwhile you can have a good time drinking some bubbly .
But you can also have a " horrible " day at the races : if you 're not savvy enough to know the differences between the bets , you can end up skint , penniless .
And of course , if you 're not an it - girl , you can spend a lot of money and choose a wrong dress to attend Ascot and perhaps you 'll have to view the races from behind a curtain .
Anyway , if you knew beforehand your odds of winning it would n't be so thrilling .
That 's the raison d'être of horse racing : lose or win money .
And if you want to admire the wonderful world of hats , you 'd better buy some magazine where you 'll find all the photos for just 2 €
Hello ,
thanks for the letter which has just arrived . I 've read that you 're writing a term paper on the chances of developing counties to profit from the electronic revolution , are you ?
I think I 've some useful information for you .
Because two days ago I 've read an article , by Nadine Bös , about this topic .
The text was about the possibility to transfer money with mobile phones in developing countries .
At first you have to know that the technical term for this is " mobile banking " .
Today it is fact that there is a target group for mobile banking : people who are living in remote areas of the world .
On the one hand there are hardly any banks in these regions , so they do n't have access to bank services .
But on the other hand the number of mobile phones has risen .
So now the most important factor is that mobile nets are reaching the remotest areas in the world .
Through this many people would have access to mobile banking and in addition to that it makes money available so it can be used in shops .
According to Hannah Dideck the largest potential is that migrants con use mobile banking to send money home .
I hope I could help you with this information .
Write back soon and let me know how it goes .
Best wishes
Alexandra
For today 's teenagers it is hard to imagine life before mobile phones although it did exist only some decades ago .
Few technical inventions have had such a deep impact on our daily life as this little thing .
However , there are various advantages and disadvantages to a mobile phone and everyone has to decide for him- or herself in which way to use this medium .
First of all , the mobile phone is a great way to " stay connected " all the time . Chatting with your friends , staying informed of the latest news , ordering online , etc - you can do all these things simultaneously , wherever and whenever you want .
This aspect has also enabled employees to become homeworkers as they do not longer need to be present in an office to get a job done .
Furthermore mobile phones allow last - minute - changes very easily .
No need to make a fixed appointment with a friend in advance , as you can always agree to call each other once everyone is on the way .
However , the biggest strength of the mobile phone is also the biggest risk in my opinion : being connected all the time creates a lot of stress for people , as you are always available for everyone .
Therefore you do n't have any time to relax , which is essential , even from your leisure duties .
The same is valid for business life : if employees are available all the time , they take the worries of the daily business with them to their home which means a lot of stress .
Last but not least , the mobile phone enables worried parents or suspicious partners to track the child or the loved one nearly permanently .
This can be seen as loving worry about someone but also as a sign of distrust .
Finally , the mobile phone offers both disadvantages and advantages in daily life .
However , I personally think that it should not be regarded too critically but should only be handled responsably , according to one 's personal needs .
I recently saw a film called Passengers .
It 's about 2000 people that want to go to a new planet to start a new life and their trip was going to take approximately 120 years .
Before the trip started , the company who decided to make this trip said that everything was perfectly calculated so that it was imposible to have any kind of problem with the spacecraft .
But they were wrong .
The first 30 years all was going good , but suddenly something bad happened .
One of the cabins broke down and the person who was inside it waked up .
These guy was called Mark and he was engineer .
Once he realized that he was the only person awake he knew something was wrong ..
He was going to be alone for the next 90 years .
He could n't continue like that so he hacked one of the cabins of a woman that he loved .
The first 2 years all was perfect until the day number 734 .
She discovered that she did n't have any problem with the cabin , it was Mark who hacked it .
Since then , they never spoke again .
It does not seem like years have passed since I first met her , but it was some time ago indeed .
It was such a hot summer that it was impossible to turn off the ventilator and I was a bored child with a laptop . I had signed in on the social network Tuenti and I liked passing all the time chatting .
One day , a girl called Irene talked to me .
She told me that she was bored as well and that she also had two brothers .
She was a very friendly person and soon we were chatting every day .
Although we were in the same school , we had n't talked before .
It was nearly August when we decided to meet .
I was really excited .
Irene was taller than me , brown - eyed and dark - haired .
She picked me up to her house .
And what a beautiful house it was !
She had a swimming pool , a little garden and a lovely bunny called " Suki " .
We stayed there all the afternoon , talking and laughing like we had been friends for ages .
I knew it was the beginning of a great friendship .
That one meeting made it a day I will never forget .
Louis was convinced that this new project will be an incredible opportunity for him to try new things and study different fields , which he enjoyed , he loved to read about science , inventions , and stay up to date with the news .
But he immediately thought - why not continue doing what I love while I do something new?-
That 's exactly what he began doing .
He send an e - mail to the tour company explaining his situation and sudden interest in this project .
The company immediately replied telling him that they were sorry if they did n't reply days earlier , but they could n't since the system crashed and did n't allow them to send electronic mail , just to receive .
They told that it was alright if he was interested in other projects , but he still needed to give the same working performance .
They asked him about this project and what was his idea .
Louis told them that it was related to an instrument to explore new places .
He did trust the company , but not that much for them to know everything he thought .
The company told Louis that they did n't want to bother him , but that they were interested in investing in this kind of projects , because it was related to the purpose of the company : exploring .
But Louis knew that the invention needed to have a great design that implemented portability , that is why he needed to refine his ideas for this project to be used in an immense type of useful ways .
The company told Louis that they wanted to compromise in this project and help Louis .
Later , that same day , Louis went cave diving in the mainland .
He wanted to conquest as much territory down the sea level as he could .
He thought that it was a great way to relax and think about things .
He loved the idea to descend to the bottom of the sea where his ideas would n't be taken away or heard .
When he was exploring the bottom of the sea he tried to grab a rock , but just when he touched it scattered into dust , which vanished in the bulk quantity of water around him , that 's when he knew the next important thing that the invention needed to have : resistance .
There 's a lot of pressure in the deep parts of the sea and what happened to the rock was the clear proof of it .
Although it also needed to be flexible it needed to be tough .
It needed to be this way .
If not , the consumers of this product will end buried .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to outline actions taken by the authorities of Mińsk Mazowiecki in the sphere of preserving the environment .
What happens to the rubbish
The local government of Mińsk Mazowiecki has recently implemented new laws which concern rubbish segregation .
It is obligatory for the inhabitants to put their different types of garbage into separate bins .
Although citizens usually obey those rules , in some cases they are completely neglected .
However , people who have bigger houses tend to compost the organic waste and that makes up for the disobedient .
The situation with household litter looks much better rather than what happens on the streets of the city .
Waste is thrown on the ground and very few people are concerned about this problem .
Town 's actions
As not all inhabitants are sensitive about the environment , it is the local government 's responsibility to decrease the harmful effects of people 's actions .
Authorities make sure that rubbish bins are placed in small distances since this is the most common reason why people throw litter on the ground .
There are many workers employed so that the waste is picked up .
Not also does it give job to people , but also has a good impact on the town 's scenery .
One of the most challenging issues in modern cities is transportation .
Cities have been planned to satisfy people 's needs to travel all around the city .
Now we can observe people moving around the city using bikes , underground , public transport , and cars .
Although there are many people who suggest that public transport is no longer a suitable option because cars are considered a more convenient option to transport , there are more benefits using public transport than travelling by car , such as reduction of traffic , saving money , and decreasing of pollution .
Firstly , a car could carry only 5 people at a time .
A bus or an underground wagon can carry from 30 to 100 people at a time .
When referring to cars , we can considerably reduce the number of vehicles on the streets if we use public transport .
The less we use cars , the less traffic we shall see in the roads .
Secondly , having a car implies different costs to be afforded .
For example , cars require petrol to function .
If a person constantly uses his / her car , he / she shall need to pay for more petrol .
Equally important , a car requires maintenance and it shall be another expense that the owner has to cover .
Finally , if every person drives his / her own car , pollution shall considerably increase affecting air conditions .
I was getting really bored .
I had to stand because we were shifting our house and had just sold almost all of our furniture on OLX .
The floor was very dirty and I could not even go out because all the people who wanted to buy our furniture were standing near our door .
My mother said that it would be rude to go at that time .
I was so annoyed that I closed my eyes and wished for a chair ...
When I opened my eyes I saw a beautiful chair with orange and green stripes .
It had four red wooden legs and it looked very comfortable indeed .
I immediately sat down and began to feel relaxed .
Suddenly the chair jerked up and went straight out of the window while I was still sitting on it .
It swerved beautifully avoiding a tree and landed on the ground as softly as a butterfly .
Then I realized that the chair had wheels along with a ' nitro & teleport ' button on the armrest .
I might have pressed the nitro button by mistake when I sat down .
I pressed teleport and said , " Botanical garden " .
It actually took me there !
I had a great time taking a stroll there while people watched me with their eyebrows raised .
I wanted to explore more about the chair but I knew that I should go home by them .
So I pressed teleport and said , " Home " .
That 's where it took me .
As soon as I reached there the chair disappeared and I landed on the floor with a thump !
My mother came and said , " Get up !
The floor is so dirty " and she went .
I guess it is back to normal now so I will have to get up again .
I leaned against the wall and thought about my adventure .
Today we had a class discussion about taking one year off between leaving school and starting university .
Different thoughts came up , but my personal opinion is that it could be a wonderful thing .
Taking a year off might help people who are uncertain about what to do next to make up their minds , while trying new things and making new experiences that will be useful later on their lives .
It would certainly be counterproductive and a waste of time if the time would be spent doing nothing and just passing the time like it were a long vacation , but if it is used to make new experiences , a year off can change the future of a person .
It can be a great opportunity to travel , meet new cultures and people , or it can be a chance to work to save up money for being able to afford the cost of the university planned on attending .
Or maybe during the year off somebody could also decide that they do n't want to continue their studies , because they already found what they want to do or be .
Personally , I would love to take one year off , and I think I would spend it travelling around Europe .
Sale promotion , which is the set of marketing activities undertaken to boost sales of the product or service , has become a vital tool for marketing and its importance has been increasing significantly over the years .
In spite of some controversies , sales promotion has already demonstrated a mass of positive impact on both sellers and buyers .
The aim of this presentation will be to analyse the aims and approaches of sales promotion as well as to evaluate both benefits and drawbacks sales promotions provide .
For this purpose , the presentation will be divided into four sections .
The first section will show the definition of sales promotion as an introduction .
The second part will provide the aim of sales promotion as well as the analysis of some key sales promotion techniques in detail .
Then the presentation will focus on a specific case study------the utilization of Flybuys loyal reward program .
Finally , there will be an evaluation of its advantages and disadvantages as well as the present situation .

With any new course , there are some certain expectations one will have .
At the beginning of this course , as a first year postgraduate student , I was ambitious for creating a new mechanical product or at least part of it at the end of this course by applying knowledge and skills that are provided throughout the course .
Eight months working in the industry as an assistant mechanical design engineer gave me the very basic concept of mechanical design .
Before taking part in this course , my concept about mechanical design was about applying either self knowledge or working as a part of a team to design mechanical products that are easy to be manufactured , durable and financial reliable .
My thoughts about mechanical design were somewhat match with the information that is provided in the first three weeks .
By attending the first three lectures , I soon realized that my general concept about mechanical design is quite simple as my thoughts about mechanical design is purely just creating new products .
I recognized that mechanical design is not just about creating mechanical products .
It can be seen in many aspects ranging from producing a maintenance process , improving performance for a specific part of the mechanical system to creating the whole new product .
This is because despite having experience in industrial design , I was never taking part in the design process from the initial stage .
Therefore , my knowledge about mechanical design is rather limited .
Being placed in a project team working for Sydney Water about producing a maintenance excellent standard , I started to read the course outline and lecture notes more carefully to find out where to start and what I should do to deliver a good outcome .
The first thing I have noticed is the importance of clarifying all the requirements with the clients .
This was demonstrated during the Project Introductions session as well as lecture notes , client interview task and client feedback ( which is worth 25 points in the total mark ) .
As soon as I met my group , I discovered how far behind I am in terms of using English to demonstrate the ideas and lure the attention from other group members .
However , this also is an opportunity to meet up and work with them every week , whose English is their first language , to improve my oral communication skills and persuasion .
Because in order to deliver a successful industry project , I not only have to make a good product , but also have to be good at introducing my idea and persuading customers .
The final consideration is the self - calibration , which also is the point that I have never considered before in a design process .
This is such an essential activity that allows me to gauge my performance , keep pace with the group and not to be left behind .
To sum up , at the end of week three , my expectation for this course are to be able to apply my reflective thinking in any further design process , to be able to deliver a persuasive technical presentation , to be effective in verbal communication skills and presentation skill .
Last but not least , I hope I can learn to work effectively under any circumstances as a team member or a team leader by the end of this course .

In today 's world , due to the fact the great comfort of cars , public transport is likely to disappear .
Firstly , is it true that cars are the faster way of transport .
After all , there are many people who ca n't afford a car .
In addition the car is one of the means most used not only its quickness but also because the cost of public transport is increasing every year .
From my point of view , many people use cars owe to the awful quality of some buses , trains …
We should also consider the fact that nowadays life is so busy that we ca n't waste our time taking public transport .
However , cars can cause some problems like traffic jams and accidents that could be avoided using public transport .
To conclude , it seems to me that it is fine to use cars sometimes but whether the quality of public transport was better , the amount of pollution and accidents would decrease .
In recent years , many regions of the world have faced an issue about water scarcity that may affect their development , especially for those countries undergoing poverty .
Due to the increasing population of the world , countries are likely to need more fresh water to irrigate crops to satisfy their population .
Therefore , water scarcity may pose a threat to people 's living standards .
This essay will analyse the problem of water scarcity in Australia and recommend some viable alleviation solutions .
It will examine responses including the recycling water , the development of technology about purifying ocean water and multinational sharing about water resources .
Recycling wastewater is an effective method to solve water scarcity problem .
This is because there is a huge number of water usage presenting in people 's daily life , they just need to be collected to filter waste parts .
However , the use of recycled water for daily routine is less common , because many people are repelled by the thought of water that comes from our toilets or drains .
For example , those recycled water can be utilized to water plants in a garden , but if they are clear enough , residents only need to heat them to wash dishes or even drink .
Thus , states should make it possible to purify the wastewater to an enough safety level .
Moreover , developing latest technology about purifying ocean water can be regarded as a viable alleviation strategy .
As is well known , about 70 per cent surface of earth is covered by ocean water , so every region surrounded by ocean like Australia makes the most of ocean water resource to release the pressure of fresh water need .
Although , governments are likely to face economic stress initially , which means they have to invest more money into upgrade technology instead of other field such as education , infrastructure and medical care , this strategy could affect dwellers ' physical health and promote their living standard .
Sharing different water resources with neighbouring countries can be another strategy which can help to alleviate the problem of water scarcity .
Countries with abundant resources can give assistance to nations with water scarcity .
In this way , those states of drought regions will obtain enough time and technical aid to overcome water problems .
Despite over shared water resources could lead to violence and even international tension , few countries suffered these problems .
In conclusion , water shortage has presented a challenge to individual life and global environment .
This essay has discussed three alleviation strategies with the potential to resolve the problem of water scarcity , including the use of recycled water and ocean water and international aid .
While these approaches are likely to solve the problem partially , they might have a positive impact on water shortage in a long term .
YOUR FAVOURITE SPORT !
You may not have never thought about it but you ///would///could///might/// be able to jump from a plane if you wanted .
If you ask me why I enjoy my favourite sport so much , I would n't hesitateto answer .
Skydiving is great !
First of all , the best thing about skydiving is the excitement and the discharge of adrenalin .
Additionally , you imagine just the moment before the jump .
When you are sitting on the plane next to your instructor , with your legs hunging and your arms crossed … It makes an indescribable impression on you .
Finally , you are around 4000 meters high and after 60 seconds of free fall at 200 km / hour , your parachute is opened and you are flying about 5 minutes until you land on the floor .
As you can imagine , there are some advices that you should do///know if you want to take it up .
I 'm sure you will agree that it can be one of your best experiences if you pay attention to your instructor all the time .
Plus , you should wear a sweater or jacket to avoid to be cold /// being cold because you are flying on the sky , over the clouds .
And obviously , you should n't be afraid of hights to enjoy skydiving fully .
I ca n't describe it , you have to do it !
Nowadays we watch the perfection of actors all over the world .
The range of techniques they use to strike the audience is colossal .
Facial expression is said to be more important for the film actors , whereas body language and voice intonation are paid more attention to in the stage acting .
Besides , camera work , props and special effects deserve to be called silver screen features , while staging implies actors to convey their play through body movements and energy .
It is evidently that those types of acting are different and the actors should adapt to the conditions they work in in one way or another .
But let 's take a closer look at what performance capabilities they have and might use during the acting .
The stage actor is armed with props , costumes and light as well as the film actor .
The only preponderance of film acting versus stage acting is in camera / editing work and special effects .
But those are justified by the presence effect stage actors might render active in comparison to film actors .
So I would say those types of acting are even in the sense of external factors .
Regarding acting techniques , stage actors do use their body languages as much as film actors .
The only thing that differs is that film actor has several takes opposed to stage actor who has to play perfectly at one dash .
And controlling your voice is also important for the film actors , in spite of having the support of audio operators , they still have to deal with the same problems as stage actors that is keeping your voice expressions in compliance with the acting , resonate moving , communicate emotions and feelings of their model character .
The key point is that the whole range of techniques makes that acting pieces perfect .
I would say , it does n't matter are you performing on the stage or in front of the camera , you should use your facial expression , body language , intonation and timber of voice as if you 're acting as your main character , embody all their treats and features appropriately to the situation .
In other words , no matter what kind of performance it is , the only thing that matters is using all your abilities to model yourself on your hero , get the feel of their role .
I live in Moscow , the capital of the Russian Federation .
There are different types of public transport that people use in major cities in my country , including Moscow : bus , train , tram and metro .
Furthermore people actively use private transport such as cars , motorbikes , scooters and bicycles .
Tourists can encounter with difficulties such as a traffic jam .
Sometimes it is very difficult to come home in rush hour because of traffic jams .
Banning cars from the centre of the city solves all these problems .
There are some disadvantages of banning cars .
For example , it is difficult for some people , including the aged and invalids , to use public transport .
I suppose that banning cars from the centres would be a big problem for them .
This idea also would be unpopular because it limits a freedom of choice .
Some people believe that cars should be banned from the centres of all major cities but I am against this idea .
In my view the best solution to all problems would be limitation of private transport in the centre but not absolute banning .
Recently I read two articles , they were called ' predicting dyslexia - even before children learn to read ( Zimmerman , 2014 ) ' and ' Innovative ' Intervention helps babies at high risk of autism ( Geggel & Writer , 2015 ) ' .
However the first article was more motivating to read , because the author substantiated important suggestions .
All I can say about the second article is that it has rarely proof of the intervention .
Firstly , the article ' predicting dyslexia - even before children learn to read ' shows a new research , in which it 's possible to pick up some of the signs of dyslexia in the brain even before kids learn how to read .
In addition , using this identification may assist parents , educators and clinicians to tackle the learning disorder .
Most importantly , this early intervention can help many kids with dyslexia to overcome their educational failure .
Secondly , the article ' ' Innovative ' Intervention Helps Babies at High Risk of Autism ' is based on a video - therapy , which improves the interaction between parents and autism - related babies in a way that would help develop the children 's communication abilities and social engagement .
In my opinion , the findings need to be replicated in larger studies before other people turn to video - based therapy as a potential treatment .
What I can tell from this text is that the research is an innovative idea , but needs more attention to improve their success .
All in all , if you want to read about an effective research with very strong proposals , I recommend reading ' predicting dyslexia - even before children learn to read ' .
It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
Tom has joined a volunteering team at St. Michael 's Hospital and this was his first day .
He was assigned to a task in the rehabilitation center .
He will deal with temporarily disabled people who come for a rehabilitation session every other day .
Tom 's role was to conduct a focus group once per week to explore the people 's experience and perception about their illness and the service given to them at the rehabilitation center .
The ultimate aim is to get a feedback for service - improvement purpose .
Tom has prepared a set of questions to ask .
He started with a group of six who signed a consent to participate in the focus group .
He helped them after they finished their session and took them to the meeting room .
He then introduced himself and made a clear statement about the objective of the focus group and assured them that their identity will not be revealed .
He started with some jokes so that they would feel at ease and disclose their experiences .
In the afternoon , he analyzed the content and wrote a report with some recommendations for achieving patients ' satisfaction .
He felt he had done a great job trying to serve the disabled patients .
Brands - pay more for better quality ?
We all know the situation , when we are in supermarket standing in front of two products which are the same , but one of it costs much more than the other .
Here we have brand products and no name products .
Now the question is , if it is really justified that brand products are much more expensive than no name products .
Most people associate brand products automatically with higher quality or better taste , while they think no name products are just cheap and without any quality and a bad taste .
In surveys , it was asked if consumers would rather buy brand products or no name products .
Most of the consumers said , they would buy brand products .
When they were asked why , they answered with " because it tastes better " .
After that the consumers made a blind taste test .
The product without brand tasted better to nearly everybody .
As a result you can say it is not always justified that brand products are more expensive than comparable other ones .
Only the brand and the good marketing makes it that expensive , not better quality or better taste .
The effect of media on people is clearly noticeable here .
A product which everybody is talking about and which is advertised a lot is automatically considered to be good .
It is like " Everybody has it , I need it too ! "
In some cases it may be true that brand products are better than no names , for example technology products , but products like Red Bull or others like that , are definitely not always better .
Brand and good quality are not always the same .
Here it is said , try and find out which is really the better one and do not trust on advertisements .
My wife and I got a nasty surprise when we were checking in at Vigo airport yesterday with our baby Pedro .
We had won three free plane tickets to Rome in a competition , and we were looking forward to our trip for months .
But , unfortunately , we had forgotten to get a passport for our son , so Pedro could n't fly .
Luckily , we had arrived very early for our flight , so we still had time to do something about it .
We ran to the police station in the airport to apply for an emergency passport .
My wife went with Pedro to the photo machine while I was filling in the forms .
The passport was ready in an hour , so we were hurrying to the gate and got on the plane .
Hi !
First of all , I 'm really happy you accepted my invitation .
You do n't have to worry about getting to my house , because it 's really simple , and I 'm helping you making it even more simple by picking you up at the train station of my town .
You 'll need to take the underground from the airport to the central train station .
The underground it 's in the airport and it 's very easy to reach because you just have to follow the signs .
You have to take the trains going towards the centre of the town and when you are on the train , jump off at the stop called " Stazione Centrale " .
Once you 're in the train station , go where they sell tickets and buy one for Viterbo .
Get the train and jump off at the " Viterbo " stop - I will be right out of the station waiting for you !
In this period it 's mostly sunny and warm , but in the evening it gets a little cold and windy so bring some jumpers or sweaters ...
I 'm looking forward to seeing you !
See you soon !
To do the same thing in the same place , people should do it in an organised manner .
That 's why I think that waiting in queues is essential at any place .
Otherwise , the place would turn into a mess , especially the crowded places .
It may seems boring and time wasting to wait in queues , but it is n't .
Actually , it is time saving because everyone eventually does what he wants without wasting time pushing other people .
In addition , employees do n't get confused by receiving several requests at the same time .
That saves time because they receive each request only once and in an organised manner .
Also , that make them do their jobs efficiently .
Also , some people would never do what they want without queues .
Old people and other weak people would n't be able to push and fight to get their turn .
That would make them feel disabled .
Being crowded in front of the employee makes people uncomfortable .
First , they would n't have privacy because there would be many people surrounding the one dealing with the employee .
In addition , everyone would feel rushed to finish what he is doing .
In conclusion , people will do what they want smoothly and politely , if they wait patiently in queues .
Hello ,
I 'm Sara and I 'm a half - italian , half - spanish , seventeen years old girl with a really cheerful , energetic and hardworking personality .
I saw this advertisement on a web site and I instantly thought it would be a really great experience for me to improve my English , but also a great way to show how responsible and caring I am .
I love children and it would n't be annoying for me to take care of a group of little monsters and organize sports and activities for them , actually I think I would really enjoy it and my day would end up with a tired smile , but a very bright smile .
I 've never had any experience of this kind before , but I have a brother three years younger than me and a little cousin who 's seven years old with whom I use to play a lot when I do n't have to study .
And , since it 's a summer camp and I do n't have homework to do , I would put all of myself into this job .
I 'm constantly brainstorming to find everything that could be challenging for me and I usually try to follow what my mind brings out , so I think I could come up with nice ideas for those children .
I started cooking when I was fourteen years old , but I 'm better at baking , so I could help preparing some sweets for children .
They would obviously be as healthy as possible and I would be really careful about those children who have allergies , and try to bake something that also them can eat .
I speak English quite fluently and I scored 95 points over 100 at both KET and PET certification .
English is also my favorite language since I was a child , I started studying it at the age of three with a really nice teacher named Helen and I continued improving my English watching American movies and TV shows during the past few years .
So , I hope to be a great candidate for this job and to get on board with you .
Best regards .
This year could be my last year ... on Gotland :)
Firstly I started a new job , it did not turn out they way I hoped unfortunately .
My colleauges are nice but the management are terrible and recently I just stopped talking to them .
Perhaps it is not their fault that this entire operation is so dysfuntional .
Maybe they are , like myself , a bit in over their heads .
But the whole experience brought a positive surprise : working at the same school as Nora does is actually pretty nice .
While we might talk about our job a bit too much I do n't think it is uncomfortable to work side by side .
Anyhow . I finally connected with some people .
I met some roleplayers at Wiscon and also some live roleplayers through Geek Network , of these the live roleplay looks promising .
It is a steampunk story and I am supposed to be part of a secret society that is trying to stop an evil cult .
It will be awesome !
Lastly I hope next year will bring some stability .
While I do not wish top continue to work and live like this , I am not sure I want to move again .
Moving is always upsetting and there is a period of adjustment that is very stressful .
And a new workplace is difficult to adjust to and there is no promise that it will be better than the last .
But I ca n't imagine in can be as bad or worse then my current job .
A thing I would miss is the connections I started forging with other people .
If I move again I know it would take another year to find other people at least .
Chances are that I wo n't meet any other people because Visby at least has a few nerds that you can hook up with .
I am not sure Vastervik has that kind of clientel .
So in conclusion I would like to say : the future is unknown .
May I not live in interesting times .
Michael had always been a good boy : responsible , quiet , always on time and always the first of his class .
But recently he had started to think that it was time to change .
The summer that year had been exceptionally warm , and Michael had found himself wondering if there were better ways to spend it than preparing for his University entrance test .
The truth was that he had n't rested since his graduation day and he was starting to feel tired , but he also knew that he could n't afford to fail .
He closed the window not to hear the laughs and yells of his friends , playing soccer in the field in front of his house : " I never liked soccer , anyway " he kept telling himself , but the more he tried , the harder it get to focus on his book .
He felt like a character in a cartoon , with an angel on a shoulder and a devil on the other , giving him opposite pieces of advice , and exactly like such a character , he did n't know who to listen to .
Suddenly the doorbell rang , distracting him from his inner struggles , and he heard his Mother opening the door .
" Michael " she called " your friend Tom is here looking for you , could you please come down ? "
He stood up , hesitating for a few seconds , then glanced at his book once again and finally got out of his room and said " Please mom , tell him I ca n't go out , I have to study . "
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
By a wide definition , teachers are the people who teach you .
For many people , parents are teachers in our life .
However , are parents the best teachers in our life ?
Some people might agree with this statement , but I do not .
I think the best teacher is a person who has professional knowledge and good teaching skills .
In addition , the best teachers , by their teachings , are the people who we most agree with and appreciate .
Many parents may not satisfy all of these conditions .
First of all , for many parents to have professional knowledge or good teaching skills is very difficult .
Most parents have special skills , but these skills may not be suitable for their children .
Compared with professional teachers , they have specific teaching abilities .
If parents want to get these abilities , they need to spend extra time to learn .
Most parents are not willing to do so because of limited time .
Good teaching skills are based on patience , training and passion .
However , not all parents have that kind of personality and most of them are confused or use the wrong ways to teach their children .
Parents undoubtedly play an important role in our life .
However , we may not be greatly influenced by their teachings , but by others ' teachings .
Because everyone has their own talents , values , and judgments , we learn more from those with whom we agree and appreciate and get significant influence from them .
These people can be deemed as the best teacher in our life , even if these people perhaps are not our parents .
Although parents teach a lot of things in our life , because they do n't have professional training and we may not agree with them and learn more from them , I think parents are not the best teachers in our life .
PREPARING THE REVOLUTION IN FRANCE
If I could travel back in time , undoubtedly I 'd choose to take part in the French revolution .
The reason for my choice is simple and clear : the French revolution was the turning point in the European modern history and , thanks to its achievements , people in the twenty - first century can enjoy civil rights such as freedom of speech , assembly , worship and , the most important one , freedom of thought .
It is difficult to think about Paris without its Eiffel tower ( it was built several years after the revolution ) , but I 'm sure it was a gorgeous city as it is nowadays .
I fancy its streets crowded by workers and peasants that have been called to support the revolution .
They meet at midnight to listen to the speechs of the leaders .
They trust in them , and are willing to fight for the freedom , fraternity and solidarity they proclaim .
I also imagine aristocrats fleeing Paris at their earliest convenience , leaving all their expensive dresses and impressive houses unattended .
They are frightened by the social movement , and prefer to look for a safer shelter in the countryside .
But , if I could be there , I would n't waste my time walking down the streets or laughing at the ridiculous aristocrats .
I 'd try to meet the poor king Louis the sixteenth and his wife , Marie Antoinette .
I would do my best for making their imprisonment less hard and , above all , I 'd try to convince the Parliament not to sentence them to the death penalty .
Because no revolution is worthier than a human life .

Subject : Concert in London
Dear Mark ,
How are you ? I hope you 're doing well .
Thank you very much again for helping me getting the tickets for the concert in London but unfortunately I have bad news for you today .
I was so excited about going to London and seeing you again .
But only until yesterday ! My professor told us that our final exam in this course would be on July 5th .
As you know I 'm not the best student and I 've already failed in this exam twice , so there is only one more chance and I have to take it this semester .
Otherwise I will be taken off the university register .
To be honest I got really mad at him because I really wanted to go to London and I also already got tickets for my flight .
You do n't know how ashamed I feel now , not only for you because you helped me to get the tickets ( and I can imagine how difficult it must have been ) but also because you have already arranged everything to make my stay in London as comfortable and enjoyable as possible .
Do you maybe have a friend who you would like to go with to the concert since we ca n't go together ?
I would let you the ticket so at least you have the chance to enjoy that event even if it is n't with me .
I 'm sure it will be lots of fun going there !
Otherwise I could sell both tickets and we can have a look if we want to go to the same concert here in Germany .
The band is not so well known here and the ticket sale hasn't started yet .
Sorry again for all those circumstances !
Best wishes ,
Claudia
I have been proving my abilities by overcoming arduous competitions since I chose this career as a lawyer and researcher complying with my passion in persuasion and problem solving .
In 2002 , I was ranked 11th amongst 930 candidates competing for 40 places at the University Federal of Paraiba .
Throughout my undergraduate studies , my professional skills were recognized at the internships at the Federal Court of Law and the most famous fiscal law office in the State .
At this period , I was the intern coordinator and I created a manual on the procedures employed by the entire Court .
At the law office , I supervised the ISO 8003 procedures .
On the other side , in recognition to my academic performance , I graduated with a Bachelor of Laws with Great Honors in 2007 .
I was placed in the top 10 with a GPA of 8.73 out of 10 .
My bachelor thesis , founded in Economic Law , was unanimously awarded by the Jury with the maximum score of 10 .
This first success as a researcher contributed to my interest in global regulation of trade , that conduces me to this LLM and the international business transactions domain .
Since my Law school graduation , many achievements encouraged my professional development .
First , upon graduation , I immediately joined a highly recognized firm , performing a double role of legal consultant and sub - manager , when I was only 22 years old .
On the same year , I succeeded the strenuous Brazilian Bar exam with a remarkable score of 9 out of 10 .
After almost 2 years working in complex litigation , I had acquired the maturity to pursue an international career to work within and cross - border contracts .
Therefore , in order to acquire the excellence extent demanded , I specialized in Economic law with a master 's degree at the University Paris 1 Panthéon - Sorbonne in 2009 .
Following my LLM graduation with magna cum laude in the top five , I enrolled in a PhD in International Economic Law at the University Paris 9 Dauphine in 2010 .
Due to my interest in law and economics , I developed a multidisciplinary research applying the economic analysis in contemplation of illustrating the mutual influence of rules and economic transactions on the legal certainty of transnational transactions .
I profoundly comprehend the theoretical ascertainment for this career , which is that international trade requires rational economic decisions with legally binding consequences .
Thereby , new regulatory sources are created in response to the globalized legal context .
In conclusion , as an international legal professional , I must be prepared for alternative methods of dispute resolution regarding cross - border transactions , giving the increasingly requirement to look beyond domestic law to find appropriate solutions .
Furthermore , I already profoundly understand the importance of linguistics in an international sphere due to my experience as a foreign lawyer and as a teacher .
Henceforth , I aim to consolidate my career by mastering the legal responses to the developments shaping international trade today .
The LLM in International Business Regulation , Litigation and Arbitration at New York University is irrefutably the postgraduate program that I need to ensure the outcome aimed .
Man has evolved over the years , since the invention of the wheel , to space craft expeditions .
Our specie has achieved great things , but despite all the great discoveries , there is still one problem we have not been able to suppress , a problem that has been haunting us since unmemorable times : racism .
In the 19th century , slavery had been eradicated from America , but soon another problem originated and took its place .
The movie " The Color Purple " displays a variety of situations from Afro - American people who suffered because of their skin color , known as racism , which can be defined as the prejudice or discrimination from one race to another .
In this period of time , the Caucasian race felt superior to the Afro - Americans , they had the control and they were in charge of the political and economic activity , while the Afro- Americans did the hard work ; as shown in the movie , most of the men where in charge of the crops .
They did not have a chance to receive any kind of education at all , it was absolutely forbidden , and that is why they could not aspire to more important jobs .
Afro - Americans were completely segregated , Caucasians found it impossible to live among them , that is the main reason why each race had their own church and their houses where separated to .
Afro - Americans were afraid of raising their voices to express their inconformity against the oppression they were suffering , and to fight to obtain equality was not an option because any sign of rebellion was cruelly punished .
Moreover , women in the Afro - American society where threatened in the most denigrating ways , men were the undisputed authority in the house .
Women were in charge of the household chores , some of them could get a job as a servant of a Caucasian family .
It makes me feel sad to realize that racism is still a problem from which society suffers . I wonder , Why do we have the necessity of feeling superior to other people ?
We are all equal to God 's eyes , and I believe we all have the same right of living a peaceful life based on mutual respect .
It had been a long and rainy day ; Tom had been working all day and was very tired and hungry .
He decided to go and have dinner at a restaurant which was very near his office .
He put his raincoat on , took his umbrella and headed to the street .
He walked briskly to the restaurant , and tried to be as happy as he could .
The restaurant was almost full .
As usual , he decided to sit on the bar and order some fish and chips .
The waiter , Anthony , knew him and they talked to each other about how their day had been , while he served him the usual beer .
Tom had a first drink and looked around the place .
He suddenly recognized someone , Molly .
Surprised he thought he had n't seen her for a long time .
Tom and Molly were classmates at secondary school .
She seemed to be having a drink with a friend at the bar .
She was calling the waiter , and unexpectedly saw Tom sitting at a table alone .
They both smiled at each other , and Tom went over to her to say hello .
It was an exciting encounter , and they were both very happy to see each other again .
As they talked they came to realize that they had been working at offices which were very near for almost a year .
They felt really happy together , and Molly asked Tom for a date .
It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
Public transport is more useful and better than travelling by car .
Many people would disagree , but our future depends on public transport .
First of all , our environment is polluted and if we are determined to save it we should definitely stop using cars .
Since cars produce exhaust fumes which slowly destroy our planet , we should start using public transport more often .
Although there are many other polluters , such as big industries , people should start with the easiest resolutions .
Although many countries do not offer a good public transport service , once people get rid of cars there will be more money for the improvements .
For instance , Copenhagen and Vienna are good examples for this .
It seems like cars are losing the battle in this case because these cities propagate the idea that riding bicycles can lead to better future .
As more money is being invested in the infrastructure , people tend to use more bikes and public transport .
Unfortunately , not many people are prepared to renounce all the advantages car provides .
For example , it is claimed that it is more convenient to travel by car than bus because you can make breaks whenever you want to and they are more spacious .
Moreover , it is faster to travel by car than by any other public transport - planes are an exception to this rule .
In conclusion , I think that public transport should win this battle .
It is a fight for the better and healthier future .
The aforementioned representative examples of Vienna and Copenhagen prove how easy it can be to remove cars from our lives , and I believe that more cities should follow their examples .
Dear college
About the task that you ask me to do , unfortunately I do n't have enough knowledge about LIMS yet .
I am just beginning to understand the way things are done here .
I understand that the new programme have some specific requisites related to preservation of analysed samples .
Nevertheless , all the information that I send to you is based on the information that my colleagues from wet chemistry laboratory and from microbiology laboratory gave to me .
Of course that if you have any suggestions please tell me .
I will transmit it to them and we will discuss them .
Suppose that we have a stock failure resulting from an increasing demand of a particular analysis .
Our international supplier wo n't be able to deliver the reagents or other goods on time .
But we have a local supplier that could do it .
Can we negotiate with them ?
What kind of deal can we do with local suppliers ?
I think it is important to have a local supplier that can help us in particular situations like a stock failure .
International suppliers take , at least a week to deliver an order .
Thank you for this conversation .
See you in a few days .
It was a cold winter night and the moon was fighting the clouds for freedom , much like any of us fighting through our life and it 's obstacles .
Michael however , made a living off his fights , at a young age Michael was attacked and mugged in the street so he started taking martial arts lessons lest he be bullied again .
With his shaking hands he popped the box of pills he was holding the whole time he was walking , walking towards his home , the place he always felt at ease in . "
The hell with it !
If the demolition crew camp in front of my place again tomorrow I 'll just show them the form ...
" he said taking a pill . "
But then again what good is a useless piece of paper ? " he panicked , putting the box on the night stand he did n't even understand the passing of time !
All was lost to dear Mike and he wandered the house anxiously .
Until he had calmed enough to go feed his dog , his one best friend , the dog he and his fiance ' bought before it broke off .
The Labrador really took him back to his engagement ...
Before the death of his dearest Mona .
He was doing well despite his sad life .
He fed on the frozen lasagna his mom had sent him a few days earlier .
He exercised and went for short jogs in between workouts .
His anxiety caught up to him every now and then but the good doctor had prescribed him a good remedy !
Lost in his thoughts and unaware of what was going on around him , he heated the plastic bag filled with leftover food for Baxter .
Suddenly Michael heard a thud from his upstairs bedroom , Called Baxter and took a bat with him upstairs .
Michael rushed to his bedroom with a fatal mixture of fear and adrenaline in his system , only to see his box of pills on the ground and the sound of muffed but heavy breathing coming from behind the door .
Michael closed the door , saw his dog gasping for air and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
It is well accepted that whenever you become a famous person you lose your privacy .
But does this mean that the whole of your life becomes public ?
Whether they like it or not , right from the beginning all you do becomes attractive for the mob : what you eat , where you go , who you date to , your possible marriage , your holidays , etc .
I agree with the fact that as soon as your life is not private anymore , famous people have to face journalists with a smile they do not have .
I mean by this that for sure there are some days in which these famous people are in a bit of a mood , they have to visit the doctor , or they have to solve mishaps with lawyers , and they have stuck those journalist following till the door or awaiting them stationed in front of their houses .
In these cases , jounalists themselves should realize that they are taking it too far and that they should respect them a bit more .
The map shows changes that have taken place in the town of Eastminster since 1999 .
During this period , the town has seen extensive growth in residential areas and local amenities , and a modernisation of leisure faclilities .
Parks in the north - east and south - east have been reduced to make way for larger housing estates the one in the north dramatically increasing accommodation in Eastminister .
As well as woodland in the north - west being remodelled into an adventure park , a hotel and golf course have replaced a historic house and gardens in the centre of the town .
south of the river , an industrial area has been constructed next to the existing railway while residential streets have been converted into more modern apartment blocks .
With increasing housing has come a bigger hospital and more shopping facilities the existing shops being built on the site of the old school , with a new school opening on the north bank of the river .
Thanks for sharing !
I really enjoyed reading your blog about shadowing students .
I like the way you gave examples how you felt and how you would change your own lessons .
I live in the Netherlands and at our school it 's the same .
Our pupils have to sit for many hours a day , and they find it hard to sit still and to be silent .
I also think that a lesson went well if they did n't talk and did their work .
However , when I was reading your article I felt ashamed due to the fact that when every teacher teaches the way I do it is logical that our students ca n't be quiet and ca n't sit without making a move .
Moreover , when we as teachers have a study day , I get tired myself by sitting all day .
Your key takeaway # 3 was shocking for me , the feeling of being a nuisance is dreadful .
In my opinion I am very patient and willing to explain difficult topics over and over again .
I really hope my students feel the same , otherwise I have to change my attitude ! I get paid for being a teacher and ,
as I see it , it is my job to clarify and help my pupils to understand .
Your experience gave me food for thought especially when you wrote that our pupils are sitting passively and listening during approximately 90 per cent of their classes .
I am going to look at my lessons again to see if I can change those lessons and try to make my pupils active .
I teach at Basisberoeps level and I have already started to use some activities were they must use an Ipad and make pictures or short films .
For example , my pupils had to learn the difference between this and that and I let them make a short film about pointing at things in school saying : this door , that window , this is my teacher , that is a chair .
However , I find it difficult to use activities every lesson because they are time consuming .
Although the main reason that prevents me from using them are my colleagues .
I do n't see them doing activities , it looks as if they are just doing their lessons and want to use a book and that is it .
For instance , when I hear that another English teacher finished Unit 5 and I am still at Unit 4 I feel incompetently .
It gives me the feeling that most important of teaching is doing all the exercises in the book and getting all the work done .
Maybe you understand this discrepancy between activate pupils and the pressure of the school board for the best test results .
In other words , how can we convince school board and colleagues that it is better for pupils to learn in an active way ?
Maybe the only one she 'll ever have .
She was walikng around the city thinking about the job she just lost .
Yes , she should accept this proposition .
Everything was looking perfect and it was something she enjoyed ndoing before the accident took place .
Her mom would probably want her to start to live no matter what .
She felt butterflies in her stomach .
She slowly started to smile .
The sad music that was playing in her earphones made her feel even more confident .
She passed next to the bar where her boyfriend was getting high with some , unknown to her , boys .
She wanted to stop him .
She really did .
But then something gone wrong and she just walked away .
As he did when she was hurt .
He made her feel bad so why would she do n't do the same ?
He did n't realize that she was going to leave him for ever .
BUt it was okay .
He never deserved her .
She was a good person and he was an asshole .
She took the bus and went to the office .
The director was waiting for her .
And she was ready .
Ready to work .
Ready to live .
Michael knew he was fading away , ever consumed by a feeling of apathy .
He hardly knew who he was anymore .
The dark clouds above the sky , full of life , seemed to mock his little desire to live .
He could heard the thunders shouting with rage , a rage he wished he could feel again .
He stared at an object on the beside table , the object that could free him from this hell like existence .
Thinking about it relieved him , made him feel excited about the unknown , the unexpected , maybe all the questions ever asked , maybe , finally , they would be answered .
Could bliss we found in dead ?
Had he seen it all ?
Was it the best part life could offer ?
its own end ? .
A tear started running down his face as he looked at the clouds .
The door was wide open , inviting him to take the offer .
He leaned over and grabbed the object .
He placed a hook over the door , tied the object to it and standing on a chair put the object around his neck .
He looked at the clouds , they were still grey , and then for a moment , he saw a tinny fragment of a rainbow .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
The members of my family are my best friends
Family is any group of people closely related by blood .
This is easy word to understand , but it hides more than defination says .
Behind this word I see my brother , parents and grandparents and feel very warm feelings .
I think the most important things in the family are love and support .
All the people need these things and the best givers are family members because they give unconditionally .
My family members all the time expression their warm feelings with hugs , kisses and beautiful words .
For example my parents hug me every day .
My mother makes me breakfast every morning and my brother brings me cookies , when I have a bad mood .
These small thing gives me a lot .
Also they always support me no matter what I do or think .
The second important thing is that I can always count on my family .
Usual friends can often say " no " or let me down , but my family never does that .
They are always ready to help me , they never let me down .
The third very important thing is trust .
My family knows most of my secrets , they know my worries and joys , they know that I am thinking about things .
And I like to trust my thoughts and secrets to them , because I know that my family is loyal to me , and their mouths are closed .
To sum up , I can say that the members of my family are my best friends .
They fulfill all the functions that my friends has , and they fulfill them even better .
Nowadays , our environment is really affected by the great deal of progress that technology has made in the last century .
As a result , some sources of energy like nuclear power are used for our daily life .
But , is nuclear power good for us ?
Let 's begin by considering the arguments in favour .
Huge amounts of energy are generated by nuclear reactors .
Moreover , they only need a small quantity of fuel to be produced .
Fossil fuels are our most common energy source , even though , they produced a terrible effect on global warming on account of releasing gases into the atmosphere .
They wo n't last forever and this will increase the use of nuclear energy .
Just look at oil , nature takes millions of years to form it and we have almost ended it .
Let 's turn to the arguments against .
Nuclear power plants have a high risk of pollution in case of accident .
In addition , they produce nuclear waste which is a major problem for the environment and public health .
All things considered , I believe that renewable energy will be the most common energy in the future as it does n't damage global warming although it is expensive to afford .
No , it is not rational because according to the economic theory , you should spend your money on those goods which yield the maximum utility per dollar .
MUx / Px must equal MUy / Py .
If MUx / Px is less than MUy / Py , than it is the consumer 's duty to buy more of good Y. If MUy / Py is less than MUx / Px , than the consumer must use more of good X. When you work more , you can consume more , each additional unit yielding additional , marginal utility , so you continually increase the sum of your total utility .
Following the tradition of economic reasoning , more is better .
She may be right about that treadmill because there is a cycle in which consumption results from work which necessitates further consumption , but theory would indicate that this is a positive , self - perpetuating cycle because increased consumption yields increased utility , therefore maximizing utility .
The book says that the rule to follow is to vary consumption until the marginal utility for every dollar for one thing that you are consuming is the same as the marginal utility for every dollar for another thing that you are consuming .
Ms. Luhr 's dissatisfaction from her current status in our society must come from her failure to vary her consumption of a variety of material goods .
For goods , the marginal utility may start to be less than it was before after a while , and then we are advised to switch our buying to other goods .
Ms. Luhr needs to find the goods which work for her .
Then she would n't be talking about the negative aspects of work because it is work which allows her to consume and maximize her utility .
Her utils are at their highest the more she consumes .
In my view Ms. Luhr is succumbing to her emotions rather than her logic because everyone knows that increased work yields increased wealth and increased utility , and this is the ultimate goal of a rational person who is acting selfishly which is how economists think people act .
If Ms. Luhr were truly being selfish and self - interested , she would obtain greater satisfaction from greater consumption , but her statement is defying this tenet of rationality which is so important to economic reasoning .
She does n't want more .
She must be irrational .

Dear Mr. Smith ,
I saw the announcement of your school in the magazine " Speak up ! " and I 'm writing to have more details .
I work as accountant in a company in Milan , but I would like to have more opportunities and I think improving English is really important to be more competitive at work .
I 've been learning English for four years and my level is " upper intermediate " , but I think I lack confidence in speaking and I should be more natural .

In this way I would have the chance to spend my holidays in your enjoyable country and at the same time study .
I 'm a sociable person , so I would n't have any problem in a group , provided that there are n't Italians , because in that period I would n't like to talk in my mother tongue at all !
I 'm keen on cultural activities such as theatre or cinema .
I 'm not a really athletic person , but sometimes I enjoy playing volleyball or running .
I thank you in advance and I 'm looking forward to reading your proposal .
Kind regards .

Hans Feurer is a mainstay of fashion photography since the late 1960s .
The peak of his career was in the early 80-s , after the legendary Kenzo Takedo 's advertising campaign .
Feurer 's campaign for Kenzo was one of the most popular and it defined him as a successful photographer .
Hans Feurer was born in Switzerland in 1939 .
After studying art in Switzerland , he worked as a graphic designer , illustrator and artistic director in London .
Traces of his previous career are evident throughout his work in his careful compositions and precise styling .
In 1966 , Hans Feurer travelled to Africa , during which trip he decided to become a photographer .
He returned to London and began to compile a portfolio .
1967 Feurer 's career went up like a rocket .
At the same time he worked for the Pirelli calendar in 1974 he also featured shots that appeared in Elle , Vogue , Numero , etc .
More than 30 years ago , in the remote deserts of North America , Hans Feurer was given free to photograph Kenzo Takedo 's 1983 advertising campaign .
The career of a Somali - American fashion model Iman also began after this pioneering shooting .
These images became the subject of Feurer 's eponymos book , lavishly illustrated with 175 photographs , illustrating his five - decade long career .
The book includes Feurer 's photographs for the 1974 Pirelli calendar , for Kodak and for fashion magazines such as Vogue Italia , Elle France and Nova .
Weight lifting is involves the basic and most natural human movements .
Obviously the weight is the resistance , which will help the individual to gain strength and mass .
Every time I go to the gym I feel like I have to breaking my limits and replace them with the feeling of success .
Success makes me keep going .
The best advice I can give for a newbie is to do not go the gym at all without knowledge .
Every wrongly executed rep will take you closer to an injury .
Take your time and make a plan .
Look up on the Internet how to execute the exercises properly .
Eating healthy foods are the other part of that sport .
I rather call that a life style .
The two competition lifts in order are the snatch and the clean and jerk .
Each weightlifter receives three attempts in each , and the combined total of the highest two successful lifts determines the overall result within a bodyweight category .
Bodyweight categories are different for women and men .
A lifter who fails to complete at least one successful snatch and one successful clean and jerk also fails to total , and therefore receives an " incomplete " entry for the competition .
The clean and press was once a competition lift , but was discontinued due to difficulties in judging proper form .
Dickens and the Bronte sisters wrote in very different ways .
Dickens 's style is full of sentimental realism : he describes reality with a sentimental tone and he mixes comedy and pathos .
Conversely , the Bronte sisters are influenced by the preceding Romantic works , and their novels contain Gothic elements such as ghosts and the dark ominous atmosphere .
If their themes are considered , it is immediately clear that Dickens builds an extraordinary image of the Victorian society , with a wide range of characters and stories which reveal the conditions of children and the poor ; instead the Brontes ' novels contain the Byronic hero , a male figure with a dark past who wants to find some revenge , as Heatcliff in " Wuthering Heights " or forgiveness as Mr Rochester in " Jane Eyre " .
In contrast with Dickens , the Bronte sisters deal with love and psychologically complex women as protagonists .
PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS FOR OUR ENGLISH COURSE
The aim of this report is to inform the committee about the wishes of the students who took part in the survey that was conducted lst week in our school .
NEW FACILITIES
Generally speaking , our school is well equipped .
However , there are some defficiencies that could be fixed .
Firstly , there is a great demand among our students of a computer room with broadband Internet connection .
It is well known that this kind of facility help students make the most of their time while learning English .
Secondly , we are in need of a conference room .
This will be useful to practise both speaking and listening skills .
Finally , it is also recommended to update the books in the library : most of them are quite old and outdated .
ACCOMMODATION
One surprising outcome from the survey was that students do not feel comfortable enough in the residential building .
Not only the bedrooms are rather small , but also are they quite cold , because of the lack of a heating system .
This is a great problem during the winter : almost every student has suffered from illnesses during that time of the year .
There are also numerous complaints in regards to the quality of the food offered in the canteen .
It will be advisable to change the catering service .
CONCLUSION
We will be grateful if any of these problems were solved by the committee .
In case you need further information regarding any of these issues , please contact us and I will be glad to respond you as soon as possible .
Dear John
I 've read your letter and let me tell you that I 'm really sorry that things are not going well lately , especially because I know how much you enjoy sports and your music classes .
But let me tell you this , you 're an amazing person and I totally think that you can handle this and even more .
Maybe if you could just reduce the time you spend with each of your activities , it could work out and you would n't need to drop any of them .
Organization is the key .
However if you are still very stressed , then you might drop one of them , I certainly do n't know which one you should drop , I think I would drop the music lessons , because sports are good for your physical and mental health , and also help you to be fit and it 's more interesting for me ; but maybe a list with the pros and cons of sports and music lessons can help you .
Start asking yourself Which one do you like the most ?
Which one do you enjoy more ?
You should totally do the list and then when you finish it , you can send it back to me , and we can discuss it .
You know I 'm always here to support you and your decisions .
But tell me , what else has been going on with you ?
How 's school going ?
You did n't mention anything about your best mate this time , and you two guys always have a lot of stories to tell .
I hope you can talk about it in your next letter , I really have a blast with your stories .
Oh , and please give your mother a huge hug from me .
Yours sincerely
Dana
Environmental problems today are more worrisome , if we not do something for our planet , in a few years we will suffer the consequences .
No time to speculate , it is time to act and implement all these measure we know .
Enough talk , is time to make a decision : we want a better world , or , we want to see it destroyed in a few years .
We still have time .
Simple things like recycling garbage , walking short distances instead of using cars , not throwing garbage on the streets or oceans , can mean a considerable change , because if we add the small efforts of each of us , the results are translated into millions of people .
I recommend implementing a campaign called " No more blah blah blah , it 's time to save the world " , we may not have super powers and not be " Superman , Ironman , Captain America , Batman , etc . " and we save the planet from intergalactic threat but unlike them , all together we can save the planet from an even greater threat , its total destruction due to pollution and environmental problems that we ourselves have caused .
Just as we have the courage to provoke , we have to have the courage to do something to fix , let us become that super hero that changed the world and made a change for future generations to have a healthy environment to live .
Just think about your future and in your family , and when you see rubbish lying in the street , remember that you can become the superhero that someday be satisfied because he did something to save the planet .
It 's time to bring the superhero we have inside ; good luck !
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to suggest ways which will contribute to increasing the number of foreign learners in the school and to make recommendations for future improvements .
Town 's entertainment
Although my town is not an enormous industrial center , people are fascinated by the leisure activities provided here .
Variety of cafes and clubs would appeal to a great number of foreigners owing to the fast service and the proper attitude to clients .
They would also enjoy our museums and galleries which can bring them closer to our history and traditions .
New teaching approaches
More students would be attracted when the school government made some changes in the learning system .
I recommend that a more common teaching method should be one - to - one lessons , namely teacher with only one student , as that will contribute to increasing the range of their knowledge and will be also beneficial for students who need more help in a particular subject .
Array of facilities
Dissatisfaction with the school equipment is occasionally expressed by the students .
Therefore , it is needed to provide new facilities in the classrooms .
Computer - based learning would be a great idea of attracting more foreign students because that will maximize their technological capabilities , so that more work will be implemented .
Improvemnts on socialising opportunities
The school government should offer more extra - curricular activities , including organising excursions in the local area and giving students a chance to choose the school course which appeals to them the most .
Recommendations
I would recommend implementing all the suggestions listed above because these improvements will increase the number of foreign students making their accommodation in the town more pleasant .
Hi Katie ,
Thanks for writing !
It was lovely to hear from you .
How are you doing ?
I hope you are well .
You asked me for advice and I think I can help you .
Firstly , how much money would you like to spend ?
I know plenty of amazing English courses but they all have different prizes .
Have you thought about learning English on the internet ?
It might be a great idea because most of them are free .
I 've seen a couple of advertisements on English courses in our town , but they do n't seem very useful .
They might not be a good idea .
However , if you want to have a look at them , they are put up on the supermarket .
I 've got a cousin who works as an English teacher and she has an academy right next to the city council .
She gives classes from 8 o ' clock in the morning until 7 o ' clock in the evening .
You can choose the time and the days you will like to go and she has fantastic offers if you do not want to spend a huge amount of money .
I leave you her mobile phone in case you need it : 681234567 .
Write and tell me how you are getting on .
Hope to hear from you soon ,
Reyes
However much Roman law , Mosaic law , and rabbinical law impacted lives of Jews living in first - century Israel , many people who followed the religion of Israel lived outside of Palestine and beyond the borders of the Roman Empire .
Thus , many of these laws would not have played a big role in their lives .
At the same time , however , anyone professing to be a follower of the God of Israel would have adhered to the Ten Commandments .
The Ten Commandments provide Israel with the moral framework for maintaining it .
The metaphor is the Bible uses to express this relationship is covenant .
While the metaphor comes from the sphere of international law , it is wrong to understand the commandments merely as a summary of Israel 's obligations toward God . . .
.
Israel obedience to commandments was not a matter of submission to the divine will as much as it was a response to love
I always go to have a pizza in a restaurant near my house . "
La Terrazza " is the classic Neapolitan restaurant , that makes pizza and all the Neapolitan specialties , as all the type of fried .
It uses only fresh ingredients from naples that come there every day .
The pizza has a really soft base , a lot of tomato sauce and fresh leaves of basil .
The place remembers the atmosphere of the little alleyways of Naples , with pictures of the most famous Neapolitan people on the wall .
You can sit there and wait for your pizza while watching the football match or bring your pizza home .
The owner Patrizio , is really nice and you can often find him out of the restaurant talking to some guest .
I think it could be suitable for my class because it has two halls and one of them is always used for big groups of people , like us , the service is really rapid and in front of the restaurant there 's a beautiful square where we can have a drink while watching the typical Neapolitan evening .
Obviously everyone loves pizza , so it 's the perfect place .
Some experts say that public transportation is a crucial part of the solution to the developed nations ' economic , energy , and environmental challenges , helping to bring a better quality of life .
In increasing numbers , people are using public transportation and local communities are expanding public transport services .
Every segment of society - individuals , families , communities , and businesses - benefits from public transportation .
But , in fact , the car provides much better mobility needs , both in the big cities as on the countryside .
Many of us live in a hurry .
Our daily life is thoroughly planned , from the morning to the night .
We must keep doing our day - to - day concerns at work and at home , and , at the same time , keep holding our social life and entertainment activities .
Modern life orders our days and weeks in a packed schedulle of activities : job , children , housework , fun , free time ...
We have to go fast from one place to another , just to be in time for fulfilling next task or activity .
It 's for that we need to improve our mobility skills and private transport , as a car , allows us to achieve more efficiently our goals .
Public transport has its advantages : we can say that a lower cost , less pollution and more free time and rest for doing anything else during the trip could be public transport 's main positive points .
But , on the other hand , travelling by car gives us more comfort and saves time , and it offers a wider range of choices of departure and routes .
Every day the science and the industry are developing new materials , technologies and clean energy sources .
As industrial and technological development progresses , public transport will lose passengers and the use of private cars will spread anywhere around the world .
Lost for Words ?
Have you been studying English for years , but still ca n't say a word ?
Do you suddenly lose confidence when you have to speak to someone ?
I had the same problems , but I 've managed to find some ways to overcome them .
First of all , adopting a positive attitude is essential .
You should never be afraid of making a mistake or worry that people will laugh at you .
only then can you really start to speak .
Most people listen for the meaning of what you are trying to say , and do not notice your mistakes .
Secondly , you should try to get as much speaking practice as possible .
In class , answer as many questions as possible , and try to participate in class discussions .
When you are on holiday , try to make contact with other English - speakers , and who knows ?
You might make some good friends in this way .
My problem has always been vocabulary .
i find watching TV programmes in English and reading increase my exposure to new words , and help me recycle words I know in new contexts .
I hope that you will find my suggestions useful .
Do n't waste any more time !
Get speaking English now !
This is a very common argument : the true genius stands out so much that can not be misunderstood , so if he is not recognized then he is not a genius .
But this is faulty reasoning : it accept the idea that a genius is always recognized on the basis that in history geniuses have always been recognized - which is not true , or at least is not demonstrable .
They take for granted that historically geniuses have always been recognized , but in reality they are only talking about geniuses that , in fact , have been recognized .
They know nothing of those who have not been recognized and that may have been completely erased from history , and therefore can not be used as an opposite example .
To sum up , because the geniuses that we have decided to recognize as such have been recognized , they argue that all the geniuses are always recognized : pure self - referential nonsense .
In the 19th century for some , such as Cesare Lombroso , geniality resembles mental illness .
For Lombroso exceptional people are independent , away from the banality of life , isolated , impatient , asocial , often considered crazy .
The time in the university is the most important time in our lives because , we learn lot of things and it prepares us for our future career .
Some may think that it is better to have classes with discussion of professor and student .Others may disagree .
They prefer classes with lecture and almost no discussion .
In my opinion classes with discussion are better .
First , classes with discussion between professor and student had an advantage for the student because they learn how to interact with their fellow student .
Doubtlessly , such interactions with other people will help you to broaden your mind and learn new things .
This will enrich your personality .
For instance , a year back I was in north Texas university in USA , there was a health management and policy class with almost no lecture but with lot of time for open discussions .
In the beginning , I thought this was disadvantage but this was not true .
On one day we spoke about medical treatment cost in different country and one of my friend , Wole was from Nigeria .
Consequently , he was able to tell us how the cost of the treatment are less , how doctors are dedicated , and how everybody has access to primary health care .
As a result we all know what to be done so that we can make little changes in the reform to lessen the cost of the treatment .
As you can see , open discussion in the class are really important since they broaden your horizon and help you to understand different nation 's policies .
Second , open discussion in the class help you to develop certain skills in order to become an independent thinker and speaker .
It is evident that independent speaking and thinking skills are valuable for your career .
For instance , I was really afraid of speaking in front of many people .
However , this health management and policy class with open discussion was helpful for me insofar as I learned how to speak in front of others .
In order to get good grades we are forced to participate in discussion .
As a result I overcome my anxiety and started speaking in front of those students and I found its not difficult as I expected .
This experience taught me that it is better ti participate in a class with open discussion because it provide you with speaking and thinking abilities which are imperative for your career .
All in all though some may oppose my opinion , it is clear that classes with open discussion and almost no lecture are preferable because interaction with other student will broaden your mind and you become a better speaker and thinker .
That is why every university should offer such classes .

Dear Alex ,
I 've been waiting for your e - mail for two days !
I hope you 're ok , by the way .
Are you serious about the new activity center ?
It 's an excellent idea , of course we should go , I bet there are lots of things to do so we can have a great time .
Well , all your suggestions sound good to me , however , I would probably choose climbing because not only is it an extreme sport but it is also an exciting activity I would like to try .
Do you agree with me ?
If you prefer to do other things instead of this , please just tell me !
About Saturday evening , why do n't we just stay at home and watch some One Direction videos ?
They 're awesome !
I do n't know if my parents will be here on Friday , I 'm afraid not , they 've been working so much !
See you on Saturday .
Love ,
Diana
Tom woke up as a beam of sunlight slanted through a crack in the wall of the old cabin .
He stared at the clock hanging in the wall and frowned .
It was late , and there was a lot of work to do , so he 'd better catch up .
By the time he arrived at the rivershore , some of his colleagues were already digging the ditch .
The river was flowing down with great noise , and its level was slowly rising up , as it had been happening for the last few days .
The crops might be flooded very soon if they did n't do anything to avoid it .
Everybody was there : the Smiths , with their three broad - shouldered sons ; the Newtons , who even brought some of their stallions to help us remove the earth and the stones ; and the slim guy who lived in the farm in the northern hills of the valley and whose name nobody knew .
They worked all day long , restlessly , until they were breathless and their hands were bleeding .
Then , they worked a bit more .
Finally , Tom could hear Matthew shouting from the other side of the field .
They decided to stop until the next day , as the dig was almost finished .
He gazed at it , a bit worried about the possibility of more raining during the night , but proud of having put the farm in shelter .
It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
We human beings are highly socialized creature in the world .
Therefore , it is inevitable that we have to learn to be part of the society .
Parents , in some cases , are mentors to children .
However , considering the complexity of the society , I believe it better to learn in schools rather than from parents .
First of all , there is no denying that parents may teach their children enormous fundamental living skills , on which their progeny count .
Nevertheless , the skills are not diverse enough for children to deal with specific problems when living in a complex society .
For example , one of my senior high school 's classmate had encountered communication problem involved in the other 's family .
As a consequence , they never talk to each other since then .
Following the previous paragraph , there will always be people of different living styles , attitudes , and beliefs in every aspect of one 's life .
Have we not lived and learned the skills in a group , especially in school , we will not be skilled before entering the society .
The society as a whole is a place where both competition and cooperation take turn continuously influence every member .
If we only live in our original family , parents will probably forgive us when we make mistakes .
In contrast , living in a society is another story : people might blame , compete , or even hurt others no matter who you are .
Learning in schools , however , provides valuable opportunity for children to learn not only from teachers , but also from relationships between peers , and as a result , proves the way for being independent in the future .
In a nutshell , there is a great deal of knowledge needs to be gained for children in order to live in a society .
School , a place with diverse students along with their attitudes towards lives , might be better than learning merely with the parents .
The best sport in the world .
Have you ever tried unsuccessfully more than 5 sports in only one month ?
I have .
Although it 's true that I do n't actually love sports , once I found golf it totally engaged me !
By playing golf you can enjoy a wonderful journey in touch with the nature and even with some friends , while you do some healthy , constant and not too tiring exercise !
If you like the great views from a high hill , as well as having a relaxing time with yourself or sharing it with other people , golf is the perfect sport for you .
The only disadvantage I could find is that golf is n't such a cheap sport to do , as it requires a lot of expense and also a good mental and psychological health , which is the first thing I recommend to work on if you want to enjoy golf from the beginning .
However , as long as you can afford it and you 're provided with patience and enthusiasm , you should n't miss the opportunity to play this amazing sport .
I totally encourage you to try it at least once and I 'm sure you will desire to repeat !
Sometimes it seems to me that there is an ocean outside .
It slowly rustles and clatters and it 's pulsing waves attract so much that you ca n't stand sitting still much longer and you are ready to throw up everything and run towards it .
However , at the last moment , you understand that the ocean is there , in eternally beloved Spain .
Long before our journey I knew that I would love this country , I would fall in love with ocean and sea once for all .
I was wrong only about one thing : I had loved it long ago .
I had been adoring the sea and dreaming about it when I had never seen it before , never heard it before , but definitely felt it not by skin but my heart .
We spent ten days on the Atlantic seaboard , in a small town - Cádiz .
The main advantage of it is that the ocean is always near at hand , no matter in what part of the town you are .
Like in all the seaside towns , it 's always windy there .
The wind is often strong and cold , and it blows off hats and tousles the hair in such a way that it ca n't be combed any more .
So , that 's why I gave up the idea to do it and decided to be a shaggy - girl= )
Also I remember sweat perfume of Spaniards ( and Spain itself ) , spreading through the streets of old town and mixing with the smell of fried fish that is ready to be served in numerous bars , cafes and restaurants .
I remember the warmth of twilight wnich lures you to the heart of this town .
I remember the laugh of people , sitting at the tables and chatting .
I remember children , running about the small squares in fronf of the cathedrals ; elderly people in wheelchairs ...
All these memories are always with me , and to go through them again I do n't even need to close my eyes , everything in my mind heart is too vivid to forget .
Today I am writing about learning another language .
It could seem something very useful , with no drawbacks , but each coin has a head and a tail .
Learning another language is a wonderful way of learning about another country .
Check the languages you know and compare them to the people from those countries .
A language it is the capital thing to learn because it is the way people communicate and organize their thoughts .
Furthermore , it gives you the chance to enjoy the works done in that language .
That 's an incredible opportunity .
Nevertheless , when you are learning a language , it brings confussion .
You need to change the way you organize your thoughts in order to master it .
On the one hand the old one could be hard wired into your brain .
On the other hand , the new language needs an additional effort .
It also has another negative effect , you have limited time on this planet .
There are an incredible amount of things to learn .
Why would you waste your time learning a new language , when you probably do not know enough about your own .
In summary , learning a language is something beautiful , useful and entertaining .
It can be hard and it has its downsides .
But , as a learner of my third language , I am a firm believer it is the right choice .

Is change always good ?
Change is always good .
But sometimes the pace of change , the direction of change or the consequences of change can make it no good at all .
Life implies change .
No change , no life . Nature is life and death , construction and destruction .
No change , no Nature .
To stop the change is impossible That would be against Nature and against ourselves .
Every human action provokes a reaction .
Every single word causes a gesture , a thought , a change in the others .
Every step marks a footprint in the ground .
The smallest work changes the environment .
Any decision changes future .
Life is change .
But this change has a rhythm and it is better to respect it .
Life and change have also a direction , an aim : growth .
Everything that does n't grow is dead , and death is the opposite of life .
To inhibit the growth of a living being is a cruelty , but sometimes it happens .
Think of those Chinese women obliged to constrain their feet .
Think of the Olympic Champion Nadia Comaneci , artificially stopped in her physical development to preserve her graceful childish body .
Equally cruel , it is , in my opinion , to accelerate the pace of growth by forcing .children to work like adults or by inducing little girls to dress and behave as femmes fatales in video - clips or magazine covers .
Nature is also change , but in a cycling direction , and in a natural rhythm : the movement of celestial bodies , the rotation of Earth , the alternation of days and nights , the sequence of seasons … , in short , the wheel of life .
We lived in a time of accelerated changes .
Technology allows us to do and learn in one life 's time more things than our ancestors were able to in several generations .
But at the same time we are working against Nature - let 's think of pollution and climate change - and against our own human nature : distress , allergies , strokes and heart attacks are nowadays more and more frequent .
I think we should readjust the rhythm of change in order to be able to reinterpret , in a positive sense , Lampedusa words " everything must change so that everything can stay the same " .
Shopping is very important for people .
It helps to cope with stressful situations .
While shopping , you are doing what you like and enjoy .
But some people can get annoyed by this kind of activity . They may be irritated by loud music in the shopping areas , long queues at the cash desk and crowds of customers everywhere .
Some people can be called shopaholics , as they ca n't live without new clothes and furniture .
I do n't belong to any of these groups , because I am not addicted to shopping , but I do love the process of choosing clothes , shoes and accessories . I hate going shopping with my father as he is always advising stupid stuff .
However , I find shopping with my mother pleasant and easy , as we have the same interests and tastes .
She helps me to make the right choice and never looks at the prices .
Actually , this is a wrong idea , because I must not waste money on things that are not worth buying .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
My name is Alex Yegorov and I am writing to request information about qualification requirements for obtaining a skills assessment in order to submit my Expression of Interest in SkillSelect .
I would appreciate it if you could send me necessary applications forms and associated information relating to the assessment .
It would be appreciated if you could provide assessment procedures , timeframes and charges as well .
I graduated from the University with specialisation in Fiber - optic Transmission Systems .
However now I am working and planning to continue working as a Software Engineer ( 261313 ) .
Would Telecommunications Engineer ( 263311 ) be the right nominated occupation for me ?
Also may I have information on which version of the IELTS should I take , the Academic or the General Version ?
Yours faithfully ,

The European Union is created and meant to be an organization that helps all of its members to develop economically and socially while contributing to the common good of the whole union itself .
It works towards allowing all the EU citizens to travel and work freely no matter which country they are from .
Migration is a factor all countries must consider in order to move forward .
Everyone must be accepted and integrate in a specific society .
All current 27 nations must work both individually and together for the best conditions of immigrants .
There should be a working network for providing suitable jobs and standard of living to those , of course , who are looking to work and contribute to society , and do not simply expect to lay on the back of a more economically developed countries .
Many non - EU citizens live and work in Europe but for this to be successful they have to be able to integrate into their receiving society .
They should be able to enjoy the same rights and responsibilities as EU citizens .
Europe needs bright young people with an urge , with a wish to be productive , to create a better future for themselves and for their children .
Migration brings all the cultural wealth and diversity in Europe and integration is an expression of civic cohesion , contributing to political stability .
First priest to realize that church wine is not real blood .
" The taste of my blood was completely different from the Sacred Blood " .
In 2015 , after 30 years of service in the Church of the Sacred Heart in Peluzuchampa , north of Bolivia , the priest Inocencio Raudales , 66 years old , realized that the wine drunk at the moment of communion is not the truly blood of Jesus Christ , as he has thought for his whole life .
" I realized about this fact last December when I cut my finger while I was cooking and I sucked the blood that was flowing from the wound " .
Inocencio , surprised by this discovery , asked to his partners in the Order of Saint Bartolo about the taste of their blood , incredibly , after a needlestick in their fingers , all the priests from the congregation agreed that their blood did not taste like the wine converted in Holy blood at the church .
At that time , the Order sent to Vatican an urgent message and called the press for making the announcement of the discovery .
At this press conference Inocencio assured that next year he will try to prove if pigeons truly represent the Holy Spirit .
Hello , Alison !
I 'm glad to hear from you again ! I have to say that you should write in your work that the traditional Portuguese food is delicious !
What can I say ?
Usually my eating habits are similar to the most Portuguese ; I have my breakfast around 7.30 and 8.00 , I eat bread with cheese or jam and I drink a large glass of milk with cereals .
At lunch many people eat a lot ! I start with a small soup and then I have the main dish and the desert .
If I have some time before 14.00 , I love to have a coffee with friends - in Portugal everyone drinks an espresso !
In the afternoon I eat some cookies .
Finally , I have dinner with my family - always at 20.00 !
We eat a light meal and fruit .
What is my favourite Portuguese meal ?
It 's pork which is seasoned with red wine and , then , is well braised .
But the most famous dish uses cod .
Good luck ! Best wishes !

He had a long day ahead of him .
Tom was the kind of person that is always there for his friends .
He was always doing things for them or anyone who asked him .
He lived in Toronto , which is cold city , but which is even colder at 5 am , the time when Tom 's day began .
Tom had a series of things he had to do for his friend Rob before 2 pm and had to start as fast as he could .
His first stop was the car garage where he had to pay and take his friend Rob 's car .
The price was supposed to be 10 pounds , but they end up being 25 pounds , so Tom had to put money from his own pocket .
As a concecuence , he had no money to pay for a sod , so he was thirsty all morning .
After taking the car out of the garage , he had to drive all the way to the airport and wait for Rob to come .
But the plane had a delay of 20 minutes .
Tom was getting really anxious , worryng that he would never make it back to his job at 2 pm , the flight arrived .
Tom drove back to town and then walked really fast to his work .
It was a quarter to two , so tom laid back in his chair , took a big breath and waited for his workmates to come .
It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
Welcome to Russia !
Everybody visiting this country would like to see the most important sights , and I might be helpful there .
How about Red Square ?
It is one os the most significant places in our capital , Moscow .
First of all , I would like to make it clear that " red " is not related to the colour only , this word also means " beautiful " in Russian .
Then , this is the spot where all - nation celebrations take place , like civil and military parades or seeing the New Year in !
Moreover , in Red Square one can see the Muasoleum , which is also can be called one of the symbols of our capital and the country .
The amazing Saint Basil 's Cathedral is located nearby .
If you visit my country one day , I will certainly be pleased to show you Red Square and everything I 've told you about .
I am proud of my country !
What is cultural literacy ?
I was researching some definitions of cultural literacy .
It seems to me that the following definitions show an overall context of what is cultural literacy .
Cultural literacy is the ability to understand and participate fluently in a given culture .
Cultural literacy is Knowing about and respecting the cultures of others .
In order to be culturally literate , you need to be familiar with all manner of things , from Waterloo , Hamlet and " Call me Ishmael , " to the Wife of Bath , the Magna Carta , Tutankhamen , the Pythagorean Theorem and 1066 .
To be familiar with something is far different from being an expert in it , and it 's entirely manageable .
A literate reader knows the object - language 's alphabet , grammar , and a sufficient set of vocabulary ; a culturally literate person knows a given culture 's signs and symbols , including its language , particular dialectic , stories , entertainment , idioms , idiosyncrasies , and so on .
The culturally literate person is able to talk to and understand others of that culture with fluency , while the culturally illiterate person fails to understand culturally - conditioned allusions , references to past events , idiomatic expressions , jokes , names , places , etc .
According to UNESCO literacy is at the heart of basic education for all and that creating literate environments and societies is essential for achieving the goals of eradicating poverty , reducing child mortality , curbing population growth , achieving gender equality and achieve sustainable development , peace and democracy .
My personal opinion cultural literacy is the way to understand , learn and know about other cultures .
Also you can be understood by other cultures .
Nowadays , the majority of teenagers are not so close with their families as they used to be and mostly they are farther apart from their parents .
The age between 13 to 19 is the revolutionary one .
It has been shown that they get along better with their siblings than their parents .
I share this opinion with the revolutionary ones .
I get along with my siblings very well but we do not see each other very much .
As a result , we often communicate and we do not exchange opinions as much as other families do . I do not consider them to be my best friends because I can not speak with them as freely as with my friends .
Not to mention that when I am trying to talk to them they always space out and then say that they have their own problems .
That really gets on my nerves .
A friend will stay on and listen to you in patience .
To sum up , I do not consider my family to be my best friends and neither they do .
I think it is fair to say basketball is one of the most popular sports on the planet , both in number of viewers and players .
There is probably an array of motives to explain such phenomenon but for me that happens for one particular reason ; the shot clock .
The shot clock is a timer that dictates the amount of time during which one team can maintain possession of the ball .
The idea behind it is to quicken the pace of the game and preventing it from becoming stalled .
A corious fact is that out of the five most popular sports in the world only basketball keeps track of possession time and to me that 's exactly what sets him apart from the others .
While watching or playing any kind of sport , there 's nothing worse than a team or a player trying to waste time untill the clock runs out , the game becomes dull and boring and you ca n't enjoy the excitment that only the uptempo style of play can provide .
The bottom line is ; a fast paced game is a much more exciting experince for players and viewers as opposed to a slow paced one and that makes the " shot clock " fundamental to the dynamics of the game .
And for anyone trying to become a good basketball players the two most important things to understand ( as it is for most sports in general ) are the values of practice and awareness .
Practice is the one thing that can increase the probability of desireable results and awareness is what gives you the ability to adapt to different situations , and the combination of the two is the only way to success , so if you want to be a good player you need to put your energy and focus on practice and stay alert and surveing the court at all times so you can be aware of what is happening around you .
Some people claim that the youth of today is less healthy than they were two decades ago .
Although several causes for this problem can be found in the modernisation of our society , this modern society can also provide solutions for the amelioration of the level of fitness of young people .
One of the reasons for the worsening of the health of young people is the increasing use of cars .
Nowadays , parents take their children everywhere by car , whereas they would have to go everywhere by bike or by foot twenty years ago .
This is a result of the decreasing price of cars due to innovation in the car industry , which enabled more and more people to buy a car ( and use it ) .
However , possibilities to make the youth healthier are also provided by our modern civilisation .
For example , commercials can be used to stimulate youngsters to take up exercise by showing the positive effects .
In conclusion , I feel that not only the ground for the low level of fitness of today 's youth , but also the clue to get youngsters fitter , lies in the modernity .
Good thriller movies have become increasingly rare in the last few years , and to find some among big productions casting famous actors is even harder , if not impossible .
Most of these , in fact , have very predictable plots , are full of cliches and since it 's so easy to figure out how they will end , they are usually very boring .
This is why I was very surprised when I came out of the theater after seeing " Looper " and thought " Hey , I just saw a thriller with Bruce Willis in it , and it was actually a really good one ! "
The story is set in the future , about thirty years from now , when time travel had been invented but was used only by criminal organizations who sent those they want killed in the past where a professional killer , a looper , was waiting for them and for the silver strapped to their body .
The main character is Joe , a looper who has to face an older version of himself sent back in time to be killed .
By letting his older self go Joe changes his past , and therefore his future , leading to a series of unexpected events , and to an even more unexpected ending !
My expectations were not very high , but I have to say the movie was surprisingly good , in fact it was not boring at all , and had a few big twists which took me completely by surprise .
Time travelling is only a means to the development of the story , and the future society is quite similar to the present one , so even if you are not big science fiction fans , I suggest you give this movie a chance , I am sure you wo n't be disappointed .
In the competitive world that we inhabit , dominating a technique and having a deep knowledge of a given field is essential for both academic and professional success .
We 've reached a point where this training starts at an early age in the form of extracurricular activities , such as music classes , learning languages and playing sports .
The inherent tendency to provide the best to our offspring catalyze parents to invest in their kids as to prepare them for an unpredictable future .
The haste that results from this process does n't allow parents to think over some potentially harmful myths that they take for reality , regardless that it may compromise their kid 's motivation and self - confidence , all because of their " is talent innate or can it be acquired ? " .
Contemporarily , the most wide - spread belief is that some people are born with a talent and some unlucky ones simply are n't .
This assertion may boost the confidence of parents whose children show a remarkable ability in the early infancy , as though this capability could be the celestial sign that their toddler is gifted or going to grow as child prodigy .
The adepts of this idea usually mention extraordinary people in order to reinforce their own believe in their child 's potential to become a known genius .
One of the most common examples is Beethoven , known for composing high - quality piano pieces as a young child .
Little known is what was the role played by music in his life and how was his relationship with it previous to his first deed .
Admittedly , I do n't know it myself .
Any one who challenges the aforementioned common - sense is n't immediately drawn to embrace and believe the less common , but still popular and not scientific , concurrent idea .
Many do believe that a talent can be taught , although not so easily .
The " 10 000-hours rule " is said to have a scientific base , in spite of the fact that most of its defendants have never read the study that stablished it .
According to this rule , any person can develop a talent after 10 000 hours of training .
This amount of time does n't fit normal workers and students ' tight schedules and busy daily lives , therefore being labeled as unpractical and unachievable .
The normal response to this conclusion is , as I and many people who gave up learning a language simply because fluency is out of reach if you do n't have this time available , is the loss of motivation .
The main problem of having these two perspectives on talent is that both of them are basically negative .
Either of them put a heavy burden on parents and on their children .
One asserts that talent is a matter of luck ; the second , of pure time demanding and presumably expensive dedication .
Clearly , both rely on the common beliefs to be sustained .
As any other unscientific " truth " that circulates and cause harm to our society , this one can only be eliminated through the reading of scientific and specialised publications on the topic , so that the effective manners of becoming talented in something can be adopted , before the popular believes take our motivation and self - belief away .
This research project will provide us with better understanding and insights into this area through the EM trainees ' narratives and experiences of clinical reasoning development in ED and add to the scientific discourse in clinical reasoning .
As discussed , clinical reasoning is still poorly understood and a variety of ways of articulating and conceptualizing clinical reasoning can provide richer means of understanding what is involved in clinical encounters ( Loftus , 2012 ) .
A narrative approach to explore and investigate clinical reasoning development can provide a vocabulary that encourages us to integrate insights from different frameworks in ways that combine the strengths of each .
Dear John ,
I live in Italy and you should know that food is very important for us !
Many people do breakfast in the bar with an espresso or a cappuccino and a croissant .
In the morning we 're not used to eating salty food like salami , eggs or cheese .
Working people usually have lunch at about 13.00 and they have something simple such a pasta or a sandwich and a coffee because the break is short and they have to go back to work and need to be concentrate and do n't get asleep !
During the day Italian people drink a lot of coffee and everyone has a coffee maker at home !
Young people do not drink coffee : they prefer to drink Coke while eating junk food , which is cheaper and tastier than pastasciutta .
The time for dinner is not the same in all parts .
In northern Italy people eat at about 19 , whereas in southern Italy they eat at about 21 . I get home late and I have no time to cook elaborate meals so I usually cook a steak with vegetables .
Sometimes I give myself a slice of homemade cake .
Italian eat also a lot of fruits like apples , oranges and other fruit of the season .
On Saturdays or Sundays we do n't have to work , so we have time to cook and we prepare typical Italian food with two or more courses .
I really like the lasagna , made with a flat and long pasta with bechamel , tomatoes and meat and I love the pasta Amatriciana made with spaghetti , fresh tomatoes , bacon and a typical Roman cheese called pecorino .
Another typical dish from the northern Italy ( it comes from the mountains ) is pizzoccheri which is a wheat pasta topped with cabbages , butter and typical cheese .
Every region has a typical food and a typical cheese .
I once read that in Italy we produce 450 different cheeses and I do n't think a foreigner would try them all !
I 'm talking about Gorgonzola cheese , which tastes really strong and is n't very nice because it has a blue mould inside .
I remember having tasted the " casu marzu " , a typical Sardinian cheese which has some little worm inside !
However , eating is for us a tradition that puts the families together and recipes are handed down from generation to generation .
I hope I 've helped you !
Best wishes ,
Roberta Trentino
What happened to me is not the reason for my mood but I 'm sure it contributed .
My first night here I was invited to a dinner mainly for scientists who are up here doing a radio show .
I 'm placed next to Brain Cox and something inside me wilts because I know I am sitting next to a superior being and he will soon find out I 'm a two - celled worm .
I am next to someone who knows what happened to make the big bang , he sees atoms and electrons and even knows what they are .
He does n't think about things that I , a mere mortal does , like whether or not there is food on my teeth , and death .
To me he is greater than any rock star squared .

Although educated people in the past had the same desire to learn as educated people today , those who were considered educated in the past would be considered less educated today .
That 's because there 're many scientific facts have been revealed .
Furthermore , information about these facts have become much more available .
Also , people today tend to get higher degrees than people in the past .
The great expansion of knowledge makes people more educated than before .
Today , people know more about phenomena that were considered obscure in the past .
For example , people today know more about space , genetics , and diseases .
That makes them more educated .
Furthermore , it 's easy to know about these valuable discoveries .
There 're many more libraries and learning courses available than before .
In addition , information about anything can be found easily on the Internet .
In the past , graduating from high school was considered an achievement ; today it 's not .
To be considered well educated , people should graduate from a college .
Also , there 're more people who continue their education after graduation from college .
In conclusion , the average level of education in the past is n't enough today to be considered educated .
This winter , I may be able to travel to Cornwall , UK .
Going to the UK has been a dream of mine but going to Cornwall , however , might be a little of an escapade during the winter , considering that I 'm only used to the relatively hot Egyptian weather .
I have read that Cornwall is usually flooded in winter , and that the weather might make transportation a pain .
However , I 'm interested & excited about the journey because it will allow me to have a myriad of new experiences .
On the other hand , I hear people are generally convivial and nature is beautiful in Cornwall .
I hope that my fortitude will help me during this short sojourn .
My life has been on a boring plateau for a while now and I was looking for a change as well as more personal burgeon .
A historical place of importance in my country .
There is a place , in my country , which played a very important role during World Ward II .
This is a forest , crossed by the border between France and Switzerland .
As it was full of spruces , it was easy to hide from the German patrols and people from both sides of the border helped Jewish , spies and English , Canadian or American pilots to flee through Switzerland .
A net took place from South of France to Switzerland , espescially to try to save thousands of Jewish children .
People who participated to that " way to freedom " never asked anything in exchange .
They did it freely .
They never spoke about it till a few years ago , as they were considered like criminals by their countries as they had broken the law during that time .
But now , they told the whole world about it , some of them are now considered as heroes in Insrael for what they did during these hard times .
Their story was written and folks finally could discover what happened there between the years nineteen thirty - nine and nineteen forty - five .
Last month a monument was erected in their memory so that nobody forgets what happened in that large forest where - as the people would say in that time - German soldiers can not guard all wood , unless they stood behind each spruce ....
Nowadays , public transport is a useful and convenient way of travelling , especially for students , people with low socioeconomic status or for everyone who wants to go to work or school by bus , train or by subway .
It 's also true that more people have cars than maybe 30 of 40 years ago .
Cars are a good way of saving time especially when waiting for public transport , mainly , buses .
But a disadvantage it that cars maintenance and gas is more expensive than paying for public transport .
On the other hand , cars are always there when you need them and you do n't have to depend on anything when you have a car .
Airplanes are becoming more and more useful for people who travel for work or even want to get to another place quicker and safer .
I also think that there would be fewer people using public transport in the future but some will still be available because it wo n't be possible for everyone to afford to have a car or travelling by plane .
As in all educational processes , assessment of the programme planning must take place .
There are different ideas to be considered as far as assessment is concerned .
In the first place , we have to know why we evaluate .
The function of evaluation and assessment must not only be the recognition of the results of the learning process itself , but also how this process took place , therefore we will need to use different instruments of assessment .
After the assessment and evaluation we will be able to adjust the necessary pedagogic help to individual students , know up to which point the proposed aims have been achieved and we will be able to judge the programme planning as a whole .
Assessment and evaluation will provide information , as well for the teacher as for the students .
The teacher will understand the student 's difficulties better ; s / he will know the level of assimilation of the different kinds of contents and be able to modify future programme planning .
As far as the students are concerned , they will be able to correct inadequate strategies or behaviour , know the difficulties they encounter in the learning - teaching process and evaluate their proper process .
Secondly , we must be sure of what to assess and evaluate .
As to the students , we will have to consider the knowledge and skills they have acquired , their attitudes and their social behaviour .
As to the teacher , we will find out whether the programme planning was adequate or not and if s / he was sufficiently implied in the learning - teaching process .
Thirdly , we have to keep in mind the instruments for assessment and evaluation we are going to use .
For our programme planning , we propose the following instruments or techniques :
Society is continually changing , ever since we create the first civilizations .
However , it has a special importance nowadays , in a world that moves so quickly .
The first thing that comes to mind on this subject is technology .
It has such a quick growth that it 's impossible to predict how much transformation it will suffer .
It should make a lot of tasks easier and more efficient but , apart from that , I do n't expect it to have a deep impact on our lives , considering other aspects that will certainly overcome this one .
That brings us to second point : resources .
As the population grows exponentially , the resouces fail to go along .
We have just started worrying about that but the actions in course are far from enough .
The hard truth is that until somenoe has to face the situation himself , it 's quite difficult to restrain from wasting energy , food , materials , water ...
But in the near future most of us will have to deal with it and therefore be forced to make dramatic changes in our lives in order to survive .
Finally , and on a more positive tone , we 're walking towards a global world .
This means borders are getting thinner and thinner , and cultures more and more similar .
As this may cause us to lose traditions and cultural identity , it will definitely bring more opportunities for everyone .
Dear Jo ,
It 's great to hear from you !
It 's really good that you 're coming to Uruguay , I would be pleased to help you .
First of all , there are a lot of places to visit here and I would like to take you to , Punta del Este , Piriapolis , Cabo Polonio , La paloma and other beautiful places .
You have a lot of hotels to stay if you want to be more than a day and the people is really nice , or if you want you can stay at my house of course .
Secondly , You can find a job here in Montevideo or if you like in the countryside .
You could work in a public office for example .
For people who come from other countries like you , there are a lot of internships and I can assure you that you will find a great job , there are also companies that are hiring people to work for a short period of time in their call centers .
Finally , tell me if you want to go to a particular place or do some activity that you have in mind .
I 'm looking forward to see you soon !
We will have a great time together here in Uruguay , You will meet some of the most popular places of this beautiful conuntry .
See you soon ,
Felipe
The pupils have been taught English since their very first meeting with the English language in school so they are completely familiar in using English as classroom language .
In this course design we have also chosen activities that we consider suitable to be taught about in English .
The only place where we could imagine a challenge in sticking to English as the classroom language is when the group works .
The evaluation starts by unfolding the brain storm from day 1 , and then it continues by the pupils applying all their new words and knowledge about America .
Hereby we want to create consciousness in the pupils'minds about their new knowledge .
The end of the evaluation is that every pupil writes a post - it note that answers the following questions : What have I learned from this course ?
What did I like most about this course ?
How could the course be improved ?
Hereby we both want the pupils to reflect their learning and bring the teacher valuable information for the next time .
In this class there are strong wishes about certain areas regarding America that the pupils want to learn : 10 pupils would like to learn about American High School Life , 4 pupils would like to learn about National Parks in America , 4 pupils would like to learn about Native Americans and 1 pupil would like to learn about American Motor Industry .
Taking the importance of learner autonomy and the importance of the pupils'motivation into consideration we have decided that they can follow their interests in this course .
This also gives the pupils the possibility of presenting their classmates to new knowledge - and the communicative situation is authentic .
Kyiv is a good destination for the shoppoholics .
Here you can find well - known brands as well as locally produced items .
For those interested in top fashion brands I would recommend visiting the shops in the main street .
The best manufacturers of clothes , linnen , accessories have their shops there . Jewellery and watch shops can also be found nearby .
For those who are looking for cheap , but practical clothes I will recommend to go to one of the shopping malls of the capital .
Mass market clothes , bags , cosmetics , children toys are represented there .
There are also supermarkets in each shopping mall , where you can buy food and beverages as well as housekeeping items .
If you are interested in local design , vintage clothes and remarkable souvenirs , go to the historical center of the city .
Different shops will offer a wide range of goods and impresse with interesting design ideas and unique style .
The main shopping mall of the city is under reconstruction at the moment , but in one year it will be open for visitors and will surprise them with high tech design and exclusive brands .
And if you try to find a good product for a reasonable price visit the city 's outlet - collections of the previous years are sold there with significant discounts .

Why people become homeless ?
One of the reasons is they are poor because they can not get a job .
I believe we can decline the number of homeless people in Japan by providing them with information and skills .
Those who become homeless usually do not know that there is a system to help poor people .
For example , if they do not have enough money that is needed to have home and to buy things necessary to live , they can get a financial support by government .
However , those who do not know about it can not get such support .
Homeless people tend to unable to collect information because of lack in means to do it .
We need to let them get information .
Skills are also needed to get a job .
The skills include the ability to communicate with people and to conquer hardships .
I have seen a TV program about homeless people .
In the program , one homeless man quit his job because he could not have a good relationship in the office .
He tried several jobs but he could communicate well in none of them .
He was tired of himself , lost interest in working and became homeless .
Then , he came to know that there was a class that provide homeless people with skills of cleaning floor for free .
He decided to join the class .
Sometimes the lesson was hard , but the staff there praised him when he did well .
Little by little , he grew interest in working .
He came to know how pleasant it is to overcome hard situations .
He also learned to how to build a good relationship with people through talking his fellows .
He finally wanted to find a job again .
If more lessons like this are provided and more homeless people get the skills , the problem of homelessness will become less serious .
To conclude , giving information about support that they can receive from the government , and skills is very helpful way to solve homelessness in Japan .
At the moment , all governments around the world argue about climate change .
Some of them think global warming is the most significant problem , despite others believe deforestation has a higher impact on our world .
Now I will discuss both sides .
On the one hand , global warming is a result of many emitted toxic gases .
These are , for example , carbon dioxide and methane .
As we all know , trees store carbon dioxide .
So , we can say , with less deforestation there would be less global warming .
But what are the results of global warming ?
The primary outcome is the increasing temperature , and this leads to melting glaciers .
These glaciers are habitat for polar bears and many other arctic animals .
The melting glacier will bring a higher sea level .
That means coastal cities will be flooded .
This flooding leads to starvation because of fewer harvest yields and this creates many refugees .
On the other hand deforestation is , as said , another part of global warming due to less carbon dioxide storing trees .
But incinerate a huge part of the rainforest means a destruction of the habitat of wildlife .
Global warming is a primary cause of starvation but also does deforestation .
Because the roots do not hold the fertile soil , and now , it will be blown away by the wind .
To sum up both issues have enormous impacts on our world .
In both animals and people are affected .
But in my opinion , you can stop global warming by stopping deforestation first .
Then you can focus on global warming .
Michael and Cecilia had been married for 6 years .
Even though their couple was of the quarelling type , everyone around them , friends and family agreed on the fact that the pair was as solid as a rock , and despite the ups and downs , love had always won in the end .
But sometimes , Michael had a tendency to go too far with his words .
And each time it occurred , Cecilia burst in tears , and Michael had to rock his sobbing wife like a baby .
They had kept trying to have a baby for years , but despite their attempts , no child ever came .
Michael grew bitter .
He was torturing Cecilia with reproaches .
One night he went away slamming the door , still cursing while running down the stairs .
It took him three days to calm down and put the things in perspective .
When he finally came back home , his wife was nowhere to be seen ... Michael rushed to the bedroom .
Going straight to the wardrobe , he opened its door .
It was empty ...
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Nowadays , experience is more important than academic knowledge to gain a job .
Employers try to find employees that have practical skills rather than formal qualifications .
However , experience is extremely important , I disagree that the academics are not important .
First of all , formal education is essential for employees , it is considered as a fundamental basis of any practical job .
Success in a job depends on the amount of theoretical knowledge that a person had in academic institution .
In addition , every phenomenon is based on theory .
When employees face any problems or difficulties in work , it must be referred to the theory that explain this phenomenon , without knowing this theory employees ca n't overcome these difficulties , for instance , engineering science seems practical , but each part of engineering science is based on theories .
Thereby , engineers must take demanding knowledge to be successful in a career .
Second of all , theoretical qualifications are crucial for employees , as it helps t people to think and solve all problems in a fair way .
Scientific approach is more important to deal with problems , beginning with determining problems and then studying all factors and related information .
Then employees are able to suggest the best solution , this approach is developed in formal education .
Moreover , studying in a university provides an opportunity to interact with a wide range of people and thus build unique communication skills that are very important for employees .
Finally , knowledge could make an open - mined person who has ability to deal with problems in fairway .
To conclude , theoretical knowledge is more important than practical skills .
It is the main part that helps employees to be successful in careers .
It is certainly true that markets can not abandon the formal qualification in future .
Some people are convinced that public transport has no future because the car is so much more convenient .
There is more than one way to look at this statement .
The use of public transport has a lot of advantages , but on the other hand , some disadvantages can be distinguished .
It depends on where and what kind of place you want to reach and it depends on the time of the day
In this article both sides are discussed .
First what are the advantages of using the bus , or train ?
When traveling to city centers , choosing public transport is to be advised , because parking a car in the city is really expensive and it is very hard to find a space .
When in the center and wanting to enjoy various sights , by car it is hard to get from on place to the other , because the circulation is dense .
IN that way it will take a lot of your time , while the bus or tramway have their own bus lanes , and hence are running smoothly .
In that case the choice for public transport will be preferable .
When traveling to rural areas , it is quite difficult by public transport , because sometimes there is hardly any no train or bus for the far out places and the tiny villages .
Another problem might be the timetable .
Because not may people going to these places , the schedule will be very tight and the bus will only leave once every hour .
If there is a bus or train available , it will stop at almost every village .
Most of these buses will make many stops which makes it even more time consuming .
In the end of the day you should choose public transport or car according to the purpose of your trip .
And sometimes public transport is better and sometimes using the car is better .
The Jirga is a ' traditional system ' of justice , which is actively practiced in , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Baluchistan as well as in districts of Sindh bordering with Baluchistan as to resolve legal cases and disputes .
The system , which was in practice since the British rule , was modified under the ' Special Provision Ordinance ( Criminal Provisions 11 ) of 1968 ' .
Besides dispensing justice and dealing with judicial cases , the Jirga also covers all important aspects of monetary , political , and communal life of tribal society .
However , in its present form , the tribal Jirga especially in Sindh province has generated heated debate about its legal position as well as conflict of its rules and codes with the constitution of Pakistan , law of the land or formal justice system as well as international human rights standards and conventions .
Strongest allegation on the Jirga system or ' informal justice system ' has been its unfairness against innocents during the course of decisions and execution on variety of its rules and regulations .
This informal system of justice is being practiced in rural areas of Sindh and Baluchistan .
In fact informal justice system is directly proportional to the Jirga that originally owns its roots to Baloch culture and had been transferred to Sindhi society progressively .
" Historically , the Jirga System dates back to the days of Naseer Khan of Kalat , Baluchistan .
He was the Khan of Kalat from 1741 to 1795 .
Naseer Khan was an able General , trained at the court of Ahmad Shah Abdali , the hero of the third battle of famous Pani Pat . "
In recent years , many nations are developing their own economy rapidly , and it takes that many areas of farmlands and forests are being cut down to build a better and bigger house and a more convenient transportation system .
However , many countries have become more aware of the environmental issues each nation faces .
In my opinion , we need a more convenient life but also to maintain a certain balance .
Frist of all , the biggest problem is that the world 's resources are extremely unequal .
For example , Japan is the world 's third largest economy after the United States and China , its economy is so developed , but food , oil , and other resources are all imported , and it put a lot of heavy industry into developing countries in order to protect its own environment .
This has led to a growing gap between the rich and the poor , while the environment is also getting worse and worse .
Secendly , with the increasing of the earth 's population , the area of farmland is also decreasing .
People in economically developed areas are in the pursuit of the perfect life and the people in the undeveloped areas are strving .
So I think that the government must do something in this respect .
The government should find a balance point between economic development and agricultural development .
I think that it would have to develop science and technology such as Yuan Longping 's hybrid rice , or after the food can make people 's great and then vigorously develop the economy .
As part of the same planet , protecting the global environment is not only the task of the government but also the task of each of us .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing to apply for one of the jobs in the summer camp that you advertised on the Internet .
I am in my final year of high school which I will leave with a university entrance qualification in July of this year .
I am looking for a job in the USA to improve my English and to gain more experience working with children as I want to become a primary school teacher .
I have babysat children of different ages for the last 4 years and have found that so far very satisfying .
In addition , I have privately coached 5th and 6th grade pupils in Mathematics , English , German and French for the last 3 years .
The people I have worked for find me a reliable , communicative , well - organised and cheerful person .
I have been told that I am quite good with children .
My babysitting duties were to bring the children to bed , provide lunch or dinner , play with and read to them .
With regard to the tutorials . I have put together my own exercise material , looked and discussed class tests and helped the pupils with their homework .
Since I worked twice as a group instructor at a local summer camp , I think that I am well - equipped to deal with 8 - 12 year old children from the experience I mentioned .
I hope you will invite me for a job interview , via Skype or in in person and look forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours faithfully ,
Tessa Foerster
I had never felt so nervous before in my life ... !
I will never forget this particular day .
It was a lovely day .
That is why my parents decided to go on a bike trip to the forest outside our city .
I had never been there before , so I thought - why not ?
We set off at 6 pm and reached our destination an hour later .
Suddenly , it got so dark , that I could not see a thing .
I started shouting as my parents were out of sight , but nobody answered .
After a while I started shaking - I was alone in a forest !
I tried to call my mother , but while I was typing her number on the keypad , the battery ran out of power ...
So there was nothing better to do but stay in the same place and wait for someone to help me .
Luckily , it was quite warm , so there was one thing less to worry about .
I did not have to wait so long , though - after a while I saw our car 's lights glowing in the darkness .
I felt relieved .
Next time I will be going on such a trip I need to make sure that I have a fully charged mobile with me .

Enclosure : CV
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing in reply to your job advertisement that I saw some days ago and I think this would be the right opportunity for me .

I would be grateful if you could attend this matter as soon as possible .

Flaminia Bruna Mancini
It was a rainy afternoon , and I had discovered the letter that ruined my life . I would never be the same again . I was at home looking out of the window , when the phone rang .
I could never have guessed what was about to happen .
While the phone was ringing , I felt shivers down my spine .
" Hello " I said , feeling like something was wrong , while the person on the other side kept talking .
And then I heard those three words : " He is dead . "
I rushed to his house , not believing what I had just been told .
I got into his bedroom , and there it was : the letter .
I suddenly knew what had happened , he took his own life , and my heart broke .
I had never expected that . I had lost my best friend , and I could not do a thing about it .
From that moment on , my life changed forever .
There are no words to explain how much I miss him .
Crazy Grandma
Grandparents are the best .
I love my grandpa and grandma a lot .
Since grandpa passed away I started loving my grandma even more .
Grandma is so sweet , but at the same time crazy as well .
She does amazing things .
I admire her very much .
That woman knows how to put a smile on kid 's face .
Granny has grey straight hair , deep blue eyes and tiny nose .
She also has pale complexion and black dark circles under eyes .
Grandma 's wrinkled face can be horrofying at night .
That is why I avoid going to the bathroom at night .
Fear of seeing granny at night is stronger than anything else .
She has a really skinny body , and her hand are long and covered in brown spots .
Nana talks in such a peaceful way .
Tone of her voice is so gentle and so calm .
It calmes me down and freaks me out at the same time .
Parents told me that grandma is a very sick person .
When I go to sleep she is constantly sitting beside me .
And also she is watching me with eyes wide opened .
Lately I could n't get enough sleep because of that .
Nana gives me feeling like I will get killed in my sleep .
It feels just like a horror move .
Reality is killing me .
I love her but she scares the hell out of me .
While sleeping I can feel her rubbing my feet and touching my head .
It is creepy feeling .
She does n't want to leave me .
I do n't know why .
Maybe she is afraid of dying alone .
I know she is ill .
But I never thought that it can be that serious .
I love my grandma .
She might be crazy , but I love her .
Feeling scared all the time will not stop me from loving her .
Understanding is the most important thing in this world .
We will never stop loving our grandparents !
My favourite TV show is " Pretty Little Liars " .
This show is about four girls , called Aria , Emily , Spencer and Hannah .
The Girls used to hang out together , they spent all their free time together and they were absolutely best friends .
Allison was the girl who joined the group together : all of the girls liked her and she was always the centre of attention .
One night , they were sleeping in a barn and when Aria woke up , Spencer and Allison were gone !
Suddenly Spencer came to the barn , again and told her friends that she had n't seen Allison , instead she thought she 'd heard her scream .
From this day on , the girls drift apart .
Aria moves to Iceland and the other girls lose contact , and Allison is still missing .
When Aria comes home from Iceland , again , the girls get mysterious messages only signed with the letter " A " .
All of the messages include the girls ' secrets oh Allison knew .
And then , Allisons body is found .
In the show , the friends try to find out who " A " is a show Allison was murdered while " A " turns their lives into hell .
I love the show , because it is completely thrilling and scary .
If you are a famous person , people believe you have a wonderful life .
Nevertheless , being famous has both its benefits and drawbacks .
First of all , celebrities are usually wealthy , so they have an easier life than other people .
Luxurious homes , cars , expensive clothes and other pleasures of life are then available when people become famous .
Moreover , they travel all around the world and spend their holidays in expensive resorts , get the best hotel rooms and the most efficient service .
On the other hand , lack of privacy is a major disadvantage in a famous person 's life as their personal life 's boundaries are constantly trespassed by paparazzi and journalists .
Besides , the more they succeed , the more their fans expect of them to achieve .
Owing to this state of constant stress , many of them are bound to have alcoholism problems , drug - addiction and depression .
In conclusion , fame may be nice but it 's not an easy path to walk on .
You have money but you do not feel safe , you have friends but you can never be sure if they like you or your money .
Hello John ,
I 'm really glad to spend six months in the UK , but it 's really important to plan my days in order to have a good time .
First of all , I would like to work for at least three months in a language school in London as Italian teacher .
In this way I 'd had the chance to know different people from all over the world and at the same time I 'd earn some money to visit the city and the castles of England , where many historical battles were fought .
I was wondering if you do n't mind asking around if a school is looking for a part - time teacher .
After leaving London I 'd love to do two months of volunteering at a children hospital in York .
I read in an ad on the internet that young people are asked to amuse sick children and I 'd be really happy to tear them a smile !
Will you help me writing a striking curriculum ?
My stay is going to conclude with a trip I 've always dreamed : the Cornwall .
I 'm meeting two friends of mine in Bristol where we 're renting a little car and we 're travelling without destination !
What do you think of my plan ?
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you !
Thank you for your advice , kisses !
It had been a hot , summer day .
Michel 's parents were out so it was the perfect excuse to have an amazing party in the living room , even though they forbid him meeting with friends .
When the night fall and all the guests had arrived , Michael started to lose control of the situation .
Suddenly , a deafening noise coming from the dining room stopped the party but nobody knew what happened .
Almost immediately the house was empty , and music turned off , letting Michael realise that his grandmother 's vase valued in £ 2000 was broken down .
His parents finally came back after three days but it was obvious that something was wrong .
Michael decided to blame the dog for the unfortunate incident and when he told his father what had happened automatically he put the dog up for adoption as it was n't the first time , despite of Michael 's attempts to avoid him doing it .
Once they had arrived to the shelter the family started to say goodbye to the dog crying out loud .
Without looking back and getting into the car , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
I would like to apply for the 12-month Internship Programme ( Marketing and Client Relations team ) at ICG as advertised on the Cambridge Careers website .
This position will allow me to gain an insight into the asset management industry .
The reputation for stability and consistency and the global leadership in mezzanine finance are my main reasons for applying to ICG .
Being awarded the " Private Equity Awards : Debt Firm of the Year 2013 " by Financial News has further confirmed my desire to work for this leading asset manager .
I am very interested in working in the financial markets .
Having lived in four different cities ( Brighton , London , Manchester and Cambridge ) in the UK , I have become more flexible to new environment and keen to accept new challenges .
In addition , I believe my international exposure and fluency in English , Mandarin and Cantonese will be an invaluable asset to the company .
Given my strong academic background and my leadership experiences at university , including the completion of Manchester Leadership Programme , I believe I am a strong candidate for this position . I enclose a copy of my CV and hope very much to be invited for interview .
Of course she was really afraid , because if she accepted that job , she would have to move to New York City .
She had dreamed of living there since she was a little girl , but she also realized that she will leave all the people that she cared about .
At this point , no one knew that she did the interview and the interviewer told her that the job was hers .
Not even her boyfriend knew about this , and she felt ashamed because deep inside her , she did knew that he will feel betrayed and probably he did n't want to be with her anymore .
But if she did n't take this job , she would regret it her whole life , and live with that was something she was not willing .
So , she picked up all her stuff , left a note , and tearfully closed the door .
She thought that she could have done things different , but it was too late to change them .
I am writing to you regarding your job advertisement .

In addition , as a mother of 8 and 12 years old boys , I have a vast knowledge of children 's psychology and am an excellent cook .

Very often people say " Family is the most important thing in life " or " My family is my biggest support " , and I agree .
When something important happens , the first person I will call is a member of my family .
But then , every once and a while , one can also hear stories of brothers fighting over the inheritance , or a parent not speaking to their child for making a wrong life decision .
In the majority of cases , members of a family have the same blood and genes and they also share living space .
This results in common opinions , support when there 's a problem and mutual understanding without many words .
On the other hand , we tend to have higher expectations and less patience when it comes to our loved ones .
The members of your family in deed are your best friends , but only if you do n't take them for granted , if you respect them and their space and opinion .
One should also bear in mind that sometimes it 's necessary to compromise , especially when it comes to material or financial issues .
Once you accept that your sibling , although similar , is n't the same as you , or that your child has a different view on their future , it 's easier to embrace the differences and be a supportive family member .
And at the end of the day , nothing can beat homemade comfort food and a laugh with your family .
I have been asked last week to write a report about the best places for young people in my area .
Those are my findings and my recommendations .
1- Facts and Findings .
- The unrivaled place for young people is the municipal center for youth .
This innovative center has a lot of first - class facilities for young people .
It has a professional rehearsal studio that local music groups can just rent for pocket money , they can also rent instruments by paying a small refundable deposit .
A small cinema , a library , games rooms , a TV - room with an enormous flat screen TV where teenagers usually watch football matches , a basic gym , and a little arena .
- The second best place is a private disco for youngsters .
It was renewed last year and regulars like it a lot .
The main problem is the high price of the tickets .
Kids have to pay 10 euros just for the entrance getting anything else .
- There is another place where local youth spend a lot of hours the new and magnificent mall .
It has 150 stores and about 40 fast food shops .
They especially like the music store and a magnificent t - shirt store owned by two local designers , there you can design your own item and collect it the following week .
These are the main places where young people usually go .

The importance of cleanliness around us is not understood till it takes a toll on our health .
An individual must be aware of the result of his act on the environment , be it due to personal or professional act , in order to maintain it in healthy state .
In Clayton , my hometown , people are fond of maintaining the environment and they actively participate in encouraging the ones who try to work towards its progress as well as in protesting against the ones who tend to cause harm to it .
The municipal board of Clayton conducts meetings fortnightly to communicate about the improvements that have been made and that have been planned to be implemented in future in the town .
Representatives elected by respective communities attend the meeting .
It is then their responsibility to communicate the message to all members of their community .
These meetings are organized according to their planned schedule and the results were surprising .
Earlier , regardless of whether the rubbish was recyclable or not , it was disposed off in the same bin .
Later , people were educated regarding recyclable , non - recyclable and organic waste and were also informed that the rubbish was to be disposed - off in respective bins .
This rubbish was collected by the municipal board on a daily basis and proper disposal methods were employed .
Development was also happening at the same time which was good for our town , but , lots of trees were also cut down as a result .
People started protesting against them to avoid any further damage to the environment .
Hence , the municipal board decided to invite the developers as well in the meeting that was scheduled in a weeks time .
In the following meeting , it was decided that on the following Sunday everyone will be planting a tree that will be provided by the municipal board for free .
On the following Sunday , as discussed , trees were planted and before we realized , they started adding beauty to our town .
Taking care of environment is everyone 's duty and it must be performed responsibly .
The municipal board of Clayton does an excellent job in educating its people to keep the environment in a healthy state .
I hope people must take them as an example and introduce similar ideas in their own towns or villages .
After all , it is the place we all live in .
One day Michael woke up from a strange dream , the dream was focused from a camera that was following a shadow in front of it .
Everything was dark except for a ray of light that probably started at the end of that way .
The shadow kept walking and running from what Michael supposed it was a threat .
Michael was confused , he did n't know why he had dreamed that , he thought it would be better to forget about it so he stopped thinking about his dream .
That day Michael had to go to work , so he woke up from his bed and went to his bathroom .
When he was ready he took his keys and everything he needed , he locked the door and went to his job .
He took his car and drove to the flat .
When he arrived at the building where he worked he took the elevator and when to his floor .
Since he had entered the building he have had a strange feeling , when he arrived to his office Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Hi Jose ,
Further to our phone conversation of last week , I would like first to thank you for giving me this chance to talk to you , and following up on our discussion , please note that we have been approached by the purchasing department at the hospital to give them our maximum discount to secure the deal as a lot of brokers were quoting with a very competitive price which very close to our cost .
In light of the above , and as agreed I seek your kind help in approving the price of $ 30.00 per each to close this deal in a safe way .
Thank you and best regards ,

Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
He was in a deep forest and a young woman he had just met was about to give birth to her child .
Peter had already called an ambulance 30 minutes ago but it seemed that they could n't find them .
He knew he had to do something in this moment because otherwise something bad may happen ...
" Please , do something . I 'm scared " sighed the woman whose name was Mindy .
Peter took out his mobile , dialed 112 and told the dispatcher about that whole situation .
The dispatcher told Peter to calm down and check if he had scissors , towels and water in his car .
Then she tried to calm Mindy down and helped Peter to deliver the baby .
The dispatcher told him every little thing he had to do .
After an hour Mindy was holdin her baby- girl and Peter was trying to realize what had just happened .
" Never would have I thought that I 'll go out of my house and come back as almost an accousher ... " thought Peter when he was driving back home .
Computer 's have become an essential part of our lives in the last few decades .
They have replaced many things like books .
It is true that because of computers , we do many things fast and easily .
However , they stopped us from doing many fun things as well , what are those things , do we really need computers , are they really helping us ?
We use computers to help us with so many different types of things .
To begin with , they help us solve really complex mathematical equations .
They were invented to help us calculate things in the first place anyway .
Computers are an essential part of NASA , since they try to calculate really complex equations to help them solve the mysteries of space .
But us , ordinary people , do n't use computers to solve equations , we use them to type things , print things , design things , make games and to do much more ...
We made programs that make computers do very interesting things , like graphics .
And we use graphics to make all kinds of things , like games or 3D house models that help engineers .
Furthermore , the major thing that computers made easier for us is , communication .
Humans are social animals , we communicate because communication is in our genes , if we do n't communicate we go insane .
So computers help us do that , they help us share our thoughts and feelings with other people easily .
Finally , while doing this they actually save us from using a lot of paper .
So computers help us with so many things and also save trees .
In the other hand , computers have very bad effects on both to us , and the environment .
For example , research has shown that not computers themselves , but the things we use or play on them are addictive , like social networks or games .
Also looking at a screen is tiring for your eyes and if your eyes get too tired they can get damaged forever .
Despite the fact that computers decreased the use of paper , they 're still harmful to the environment since they consume tonnes of electricity .
Computers made our lives easier without doubt , so it is normal that they have some bad effects .
There is a saying in Turkish saying ' If you love a rose , you have to withstand against it 's spikes . ' .
So it is normal that computers have bad effects on us and the environment .
In my opinion computers might be the best invention ever made , since they 've become an essential part of our daily lives and since we rely on them so much .
To whom it may concern ,
Lucila Marcelo
Lucila Marcelo and I have met at secondary school and we have been friends for seven years .
We have also worked together in a kindergarten for some time and this year we started our studies in an institution in order to become primary teachers .
As a result of having shared many experiences together , I have come to know her and her abilities very well .
Lucila has proved herself to be extremely sincere and reliable person since I met her .
As a student , she is persistent and hardworking as well as respected by teachers and students because of her sympathy and kindness .
Lucila is the biggest out of six siblings so she is used to babysitting children .
In the past , she had some difficulty keeping her room neat , but , as she has grown up , she has become a far more disciplined and tidy person .
When we worked at the kindergarten she was very patient and caring with the children and also she was willing to help them whenever they had a problem , even if that implied had work for her .
I can confirm that she had a special connection with the kids : she was admired by them , who would spend a great time with her .
Lucila has been studying English for five years , and she is quite fluent .
Moreover , she has been to a camp in Australia in which she was a coordinator of a group of twenty kids .
As a result of her experience , Lucila has developed an incredible ability to solve any problem that may arise .
Lucila has always wanted to work with children and she is interested in a job that would also help her develop her English skills .
She would undoubtedly do an excellent job and for the reasons I have given I have no hesitation in supporting her application .
Yours faithfully ,
Schools and working life : a report
To the Italian education authorities
In this report , I will describe the school system in my country , point out its flaws and conclude giving suggestions about how they could be addressed .
The current situation
In Italy , students have to decide between grammar schools and technical institutes as their secondary school type .
Most people think that choosing a grammar school is the best option , because it opens the door to university , while technical institutes are put in a corner .
That is actually a mistake , because the schools who best prepare students to working life are technical institutes , who emphasize the real world applications of the studied subjects through laboratories and industry experiences .
Conversely , grammar schools extremely focus on theory .
In fact , students learn lots of formulas and principles without actually linking them with one another in order to use them in real life .
I think that problem should be addressed .
Suggestions
What I would suggest in order to deal with this problem is to integrate more laboratory experiences also in grammar schools , like chemistry experiments or bacteria observation with microscopes .
Furthermore , schools should offer a year in industry for students in the last two years , which would not only teach them a lot more than school only would , but it would also attract more people to the school itself .
Conclusion
People should get used to the fact that most companies will also care about your previous work experience , and the idea of gaining that through school would be really appealing .
Dear Sir or Madam ,

Subjects that should be taught at school .
Nobody can argue with the fact that education is a relevant period in the development of a child .
Learning new languages is very important , but also studying subjects related to computers and technology like computer programming is becoming more and more useful than ancient languages like Greek or Latin .
This is because technology has become a relevant tool for work and study in particular and an important instrument in life in general .
It is quite evident that learning ancient languages today is not as relevant as it is used to be in the past .
On one hand , it allows the students to understand and translate ancient texts and helps them to learn about cultures from the past .
On the other hand , this does not bring too many employment opportunities .
Recent surveys proved that the study of these languages does not add much to the students future success .
Related to learning computer programming , it guarantees a good living .
It is a known fact that there are very few computer programmers .
Furthermore as technology changes more and more , there will be a greater demand of these skills in the future .
It is evident that technology is in every aspect of our lives .
In conclusion , there are a lot of subjects that might be taught at school , but there is no doubt that Computer Programming should be included as a highlighted subject in the syllabus of any school serious programme .
Okay , so I 'm going to talk about One Direction .
I consider them as my favorite band since 2010 , because I had the chance to get to meet them watching The X Factor 's episode where they auditioned .
When I was in middle - school , back in 2011 , I noticed that they had already released their first single called What Makes You Beautiful , so I listened to it and obviously fell in love with it , and with their first album too , named Up All Night .
When they dropped their second album , I was so excited about it and I waited like 2 hours on the line of a music shop to get it . Years passed by , and I was still a fan of them , as I am now .
I have been following them almost 6 years in a row !
I ca n't wait for them to go back to all the stages and arenas to sing , because I 'm going to their 2017 or 2018 tour no matter what , as I did back in 2012 and 2015 .
Groban : All that echoes
' All that echoes ' , by Josh Groban , is the sixth studio album of this American singer and songwriter .
It contains twelve tracks to enjoy that you wait impatiently for the next song .
That fascinating album surprises not only the variety of subjects but also the strength of instrumental sounds .
The first single , ' Brave ' , is a chart - topping song about emotions such as fear and fight .
The arrangements are simple and effective and the powerful voice plays harmoniously with the rich sound .
It is bound to be at the top of my list .
False alarm , which is the second track , is totally different and mysterious because of wealth of musical instruments .
Groban sings well - known from the film ' Once " song called ' Falling slowly ' in his own fantastic way but listeners get used to the first version might be disappointed .
Musically satisfying ' Happy in my heartache ' tells the story of tragic love .
Once again , Groban fascinates audiences from all over the world with his mature voice and catchy tunes .
I definitely recommend that album to your collection .
It 's a must !
Once upon a time , in a large town there lived a young man who worked at a post office .
His main task was to collect letters from abroad and to hand them to THE postmen WHO WERE in charge of DELIVERING them to THE addressees .
Thus , every day he had a chance to see where the letters came from .
He DEVELOPED AN INTEREST in FOREIGN COUNTRIES .
Besides , he also came to being keen on learning foreign languages so much so that he decided to enroll on courses of French and German .
He became HIGHLY skilled at writing in these languages and this ability turned OUT to be useful in his job .
One day , he took part in a competition intended for the selection of the head of the post office where he was still working .
The LARGE NUMBER OF participants DID VARIOUS EXERCISES , INCLUDING a TRANSLATION into German .
When the exam was finished , he went out the room where the competition had been held .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
The reason I am writing to you is poor quality of a food processor , which I bought in your store two weeks ago .
After using two times , problems started to appear .
I noticed that the first malfunction was safety lock which demanded applying of great force .
My wife had to ask me for help , because she was n't strong enough to push the safety lock through .
We discovered that another problem when tried to use the blender .
I put some ice cream and milk in the blender and pushed the " start " button .
It started working but suddenly got stuck and we were unable to use it since .
I was very surprised to discover that many problems in a quite expensive model .
Naturally , I returned the blender to you to be replaced with a new one .
Your assistant said that I would have to wait only a week .
After two weeks the food processor had still not arrived .
Finally , four weeks later , I was contacted by your representative .
Imagine my feelings when I learned from him that I ca n't receive the same model of food processor as I bought .
As a solution he offered that upgrade my model to a better and this too will take two weeks .
I am very disappointed with both the equipment and the service have I received .
Therefore , I expect refunding my full amount $ 180 as soon as possible .
Yours faithfully ,
Smith
Dear Mr Cunningham ,
I am writing to apply for the post of camp monitor which I saw advertised on the university website .
I am very interested in it because I would like to broaden my experience in activities with children .
Not only do I have a big nuclear family who is made up by four siblings , but I also have a big extended family .
Besides as I am the eldest brother , I am used to dealing with children .
Regarding my experience , on the one hand , I take part in a soccer club in university , consequently , I have some experience working in a team .
On the other hand , I have just finished my first year in Physical Education degree , where we played a lot of different sports .
It is true , that water sports are not the most usual there , however , I enjoy practising them every summer on the beach .
Although I am Spanish and English is not my first language , I can speak fluently because my mother is Irish and she always used to speak English to us .
I feel I would be the person you are looking for because I am patient and alert .
These are the most important skills when you deal with children , due to de fact that you ought to keep on the lookout for their behaviour .
Moreover , from my point of view , children need to focus their attention in a constant activity , my sense of humour and creativity allow me to change activities quickly in order to maintain their attention .
If you offer me the chance to join your team , you shall not be disappointed .
I would appreciate a reply at your earliest convenience .
Please contact me regarding any queries you may have .
Yours sincerely ,
Those days , travelling by car is becoming more popular among urban people .
This kind of transport is regarded as a covenient way .
Government build more roads and more families are able to afford cars .
As a result , some people hold the opinion that in the future , there will be no public transport .
However , I disgree with this idea .
Instead , I suppose that public transport will play an essential part in future life .
There are three advantages of public transport over private cars that I want to explain .
On one hand , it is enviornmentally friendly to use public transport rather than cars .
Nowadays , buses using electronic power instead of petrol have appeared in urban cities .
They produce no gas to the air , leading to little air pollution .
In the meanwhile , if people prefer to take buses or subways , there will be less noises in the street .
On the other hand , buses and subways can accommodate more passengers while a car can only contains 4 to 5 people totally .
Compared with cars , public transport has larger capability of conveying , which saves space and costs less .
Last but not least , fewer car accidents will happen if people choose to use public transport so traffic jams will be avoided especially in rush hours .
Thus , it will be more smooth and pleasant for passengers to travel on the road .
In conclusion , public transport is a cost - effective way for people to travel , which also contributes to the sustainable development of society .
" Educational institutions have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing fields of study in which they are unlikely to succeed . "
The statement claims that the educational institutions are responsible for convincing students not to put too much effort on fields or subjects that they are not good at , which I can not agree with .
This statement fails to consider the main function of education , which is not training superstars or perfect robots but teaching students how to face and solve the problems they are confronted instead of escape .
The responsibility of education institutions should be helping and guiding students to make their own decisions , not making decisions for students .
Among various purposes of education , in my opinions , the most important one is teaching students to solve problems .
Confronting the challenging instead of turning aside , trying to think of possible solutions instead of giving up at the beginning , always being positive to unknown instead of negative and retreating , all these are the main reason why the humankinds can keep improving .
Transferring these knowledge and experiences to young people is the meaning of education .
If the educational institutions always stopped students from trying just because they have less chance to be successful , we 'll never have people such as Thomas Edison or Albert Einstein , who were considered as stupid kids in school but did n't give up trying .
Convincing students to take a more comfortable road by giving up the possible risk is definitely not the proper attitude the educational institution should have .
One may suggest that everyone need to learn to assess the risk before invest , however , teaching students how to assess not assessing for students is the responsibility of educational institutions .
Truly that knowing one 's limit is the first step of bringing out the maximum value of one 's talent .
It 's not smart to encourage people doing what exceed their ability .
Nevertheless , the ability of identifying limit of oneself can be best learned from experiences .
One would never know he / she can swim or not without jumping into the swimming pool .
The responsibility of the educational institutions is to make sure that he / she wo n't be in danger in the swimming pool instead of dissuading him / her from getting close to the water .
Educational institutions should guide students to have better self - understanding and self - assessing , not persuading them to follow the pre - decided road .
Last but not least , what is the definition of " success " ?
How do the educational institutions judge a student being likely to succeed or not ?
What if a student would rather to do something he / she likes instead of he / she is good at ?
Not everyone is living for the kind of success which most people agree with , such as wealthy , fame or power .
For some people , living a life which enable them do what they like and like what they are doing is enough to be considered as a successful life .
They might not be the top , but they are self - actualized and satisfied , and only in such situation they can provide most to the world , just like Albert Einstein has said , " Try not to become a man of success but rather to become a man of value . "
Considering all the above , I can not agree with the statement that persuading students not to pursue field of study in which they have less possibility to be successful is the responsibility of the educational institutions .
In my opinions , the purpose of the education is to teach and guide students how to facing the problems and making their own decision properly , not force them to accept what have already been arranged for them .
Contribution
The most popular TV programme in Germany is definitely the news programme " Tagesschau " which is airing about three times a day on the channel " Das Erste / ARD " .
It is a news programme based on well researched facts and offers a wide range of all the important information you need .
Every now and then they even air an extra reportage on a certain field like the European election or the crisis in the Ukraine .
The main reason for its popularity is its accuracy and funded research which makes it more reliable than other news programmes .
Moreover they try to be interesting for all ages so they post on facebook and twitter as well which draws the attention of the younger generation to the programme .
Nevertheless they always inform about the latest news on their website and in their TV show as soon as possible and in addition they give a great overview of the necessary background information you need .
In my personal opinion I strongly believe that this TV programme earns its popularity .
The way they present themselves in the media and the well funded research are truly unique in German news programmes .
Although I am rarely watching the show on TV I like the way they are trying to keep up with modern technology and that they are always making boring nes so vivid interesting through short video clips , pictures and their choice of words .
If you ever get to watch TV in Germany you should definitely try out this interesting news programme .
Dear Emma ,
I was so glad to read your letter about your new job .
How is it ?
Have you got friendly colleagues ?
Do you get along with your superior ?
Last summer I finally managed to change my boring job and that tiny clothes job for a better one .
I worked at the local cinema where Fred was also working .
It was amazing !
We 'd get there at about half past eight every day and started cleaning the main room and proceeding with the smaller rooms in the cinema .
It was a lot of fun mainly because it was just us two .
We 'd make jokes and chase each other with the brooms , trying to smack the other on the head .
The main advantage of working at the local cinema was the free popcorn and getting to enjoy the newest films .
We got to see the new Bond movie and also the blockbuster Spiderman 3 there .
My job was cleaning the cinema , but Fred 's main responsibility was to roll the movies for the clients , so I 'd make sure I finished cleaning earlier , so I could enjoy watching movies with him .
But enough about me ! Tell me about you !
Have you finally asked Mark out ?
I ca n't wait for you to answer .
I 'll write soon !
Love ,
For last ten years Michael had been working in a well - known company in London as an accountant .
He did like his job but as we all know , sometimes people suddenly feel they have to change something .
They do n't know exactly what they should do , what to change - buy a new pair of shoes or maybe do something more - move to a different city or even to a foreign country .
Michael had exactly the same problem .
One day he woke up much earlier than used to .
He prepared a coffee for himself and turned the TV on to watch the news .
He sat on a sofa in front of a television and suddenly he realised the fact that every morning was exactly the same , nothing has changed since such many years ! "
I wo n't stand it any longer " - he thought .
But what to do ?
A crazy idea came to his mind .
Since Michael was a child he has always dreamt of moving to Australia , where he could practise kitesurfing for all day long , meet open - minded people , chill on a sandy beach and drink a good Australian alcohol .
" Why should n't I give myself a chance to make my dreams come true ?
People have only one life , not more ! "
At that moment he was pretty sure what to do now .
He took a sheet of paper and a pen and started to write .
After 10 minutes a resignation letter was ready to bring it to Michael 's boss .
He arrived on the company as quickly as the crowded London 's streets allowed him .
" I need to talk to boss " - he said to Jane , the main secretary of the company .
Without waiting for her answer , he just went into the office , gave to Mike , his boss for 10 years , an envelope with a resignation letter and left .
It all took about 3 minutes .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Sometimes we do things we do n't want for no apparent reason but some other times we know exactly where we are getting into .
Michael had cheated on her and he did it consciously .
There was no way to shine a different light to that fact .
He tried in his mind to go back to that moment , when his lips were getting closer to Jane , to that last look before the embrace , to the previous smile .
There was no one else to blame but him .
Regret had been filling up his soul since last Friday .
He could not keep his betrayal inside any longer so he entered the living room and told her .
The words coming up from his mouth like a litany , almost mechanically as he realized that there was no turning back .
Tears ran down Rachel 's face .
No words , not a single comment .
She just stood up , took her purse , and left .
The relieve of telling her was instantly replaced by a bitter hollowness .
He now realized .
He did n't do it for her , he only did it for himself , to get rid of his burden but it was far too late .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
The Beautiful Game
Glitz , glamour and popularity ; three words which are often linked to the world of football and this sport in no doubt one of the finest that man has created .
The stars playing this game add to the already amassed recognition of the sport .
Weekends would be a drag if match days were not on television .
The 90 minutes is the most enjoyed time of the week though because of the adrenalin rush that is associated with every thing that is done on the pitch .
As a fan supporting a team is just one part of the sport .
Rivalries , arguments on which team is the better team and watching matches in a group just adds to the excitement .
These are just some of the many things that make me love this sport so much .
In the 21st century , advice is something that is only given and that given advice is never taken .
With regard to this sport any advice in my opinion is a good advice and I have just a single advice for a person starting this sport and that advice would be to enjoy everything related to the sport .
Nowadays students need to learn both language and mathematics until go to university , even some of them still need to study them in the university .
A large number of examples prove that some of them are good at language whereas others are skilled in mathematics .
This essay will discuss the differences and similarities for learning a language and learning mathematics .
The ways of learning a language and mathematics are different .
For studying a language , people need to communicate with others to improve their speaking and listening levels and read variety of overseas book to increase their reading and writing skills .
Furthermore , people need to have a good memory to remember a large number of words .
In general , studying a language focuses more on a large account of individual effort and little talent .
However , for learning mathematics , students need to listen carefully in the class and find some rules to solve questions . Instead of rote learning , they should remember different types of formulas by practicing in a mass of examples .
To sum up , teachers , skills and talent are more important for learning mathematics .
However , there are some similarities for those two subjects .
Firstly , both those courses need to do a mass of practices , even the ways are different .
People need to spend a huge account of time on doing exercise after class .
Secondly , associability is important for both languages and mathematics .
For example , when people learn a new word or a formula , they need to think about how to use it in real sentence or exercises .
In conclusion , people need to find a right way which can save much time and energy to study these two subjects .
It is the most important thing that they should think about carefully before they start their study .
Shenzhen - China 's largest migrant city and a neighbor of Hong Kong - is a remarkable place that I call home .
Most Shenzhen residents come from different cultural backgrounds and speak various regional dialects .
Meanwhile , we embrace a superordinate Shenzhen identity , which is characterized by a culture of openness , tolerance , and creativity .
Our differences , it seems , do not make a difference .
However , the young I soon discovered that some dimensions of difference do carry social significance .
As a child who did not play with " boys ' toys " and identified as gay later , I was often subjected to disdain and hostility from peers and adults .
Ironically , the marginalization comes not only from society at large , but also from within the gay community .
A feminine gay man is considered as lesser than his masculine counterpart , because femininity is regarded as weak , unattractive , and second - class .
This experience of amplified minority stress prompted me to think about intergroup and intragroup interaction early in life .
It has led me to believe that masculinity should not be an indicator of individual worth .
Nor should sexuality , skin color , and other identity markers - whether visible or invisible .
Anna knew that was going to be a very special day for her .
That morning she woke up in a very good mood .
It was the day of her birthday , so she decided to go out with friends .
She chose little , cosy restaurant near her house .
She did not suspect that it will be such a wonderful evening .
As soon as Anna and her friends came into restaurant everything started to go perfect .
Then all got special clothes and dressed up in colourful , old - fashined dresses .
The moment the door opened was the most exciting in Anna 's life .
She jumped for joy .
She said to friends : ' This is best party ever !
Thank you so much ! ' .
She started to dance with double Presley , laugh and appreciate every single minute .
As it turned out later , to Anna 's surprise , it was her boyfriend dressed as Presley .
She was embarrassed that she did not recognise him .
But immediately she realize that it was one of her friends ' tricky plan and she started to laugh with them .
After a few exciting hours of the party she said thank you to her friends and boyfriend and promised she will never forget what they did for her .
She went to sleep with belief that she is the happiest girl in the world .
The Alhambra
The Alhambra is a beautiful palace which is situated in Granada , in the south of Spain .
Its historical importance lies in the fact that this place represents the fall of the Muslim kinddom in my country .
The Catholic Monarchs , Isabella and Ferdinad , had tried for several years to defeat the muslims , who at this time , only remained seated in the city of Granada .
The Alhambra Palace was the residence of Boabdil , the last Muslim king , who was defeated in 1492 after delivering Granada to the Catholic Monarchs .
Nowadays , this palace is one of the most visited places here in Spain because of its beauty and its impressive courtyards .
You can see the history of the Reconquets in its walls and towers .
Its surroundings are also wonderful , and the city invites you to spend more time in the Alhambra , one of the last Muslim palaces in the word .
Hi Paul ,
How are you doing ?
I haven't seen you for almost two months but , as you know , on November I had a one of a kind possibility to help at a concert that took place on airport runway and it was simply amazing experience !
I 'm sure you do know that I 'm obsessed with rock music and that is why I could n't miss the boat .
An event started at 7 p.m. but all the volunteers who had signed a contract had to work from 8 a.m. Everything has to be perfect during such events so we had no time to relax or even eat a decent meal !
The whole process of selling the tickets was fascinating because of the demand for them .
People looked like aggressive monsters and I realised that they are close to kill their every single ' rival ' .
Security guards had a lot of work to do but thanks to them we stand a chance to deal with other problems , as for example regulating the quality of sound .
I was incredibly overjoyed when the culmination came .
A band was playing , we were enjoying music and it seemed that there will be no more complications .
What you actually think in such an extraordinary moment is that life could n't be more beautiful .
Take care , Paul .
When you come to my town , we 'll go out to a rock concert together ! Ca n't wait !
Warm regards
Adam
Hi Paul ,
just a quick answer to your request .
I do n't have much time , because I 'm taking off in 10 minutes to help at another concert .
So , the deal is , I met this guy in the bar , Ron , and we started talking .
After a few drinks I told him that I 'm currenly looking for a job , nothing big , just a couple of hours during weekends to gather some money for my journey to Netherlands .
Remember , I told you about it last time , when we met Jenny .
Anyway , it turned out that the guy works in this agency , they organise concerts , parties and stuff like that , and he offered me the job !
The perfect one !
It 's literally 10 - 15 hours on Fridays nights and Saturdays , stuff like carrying instruments ( which means hanging out with musicians ) , tyding after ( finding things , like wallets and cellphones ) and generally speaking - helping .
Last week I worked most time with the manager of The Kooks .
I went to Krakow and spent all day " planning " their stay in Poland .
In fact I had to be everywhere with the guy , just hanging and helping him not to get lost in the city .
He 's a really nice guy , during the concert we had a few drinks , smoked some fags together .
I tell you , I meet so many people nowadays that I do n't even remember their names .
The salary is nice too .
Usually I get 12 PLN per hour ( yeah , I know , It 's like 2,50 pounds , but here it 's quite good ) but sometimes I get some extra money for staying after hours or when I do something unusual to help .
Last time it was for example delivering my drunk boss home ;)
I have to go now .
Take care and call me on Skype tomorrow - I 'll tell you so much more , I have plenty of unbelievable stories !
Cheers ,
Arek
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
He said to himself : What have I done ?
Why have I killed him ?
I 'm a chemist I ca n't kill people becasue I wanted to .
He had to take the man 's body and hide it somewhere .
The police was gon na come in any time .
He grabbed the body and put it on the car 's trunk .
He went to his lab and showed his partner the dead body .
His partner said : Man , we have to do something and quick .
They grabbed the body and soaked him on fuel .
Then they went to the dead man 's car and put him in there .
Later , when they were sure that there were no one near they burned the car .
The killers partner felt guilty for a moment but then the killer told him : ' He earned it .
He tried to kill me after killing lots of other people . '
Saddly the police found out that it was them .
Thanks that the judge 's best friend had been killed by the man the chemist killed so they went out free and without bad feeling .
A modern interpretation of Austen 's Classic Love Story
The glorious world of Jane Austen is brought back to the silver screen in Pride & Prejudice , a 2005 British film based on the novel of the same title , published in 1813 .
Joe Wright directs this uplifting adaptation , which depicts the five Bennet sisters , who have been brought up to get married .
The enthusiastic and clever Elizabeth stands out among them striving to put everything in a broader perspective .
However , their whole lives will be turned upside down when an elegible bachelor and his friends set up home in a close mansion .
Surprisingly enough , sparks fly when spirited Elizabeth Bennet ( Keira Knightley ) meets single , rich , and proud Mr. Darcy ( Matthew Macfadyen ) .
All in all , will each one be able to overcome their own pride and prejudice ?
Keira Knightley , in the lead role of Elizabeth Bennet , delivers an outstanding performance .
In fact , the film , well cast from top to bottom , is highlighted by a compelling soundtrack and a set of beautiful English locations , as in many British productions .
In this adaptation , the screenwriter makes some substantial alterations to the novel .
Therefore dialogues , settings as well as politeness , costumes and hairstyles are meant to give it greater public appeal , sacrificing historical accuracy .
Thus , overlapping dialogues are introduced in a mixture of modern idiom and archaic sentence structure , several scenes have been shifted to more romantic settings , and the proximity of the Bennets to their rural life is stressed to illustrate their relative poverty in contrast with the rich characters of the story
To conclude , Pride & Prejudice is an amazing adaptation which completely bewitches you with an exquisite blend of emotion and wit .
In fact , in its final minutes , it makes you believe , for one misty - eyed moment , in true love and in order reigning in the universe .
By the way , if you haven't seen this romantic , funny , well - acted and well - scripted film yet ; give it a try !
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am writing in order to apply for the position in your Film Club for students of English .
I am 45 years old man and I have plenty of experience in working with people .
I used to work with young people in primary and secondary schools teaching Spanish language .
Although I still have not passed the FCE exam I am currently working hard to fulfil the goal very soon .
Above all I am interested in films .
Science fiction are my favourite type of films because I like to leave behind normal life nevertheless , I enjoy all kinds of them such as comedies , thrillers , westerns , horror films and even silent films .
I think I am right for the position because I think I can boost the motivation of the people about movies and push them up to share their particular point of view .
As far as the job is concern working on Monday and Wednesday evening would be perfect for me because I am currently unemployed .
Please feel free to ask for further information if you need it .

Dear James ,
Thank you for accepting our invitation to give a talk at our club .
Our club members are thrilled knowing that an international sports star like you is coming to see them .
In reference to the speech date , the best would be June 12 in the evening , when all the members will have finished their classes at school .
The children are aged between ten and sixteen and they enjoy playing football and swimming .
I 'm sure we 'll all enjoy your speech .
What about talking about fair play at sport and how to become a sports star ?
We believe that fair play is a very important topic because children must learn to behave properly when playing a sport .
Also , we think that becoming a sports star is difficult and it would be a good idea to talk about it because some of the club members wrongly think it is easy to succeed playing a sport .
Looking forward to seeing you on 12 June .
Kind regards ,
John
I love to write .
It is a method I use to relax , unwind and revive myself .
Our mind is always full of thoughts .
Some of these thoughts make us smile , some frown .
But all these are addressed through writing .
Writing should be done naturally ; only then it serves its real purpose .
I have written many poems , few articles and even a few stories .
It is certainly a pleasure to write and also reading what I have written , after a long time .
Many times reading my own poems and articles is a surprising experience . "
Am I the same person who wrote this ?
" I ask myself , wondering how did I come up with some ideas and words that seem just so good and uncommon right now .
Other than myself , I have had few people reading what I have written ; very few , I must say ; maybe only 2 or 3 ; and they were not critics or experts .
So , I have yet to submit myself to some serious criticism ( well , calling my writings literature is a huge joke in itself ... anyway ) ; but yes , I would like to place my written works ( however small and few they may be)for qualitative discussions in front of people who really can identify the good and the ' not - so - good ' writing .
I would like getting good advice about how can I make myself a better writer .
Let 's see when and how that happens ... !
It 's very common to hear people talking about friendship , but are we sure about the real meaning of it ?
Do we know what does it mean to be a friend ?
Firstly we ought to consider that friendship is not uniquely a human emotion .
Friendship is overall an acto of will .
Friendship is a type of love which is characterized by being incondicional , reciprocal , and ready to forgive each other .
A friend is a treasure , as the title of that adventure - comedy film , somebody you can share your problems with .
Somebody who listens to you talking about your dreams and wishes , your expectations and your efforts and sacrifices to get them , your plans for the future , and moreover pays special attention on times of crisis .
This is why the members of my family are my best friends .
My family loves me whatever I think or whatever I do , no matter if it is correct or not .
They love me just because I am me , for who I am .
They are always going to tell me the truth although this truth could hurt me , because they always want me to be happy .
Finally , they warn me of danger but they let me do , even if in the end I 'd make a big mistake . They 'd keep always close to me and neither would fail .
They feel happy when I am happy , they are sad when I am sad , they enjoy themselves with my success .
They are , definitely , my best friends .
The painting is an amazing one and one should definitely take a look at it in order to appreciate its full beauty .
The Mona Lisa is perhaps Leonardo DaVinci 's most famous of paintings .
It is an oil painting , painted on poplar wood .
The painting is most famous for the smile of the woman , which people have been trying to decipher for a long time .
Many believe that the portrait is that of DaVinci himself , while many also place a lot mystic connections with this painting .
The portrait depicts a woman 's bust , with a distant landscape that is visible in the backdrop .
Leonardo used a pyramid design to install the woman in a simple and calm manner within the painting .
The woman is shown with her hands folded , with her breast , neck , and face painted the same color as her hands .
The light is diffused so that the various curves and geometrical shapes on the painting are made visible through it .
Perhaps the most interesting thing about the painting is the woman 's smile .
Many believe that it is innocent and inviting , while others believe it is that of smugness and is a smirk .
Many scientific studies have been undertaken to determine the exact nature of the smile and the real reason remains a mystery .
It is believed that every person sees the smile differently because of the changes in the lighting that Leonardo presented .
The woman is shown seated in an open area , and behind her is a vast landscape , which recedes to an icy mountain .
Some winding paths and a far away bridge is also perceptible in the background .
The painting is an amazing one and one should definitely take a look at it in order to appreciate its full beauty .
The painting is currently on display at the Musee du Louvre , in Paris .
Over the past few years , the Internet has become an important part of our lives .
We use it to communicate with friends , to play games , to watch series , the list is endless .
Unfortunately , it is not perfect .
Because the more people use the Internet , the greater the chances are of people misusing it .
Luckily , the government intervenes to preserve the safety of the Internet .
What it comes down to is , should the Internet be more tightly controlled by governments ?
Without the interference of the government , criminals may see their chances to take advantage of internet users .
They could get into our computers and steal our information .
They could use that information to get into our bank accounts and steal our money .
However , if the government were to monitor the citizens actions more closely , it would be considered an invasion of our privacy .
Nobody wants to have their private data to be exposed to the eyes of the government .
This brings me to the next issue .
The reason why the government even take action is to ensure people are able to enjoy the internet , but a more tightly controlled internet would destroy that purpose .
Everybody likes to have the freedom to explore the internet .
So they would not appreciate it if there were suddenly restrictions put on them .
To sum things up , the government should not control the internet more tightly .
It is fine the way it is right now .
That way , the most of the trouble would be kept away from the internet while at the same time , the internet users would still have the freedom to explore the web .
Are people born violent or do they become violent because of how they are brought up ?
How did we become the person we are ?
Is there something that makes us unique ?
Is it the genes we are born with ?
Or are we a product of our own lives ?
It is clear that genes play a very important part in the person we are .
Family characteristics such as eye and hair colour are inherited by children from their parents as well as some diseases and mental disorders .
Therefore , what we need to consider is whether our personality and personal skills are born or made .
Those who hold that nature has a stronger influence than nurture on developing our personal identity will claim that certain personality traits are also determined by our genes .
Nevertheless , identical twins that were separated when they were very young and have been raised in different environments show differences in their personalities .
This provides evidence that life experiences and surrounding where you grow up have defined the kind of person you are today .
Regarding personal skills , there are a large number of cases in which children were born gifted for the same field as their parents having great potential for a specific art or science since early childhood .
However , nature does n't always endow us with inborn abilities .
For instance , parents tend to instil their own passions in their children and , consequently , they will likely be interested in the same academic or artistic field .
According to this fact , parents often shape their children 's lives encouraging them to follow in their footsteps .
Likewise , some people put their success in life down more to their parent 's training than to their innate talents .
So , to conclude we would have to argue that both nature and nurture make us who we are .
As I see it , personal identity is the result of the interaction of our genetic structure and the environment which surrounds us .
The problem is how to separate these two influences and how to find out which the strongest is in each case .
Dear Ira !
Thanks a lot for your letter .
It was fun to read as always .
Your new friends seem to be crazy guys , in a good way , of course .
I was so surprised to hear you signed up for a new interior design course because it 's such a coincidence that I 'm planning to do something with my bedroom in the near future .
As I 've got some extra money at last , I think It 's high time for me to think how to make it cozy and comfortable .
I hope you do n't mind if I ask you some questions .
First , I think about painting the walls in warm colors ( apricot , salmon or warm beige ) . I thought you might add some more interesting colors to the list .
Do you think a wall mural is a good decision for the bedroom and what other « special effects » would you recommend ?
I completely rely on your taste as we 've always been on the same wavelength .
Now , the toughest questions . I 've got no clue what to do with the ceiling .
The idea of painting it white seems too boring to me and I 'm completely out of my depth with all this new stuff for ceilings in shops , but I 'm sure you 're an expert !
The floor is also a problem .
I want it to look beautiful , be easy to wash and not expensive at the same time .
I 'm wondering what you would suggest .
I hope I do n't bother you too much with my redecoration , knowing how busy you are .
Ca n't wait to hear what you 've been up to this weekend .
All the best
Natasha
CONVENIENCE IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT
Nowadays , every one of us travels a lot .
We do that for work or to finally get a rest .
I , as a young women , usually travel just as a hobby .
Since the technology has improved in recent years , we now have a huge variety of different ways to travel .
Is it possible to choose which one is the best ?
The most common answer would be probably the plane .
There are so many advantages .
It is the fastest and the most comfortable one .
Of course , for these facilities you have to pay a lot of money and that could be a problem for some people .
The next one is boat .
It could also be really comfortable but we do n't use it often .
It 's more for exotic trips .
Travelling on a boat for sure is a great adventure .
But there is also an inconvenience - it is also expensive .
And it is hard to plan a trip like this .
What about the train then ?
This is the best option for me .
In my country trains are n't really fast and there could be problems during the trip but that 's for me makes it more interesting .
During the trip you can do many things - from sleeping to meeting new people and making fun .
It is also quite safe so you do n't have to worry about the accidents .
I wish I could travel every day .
The trip is an adventure and the ways you can travel are a big part of it .
Even though any mode of transportation is not bad , for me the train is the best option .
back in 2010 , I traveled from Porto Alegre to Sao Paulo by car , a course that took 18 hours driving straight , surely very few people would consider it convenient .
cars are handy and driving can be pleasant , but only when the driver is in good mood , with no traffic jams or craters on the road ( really common situations in Brazil ) .
Since ancient times exist public transport , and it suffered numerous attempts of assassination , in China for example , the dynasty Yuan prohibited public transport ( at that age , charriots ) because of fear that Han people could plot and riot against mongol 's dictatorship in it ; the situation inverted at early socialist regime when , in 1960 , Mao considered personal cars as instrument of opression and symbol of devilish capitalism .
Of course , none of these radical measures last long against the very basic human instinct : laziness .
we have cars so we do n't have to walk , in the same fashion , people who ca n't afford a car will want public transport , even if a bike could be the solution .
The convenience has litlle to do with the fate of public transport , countries with high HDI(convenience to be drivers ) , like Germany and England , are those with better public transport system , and they are even boosting it .
Unless some extraordinary mutation happens and change us to some labor - lovers , personal cars and public transport will rule side by side for all eternity .

Hi ! My name is Alexia , I am twenty - three years old and I live in Argetina .

I have been learning English for a while , I am sensitive and positive person , full of energy and willing to have new adventures .

If you get to hire me you wouln't regret it .
Yours Faithfully , Alexia .
The diagrams vividly show us the process of making banking notes .
The process can be divided into three sections .
Above all , it 's a significant step to make a good design , in which background colour , artwork and security are the main considerations .
Then it comes to the preparation of metal plates and that needs skilled machinists .
Only after all the work above is completed , can printing step be carried out .
The second section is printing .
Each sheet contains 50 bank notes .
There may be several colours on both sides of bank notes .
To make sure of the printing effect , special ink has to be used .
Besides , The images can be slightly raised .
After printing , there is much more work to be done .
The most important step is inspection manually .
After that , good quality sheets and bank notes separated from partially damaged sheets will be packaged and distributed .
Bad sheets and bank notes will be securely destroed .
Introduction :
The aim of this report is to give some information about the range of exciting activities that people can do in our area .
Water sports :
There are lots of places where you can do water sports like scuba diving , windsurfing , surfing , go on a banana bus , kayaking … The Costa Brava is the perfect place to do water sports because there is a lot of wind and good weather .
Winter sports :
In winter you can go skiing or snowboarding in the Pirineus .
There are near to France and Andorra .
There are lots of ski stations with good ski slopes of different levels with different colours , the greens are the easiest and blacks are the most difficult .
Montmeló :
In Catalonia there is an important race track where the cars of Formula 1 race .
When there is n't any race you can go and try different racing cars or if you want you can go and race a bike on the race track .
Conclusion :
To sum up I think that if you want to do exciting sports Catalonia is a good place where you can find lots of different sports and you can choose what to do , but if you do n't want to do sports you can do another activities or go on interesting places .
Michael had already woken up when his mother 's alarm clock started ringing .
He got up as quietly as he could and waited until he stopped hearing his mother talking to herself , which meant she had headed to the kitchen .
Michael knew his mother had planned on baking a cake .
He hid near the door , where he could watch for a chance to try the cream without being noticed .
He waited for what seemed like an eternity until he saw her leaving the kitchen with Michael 's father 's breakfast .
It was his chance .
' I must keep an eye on the door ' he muttered as he entered . '
If she finds out I was here , she 'll kill me ' .
Michael tried the cream and thought that her mother would n't notice it if he ate another bit . '
After all , what I had was so infinitesimal that I could barely taste it . '
Before he could notice , the cream was all gone .
It was time to escape , even though his mother would find out who ate it eventually .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Chapter 9 : The KM-3J : The second confrontation
That night the time flew by , but things started to get weird , Marcus was talking with an Australian guy about the proofs that he had found related to dinosaurs , he was interested in them , but Marcus did n't like his point of view about those species , the guy told him they were bad creatures with no feelings , and Marcus thought they were awesome and the most lovely creatures he had never heard about , the guy thought Marcus was crazy , so he flew from the Federal Palace .
Meanwhile , Mark and Michael were talking with Russian ladies , they were beautiful and flawless , the scientists started talking about science and that sort of thing , and suddenly the ladies vanished , the men started crying .
Jack , was arguing with an officer about Mexico conquest ( the officer did n't understand anything because Jack was drunk ) , and suddenly , the officer took off his costume and a strange mask , and in that moment … Jack was astonished because the officer was not an officer , he was Brad !
Jack tried to confront him , but as soon as he tried to do that , he snapped his fingers and a lot of people came around him , he had a new team , he decided to name them " The KM-3J " , a villains team , their names were Karolina ( she decided to change his name like that because he used to say that that letter was her favorite one ) , Melanie , Miley ( they were both twins , the most beautiful ladies of the world ) , Max , who was an expert in the military field , and Brad Rowley J. , nobody had known his last name until that moment : Junior , he was embarrassed about it , he was descendant of a weird woman , however she was her mother .
The KM-3J put Jack into an immense bag , they were planning to kill him and place his dead body in a grave , in that way their friends would find him buried , but they were not that evil , they just put him into a dark room and tied his hands in a chair , it was exactly the same thing he was dreamed about .
While Jack was there , he heard Brad talking with Max about their new plan , it was related to a gigantic weapon that would shoot toxic wastes at New York city , so in that way , everybody would become a zombie .
The bulk of the population from New York was homeless because there has just been a horrible war between New York City and California , however , increasingly refined body technologies allowed New York to win the war .
Jack was frightened , but suddenly he heard the door opening and saw their friends rescuing him , they had used some weapons from The King of the Sky , they got into the room and started shooting while Michael was unleashing Jack from the chair , accidentally , Mark killed Miley while he was shooting , all her body parts were scattered on the floor , he did n't care about and flew with the others .
Jack fainted while their friends were rescuing him .
When they arrived at mainland , Jack woke up , there was n't anyone around him , there was just sand and the beach …
Comfort , time and internal peace are required to make learning efficient .
Hence , it is not possible to do job and study side by side .
Occupation and education disturb one another .
I strongly oppose this statement because handling both these together is easily possible with strong willpower .
I will elaborate points to support my opinion in the further paragraphs .
Firstly , there are a lot of people in western countries , who do a part - time study and work full - time or vice - versa .
It all depends on the preference of the individuals .
If they want to bear some hassle and become more productive in their life , they can manage both things side by side .
This not only makes them knowledgeable but increase their potential as well .
Secondly , there are a few parents who can not bear the expenses of their child 's education .
Resultantly , they put their children into some labor so that they can earn money for the family .
But it does not mean that the child has to abandon his dream of acquiring education .
With firm determination , they can continue their education and work to feed their family as well .
Finally , sometimes people think they have completed their education , but when they get a full - time job , they realize that diploma or degree can increase their chances of promotion .
Moreover , some employers select the potential employee from colleges while they are studying and pay for their Masters or Advanced Diplomas because they see their profit in that investment .
Hence , studying and working side by side helps candidates to grow professionally .
In conclusion , working and studying is very much possible .
It just depends on the dedication and determination of the person .
People should do both study and work side by side to make themselves more skilled and capable .

How did this happen ?
How can I be here at D'el Arte wearing a suit and tie with my beautiful wife ?
The day had n't been planned to end with a date night .
Then it all dawned on me .
I 'd been set up .
Duped , so to say , into this unlikely event , a date night .
Her plan was so clever and deceptive as to escape detection until the last card had been played .
Oh , my wife is clever .
When exactly did the deception begin ?
Was it the party which lasted until 3 am the night before ?
Was it at the invitation to the wedding three weeks ago ?
How far back could it possibly go .
When was this seed planted in my wife 's brain to have a date night with me all dressed up and formal ?
So many twists and turns - she played her cards well , I never suspected while sitting in the pews next to my wife that when she leaned forward with a pained expression on her face that the evening would end at D'el Arte .
Nor when her condition appeared to worsen and I decided to go get the car to take her to the doctor 's office , nor when I returned to find her lying on the cold hard stone floor of the church could I have ever imagined we would be enjoying a quiet evening together sharing entrees and desserts .
Nor could I have conceived after having multiple people help calling the ambulance , which never came , or the friends who called my in - laws to come take care of the kids , that we would be eating a wonderful pizza by the end of the evening .
No , none of these things would have prepared me for the relief I would feel after waiting 4 hours in the emergency room that her pains were probably only intercostal muscle pains and the test for something more serious were all negative .
Honestly dear , next time just ask me .
I 'll say yes .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I 'm writing as an answer for an advertisement for a job in the USA .
I am fourteen years old and interested in this job and believe I have the qualifications .
I think I would be fit for this job , because I am young , energetic , enthusiastic and have always enjoyed working with children .
I can speak English since I used to vacation in Australia as a child .
I would be helpful in the kitchen as I used to work part - time in my uncle 's restaurant .
I grew up with two younger brothers and used to look after them therefore I am used to dealing with younger kids .
I can also help organise any activity , as I have previously worked in a summer camp in my town with children between the ages of six and ten years old .
In my opinion this job would be a great , helpful experience .
I hope you consider my application and look forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours faithfully ,
Cassie L.
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I have just seen your advertisement for a job in your summer camps .
I 'm Antonio Trevisano del Bruno , an Italian 15-year - old teenager , and I have studied English since I was 7 .
I 'm still improving my English skills with a Canadian teacher .
I am a really sporty person and I think I would be the person who you are looking for because I 'm really capable and patient with children .
In fact , I have been helping in summer camps in Italy for 3 years .
So , I do n't find difficult to organize competitions or activities for children .
I 'm a really cheerful person and , though I am 15 , I 'm keeping up with the kids ' world .
I think it should be easy for me to help in the kitchens because I can cook very well .
This is the experience which I 've been waiting for for ages !
Please do n't hesitate to contact me ! I 'm really looking forward to your reply .
Yours sincerely
Antonio Trevisano del Bruno
First of all , I think , to stay young , you need a goal in life .
I already had mine as a teenager .
In my teens , I was fascinated by planes .
My goal I decided then , was to become a pilot when I grewn up .
I have always tried to live for the future and not fret about the past .
This has helped keep me young .
Besides we all have our close calls in life in one way or another .
Like the one I had in 1926 and all because of a parachute .
It was a foggy January morning and I had gone to renew my pilot 's licence .
The weather report said the ceiling was at 180 metres .
But at 360 metres , I was still surrounded by heavy fog .
Suddenly my plane began to act up , I was losing control .
I sent the plane into a deep dive and landed safely .
I looked at the plane and realized I forgot to tie the parachute cord to the plane .
Thank God I did n't jumped or I would have been a ' dead duck ' for sure !
My name is Bridget Payne , and I 'm 15 years old .

Dear Paul ,
Last month , as you may know , I was a volunteer on occasion of my favourite band 's concert in Katowice .
It was just a miracle - it had turned out that the band 's manager was my good old friend Daniel and he asked me for help when he found out I was a big fan of the group .
Although the work was truly demanding and lasted for quite a while , I must say I really enjoyed it .
At first I had to be involved in it a month before the event was started .
I was asked to give some information about the concert to local pubs , restaurants etc .
so I was handing leaflets everywhere .
By the time the event was upcoming , I had to take over the band 's equipment .
I had to move it from place to place along with boys from the group .
One thing leads to another and we ended up having a beer and laughing in a pub .
Eventually the concert came off just perfectly !
Lots of people showed up , everybody had fun and the best thing in the musical experience is that you can make friends with famous people and those who you admire and only see on TV .
If you will ever have an opportunity to help by this kind of event , I recommend it to you from the bottom of my heart !
Looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
Patrycja .
Dear Johanna ,
I 'm very happy to hear from you since both have been quite busy these days with the exams .
It 's a pity that you have to choose between the activities that you love the most , but I guess that life is full of choices .
If I were you , I would give up music and I am going to explain why .
You have always wanted to be policewoman ( unless you have recently changed your opinion ) so you must be very fit since you need to pass the physical tests , which are very demanding , according to my mother .
Sport is something essential to get this goal and you can always practise music at home when you have some free time ( yes , I know that it happens once in a month ) .
Moreover , you wrote to me that you have started to give lessons about guitar so you are not going to be isolated from music and it goes on playing an important role in your life .
So I think you should n't be upset because now it is a difficult period , I know , but it passes and we can get back our life when we go to university .
My cousin , who is studying English Literatura , told me that you have much more freedom when you start university , so do n't worry !
I hope you write to me when you make the final decision , I look forward to hearing from you .
James Dashner 's The Maze Runner , joins The Hunger Games and Divergent as the latest futuristic Young Adult thriller to get its own film franchise .
The Maze Runner manages to feel remarkably fresh .
It 's punchy , tense and , crucially , original .
The book opens with a boy .
He can remember his name , Thomas , but that 's all he can remember : everything importanthas been wiped clean .
He finds himself in " the Glade " , a farmstead and a camp at the centre of a towering stone maze .
A group of teenagers , all males , have made a makeshift life for themselves there .
Like Thomas , none of them have any real memories of their previous lives , although there 's a barely spoken , horrific suggestion that the lives they 've come from might have been even worse than the ones they 're living now .
At night , the maze grinds shut .
Vicious monsters known as Grievers prowl its twists and turn .
The priority for the boys is to survive , and to find a way out of the maze .
Lnguage itself also becomes vitally important : the boy 's speech is peppered with made - up words that highlight the isolation .
The book ends devastating final twist .
The oldest memory of our relationship is a short skirt and some crocodiles .
Two perfect stigmas for a man and a woman in general .
The task is unambiguous and seemingly easy . I should be able to describe my view of American man and his behavior because of my experience as an adult , a woman , a wife , a mother and simply a human being with various roles in life who has been million times happy and million times unhappy .
However , I am non - American and I live with a man who surprises me every day in a positive and also in a negative way . I can not describe my own husband .
Is it really possible to describe a man at all ?
No . I think that I can depict this one American man within a certain period of time , but it is impossible to write the truth since I have never seen him alive . I can write subjectively and my observations of him through the Internet will be distorted by my own life , experience and surrounding I live in .
Let me introduce one American I got friends with on Facebook .
His name is Kyle .
A typical American name , right ?
However , he is not typical .
He is special .
I like his humor , because he is able to make me smile .
His sensitivity is visible through his carefully chosen words and his decency in his grammatically correct sentences .
I adore his imagination because he is able to kidnap you on a cloud to a never never land .
He is wise and brave , because he was not scared to teach me although he is not a teacher .
But what about those snakes and guns in his photos ?
Would I be able to overcome my own phobias and be fair ?
And what about those open - hearted quotes , love songs and poetic opinions he shares on his wall ?
Is he a romantic and a killer in one ?
He is the man stuck in a generation where loyalty is just a tattoo , love is just a quote and lying is the new truth .
He is the man and I am the woman who live in the world , in which the man wears a short skirt and the woman is as tough as a crocodile .
He always writes gentle words , uses cute smileys , Facebook kisses and hugs , but when I ask him in what way he loves me , he answers " as a Christian " .
Well , it 's all right .
I 'm relieved .
However , the woman inside of me shouts : What ?
He does not love me as a woman !
How come !
I would like to point out another his attribute which is his pride .
When I asked him , if he had read a book The Little Prince by Exupéry because I am feeling like a fox , he asked me in an offended manner , if I know Larry , the comedian .
Kyle is really prideful , but so are all the men .
I do n't believe in the friendship between the man and the woman .
There will always be some kind of sparkling either alluring or repulsing .
Next thing I like about him is that he never pushes me into anything .
If I want to sleep , he stops his own imagination to let me relax and rest .
So he is thoughtful .
I must be honest for a while .
He rose up my own enslaved desires .
I have always wanted to fly , to travel , to paint , to write and to love .
And I am left to love without any support .
He asked me to observe him for a week .
However , I am scared a bit of the consequences of this secret adventure .
What if it breaks me down ?
I mean what if he tames me like a fox ?
He is a hunter .
All the men are .
In following section I will write about his sexuality and dealing with an argument .
It was easy to draw him into the love affair or to make him horny , but it was quite difficult to start an argument with him . I think that he is a good writer because he is able to describe his sexual dreams and thoughts lively and vividly .
However , ask him a question from his real life and he will give you a one - word answer .
This could hardly satisfy an ordinary questioner like me , not only an interviewer from a daily journal .
I believe he is tender and careful , but impatient and clumsy at the same time .
He forgets of everything when he plunges into his Neverland .
No matter what you write , he follows his own lust .
On the other hand , he is disciplined , because he is able to stop with his imagery at once .
He is cute , anyway .
As I wrote before it was not that easy to make the argument with him .
I tried to use different strategic inputs that could help me to argue , for example : You are totally uninterested to read between lines ! You never listen to me!I even called him a lummox and stumblebum .
He just kept quiet and begged me to stop .
He did his best to calm me down .
I was impressed and I find this a good feature of his personality .
Yesterday I wanted him to tell me the story of his life .
He went with the trip from California to Texas and then to Phoenix .
If you like adventurers , well , he is the right man for you .
Sport is a part of men . I should not bypass this issue .
So I asked him what his favourite sport is .
He likes baseball , but he does not play baseball actively .
He likes watching it .
He actively does hiking , hunting and camp riding .
The week has passed , so we are at the end of this adventure course .
Kyle is a strong and charismatic individuality and he values his privacy a lot .
Honestly , I asked myself , if I would like to be his future wife .
I pondered this many times .
And surely , I will .
However , I am not that crazy to marry the man whom I not know in real life .
But I do like him and I loved the course .
It surely taught me a lot and enriched my whole life .
Thank you , Kyle .
In the end , I would like to add a quotation by Franz Marc .
I do not know who Franz Marc is .
But I identify myself with his view of male and female relationship .
" Blue is the male principle , stern and spiritual .
Yellow the female principle , gentle , cheerful and sensual .
Red is matter , brutal and heavy and always the colour which must be fought and vanquished by the other two . "

Subject : Local Environmental Protection
Date : 13th September 2014
Purpose
As requested , this is a report concerning the environmental condition within my town .
The information below evaluates the chief measures taken against pollution and environmental damage as well as the population 's interest and involvement in an optimum preservation of the area .
Recycling
Through a series of programmes and events organised by local voluntary organisations both adults and children are instructed about the importance of waste reduction and recycling .
Therefore , in the last few years there has been a great improvement in raising awareness and commitment among an increasingly larger sector of the population as far as the selective collection of household refuse is concerned .
This is clearly illustrated by the growing number of recycling facilities the residents of our town have at their disposal .
Public Transport
Since exhaust fumes are considered to be one of the major pollutants nowadays , the local authorities are doing everything in their power in order to induce citizens to travel more by means of public transport , in the detriment of the ubiquitous private cars .
Consequently , there are buses which run at short intervals on various routes , so that people can arrive at their destinations rapidly and conveniently .
Unfortunately , only a limited number of people are willing to leave their comfort zone for the sake of the community , thus making pollution by dint of heavy traffic a remaining and inextricable problem of our society .
Public Cleaning Services
Our local public cleaning services are responsible not only for the efficient removal , storage , collection and transport of waste material , but also for the maintenance and good care of natural areas and green spaces within our community .
The sole purpose of their activity is to keep our town clean and neat , making it an appealing and pleasurable place to inhabit .
Conclusion
Taking everything into consideration , it would be fair to conclude that there are numerous ways in which one can protect the environment and take care of the area in which they reside .
However , as with all issues present within society , a dual commitment from the citizens and authorities should be regarded as a key factor .
Red fire ants originated in Brazil .
Fire ants are very aggressive .
They often swarm on their prey swiftly and sting repeatedly to paralyze it .
If we disturb a fire ant nest they would relentlessly sting us , injecting poison into our body .
The sting could be fatal if we have an allergy .
Even if we do n't , stinging will cause a burning sensation , swelling and then a blister at the point of sting .
In mild cases , the sting causes itch .
In severe cases it causes nausea , vomiting or dizziness .
In the US , millions of people are stung annually and some have died from their injuries .
Fire ants threaten more than human health .
In infested areas , they injure livestock , pets and wildlife ; damage crops , plants , electrical equipment , and irrigation systems .
We should use pesticide treatments to reduce their numbers .
here will be several inventions in the next years .
Nowadays we ca n't predict the aim of future devices though I guess that they will be mainly related to eradicating current illnesses .
Cancer , for instance , is surely one of the preferences for the companies that invest large amounts of money in R&D.
Moreover , it is a profitable task if they make up new medications to help people suffering from that illness .
Personally , I consider curing cancer the most challenging goal for the next generation of researchers and inventors .
Although I advocate new remedies for cancer , I think that there is another problem in the world that society should focus on .
It does not fit in rich countries because it concerns to poor countries .
It is usually forgotten because it barely affects our daily routine .
However , when we talk about hunger we must regard it as the main problem of the world .
That is the reason why I have been thinking for a long time about a new device to eradicate starvation .
It is not completely developed but I can advance some ideas about its design .
It consists of a pill where we blend lots of different elements .
Altogether they provide the nutrients to cover the needs of feeding of one person in one day .
Manufacturing costs are not expensive and these pills do not expire .
They can be conserved for a long time and shipping costs are very low .
I consider that it could contribute to feeding many people and it could definitely end with the most unfair problem of this world .
LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL
There must be something very special about a movie when , after the third time , you 're still getting out of the cimena thinking " I have to see it again " .
That 's only happened to me once , and the film was Life is Beautiful .
Starring Italian comic Roberto Begnini ( who also wrote and directed the movie ) in the main role of Guido , this live loving tragic / comedy it 's about a Jewish father trying to shield his young son from the horrors of the nazims in the Italy of Mussolini .
For that matter Guido creates an imaginariy game for his child once they are deported to a concentration camp .
He tells the boy that they are competing with others to win a tank , so the little Guiosué did n't realise what it 's really going on around him .
The strength of the movie relies on the goofy , loving , eccentric character played by Begnini , his exceptional comic talent and his ability as director to deal with such delicate topic like Nazism while managing to drive through a thick line bettween comedy and drama .
The Original soundtrack created by Nicola Piovanni it 's also a beautiful , delicate plus to this masterpiece .
Life is beautiful was recipient of numerous awards including three Oscars as for best foreign picture , best actor and best original dramatic score .
What strikes me more was that despite the fact that it 's set on the eve of the II world war , the film is n't really about the holocaust but a bittersweet fable about human courage love and hope .
If you already haven't seen it , which I doubt , I highly recommend it ; it will make you laugh out loud but also along the way you 'll find yourself cover in tears , Guarantee .
Football , to me , is more than just a game .
I have learned a lot of things from it .
When I joined the team freshman year , I did n't realize what I was getting into .
Football requires tremendous amounts of teamwork and sportsmanship to be successful .
We worked all summer in the weight room and ran on the track to get in physical and mental shape before the season .
See , football is more of a mental sport than anything else , so running on the track was n't only about getting in shape . We would push our minds by running as hard as we could even if we felt like we were going to pass out .
At the beginning , I was immature and only thought of myself , sometimes even giving up when I was tired or hurting .
Then after the third game I had a season - ending injury .
Imagine working all summer and then only being able to play three games !
I needed surgery on my arm and at least five months to recover .
Needless to say , I was sidelined for the rest of the season , but this actually helped me realize that since you never know when your last play will be , you should try your hardest in football and life .
After freshman year I decided that I would always give my best effort .
Playing varsity football has taught me so much more than just what my assignments are on a particular play or how to block . I have learned to think about others first , and realized how important working hard is .
Being with all my friends , even sweating and bleeding with them , really made us bond as a group of hard - working young men I know will succeed in life .
High - school football is more than just a sport .
It is a learning ground for many to strengthen their personality and character for their lives .
One thing my coach always says is , "
Imagine that you have just run 100 sprints and a giant bear starts chasing you .
Are you just going to stand there and let it attack you because you are too tired ? "
The answer , of course , is no , because you can always put it in another gear even if you think you need to give up .
This to me means that you can always control your attitude and effort .
So , no matter what , if you maintain a great attitude and always give whatever you 're doing your best effort , you will have no regrets .
Honestly , I could not agree more , as the website as it is available today is an inconvenient tool providing insufficient informaton .
I would like to suggest improving the website in the following ways .
First , it is difficult to navigate the current website version . We could move the search bar closer to the top in order to make it easier to find .
Besides , adding a schedule to the left section would be an advantage , as our customers would be able to find the option they need in a more convenient way .
Second , the theme is outdated , and developing new design can be a good move to attract more clients .
Minimalistic design is both stylish and user - friendly , as it does not imply any elements requiring website visitors to load heavy modules , and there are no unnecessary banners that distract the user .
Third , implementing several advanced solutions , such as a calculator , a gallery and live chat , could make our page more useful .
As to other aspects of our website , it might be a good idea to enhance its performance by means of optimizing the code and removing advertisements ( which decrease the website value while bringing little profit ) .
All these tasks can be completed within a month , and I would be glad to be involved in the improvement of our website , as it is an important aspect of our work , because it represents the company , and representation is key when attracting clients is concerned .
Before focusing on the topic of technology itself , I would like to mention some aspects related to education .
First of all , Spanish educational laws are in Europe , and probably in the world , the only ones which have changed the most in the last 30 years .
This fact leads the teachers to be unsure of what they are doing .
Besides , there are no results that can be analysed or checked .
Secondly , there are two sorts of schools in Spain - public and private- , which produces a big difference in the educational knowledge .
While public ones must obey governmental laws strictly , private schools have some privileges .
Knowing this about the Spanish education system , we can now talk about technology .
I obviously agree that nowadays technology is necessary .
So , the schools and the educational institutions in general have to update the way they teach .
Technology does not imply a new instrument to be taught but a new tool and source of knowledge ( if used correctly ) .
In fact , using technology without changing the contents would be a total failure .
Teachers must learn how to use these new technological devices in order to get their students motivated .
Moreover , they should comprise the past information and the new one .
Thus , this would help students know how the world has evolved and how it will be .
In other words , technology should be used as a tool for the students be aware of the development of society and its advantages and disadvantages .
This new technologies also help in the teaching development .
We can make dynamic classes by being in contact with other schools , in the case of subjects such as English and French , students would improve their skills by being in contact with students from different countries .
Also , teachers could replace their methodologies following the best ones and the ones which contribute to have qualified students trained to face everyday life situations .
In conclusion , as a great teacher said , we have 21st century students learning with 20th century tools the 19th century knowledge .
Thus , there must not be a technological revolution but an educational one .
To the Mayor
I am writing to express my concern about the smoking ban new law .
I fear that such a huge move would damage businesses and many workers would lose their jobs .
At present , I am working for Cafe Noir , a well - known restaurant popular with visitors , many of whom have told me that if such a ban were introduced , they would would not enter into restaurants and instead , they would meet friends at home .
On top that , I think the amount of notice you have given people is unreasonable .
There needs to be much wider public debate , and if a majority agree , they should be given enough time to get used to .
To support my argument , I would like to tell you what happened in my country when such a ban was introduced .
First , it was almost impossible to enforce it .
There were not enough police to go round checking any public place .
Secondly , business suffered , with people objecting that they should be given the right to smoke if they wished .
In the end , the government changed the law , encouraging people to provide non - smoking areas .
This approach strikes me as much more realistic and I urge you to reconsider it before it is too late .
We will talk about a technology that might soon disturb the world .
But first let me explain the process taken to manufacture anything .
The manufacturing process follows three main stages : designing then producing then consuming .
For a quick glimpse , this technology provides the ability to precisely clone any tangible object .
This directly affects the producing stage , allowing more efficient production .
More efficient production means cheaper goods , and by providing them cheaper the consumer now has the ability to purchase more of these goods .
Higher purchasing power means that we can buy more goods using the same amount of money .
In other words , money would have more value .
So , let 's say , you have $ 100,000 now , you would have $ 10,000,000 fifty years from now .
You then could pay your debt , get a new car , buy a new house , invest or retire , or do just about anything you would do if you currently have $ 10,000,000 in your bank account .
Looking at it through a broader scope , country deficits would be solved , hungry people would be fed , and the homeless would get accommodated .
But why would the goods be cheaper ?
This is the effect of a reduction in the cost of production ; less production cost allows the producer to reduce the price of his goods while maintaining the initial profit .
With competition giving him no choice at all , the producer is forced to abide by the market equilibrium .
Surprisingly , the producer get to maintain his profits due to the proportional decrease in price as well as the cost to produce .
This automatic , efficient , quick , precise technology reduces the amount of labor needed , saves waste initially caused by human errors , saves time and produce at better quality too .
In conclusion , this revolutionary technology has potential to vastly improve the way we manufacture our goods , and in the process of doing that benefit the whole world .
Dogs and cats are called " furkid " not only because their bodies are covered with fur , but also because their hosts regard pets as kids .
I never realized that a furkid would enrich my life until I met Casino , a smart , patient and handsome Golden Retriever raised by my wife 's family .
I can still recall the day Cathy and I brought Casino to Taipei City Hall , walking him along the department store pavement , and playing with him all day long .
Four days later , he suddenly passed away , and the day became our last memory together .
His body was cremated and buried on a mountain in northern Taiwan .
A sweet olive tree was planted with his ashes .
We visited him several times over the years , and decided to take the sweet olive tree home with us this year .
I miss Casino so much .
He changed my attitude toward dogs : Casino taught me through his patience and passions .
Ever since I met him , I stopped feeling frighten when facing big dogs , and even started to play with them .

Finally , I would like to express my willingness in working for you as this will represent such a great experience for me .
I would be able to attend an interview at any time which is convenient to you .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
Celeste Arenas
Dear Sir ,
I am writing this letter because I would really appreciate the opportunity to work as a camp counselor .
I am an 11th grade student from Barcelona , Spain .
I attend Sant Ignasi school and in the future I would really like to study medicine .
Regarding my level of English , I speak fluent English and got an A on the Cambridge First Certificate Exam .
As for my experience with children , I have been a counselor for the last two years in a summer camp .
Furthermore , I have worked as a babysitter for the past year .
I also have been helping a nine years old kid with his math homework .
I believe I am suitable for the job as I am very enthusiastic and energetic .
I am hardworking as well .
I also love playing sports , such as tennis , soccer , canoeing and kayaking .
I always try so hard to not to go to new restaurants because I do n't like most of them at first .
But this time was special .
It was my brother 's birthday so he said if we could go to a new restaurant called Muerde La Pasta .
I 've always Heard about that place so I though it would be okay to go .
The restaurant is in Alcorcon . I have to say that it is a beautiful place , with a lot of beautiful lamps and a lot of space .
It 's a free buffet so you can take everything you want … there are chips , pizza , all types of pasta and then there 's a lot of desserts and there 's no food limit haha .
The staff is so good , they are really helpful and they are always looking if you 've finished to take the dirty dishes away .
Honestly , I thought I would n't like the restaurant but I was completely wrong .. I loved it !
I 'm going with my Friends next week!!I think you get more tan what you pay for like its unlimited food and you only have to pay 10 Euros .
It 's really worth it .
If you did n't go yet , you should definetly do it , I promise you will love it !
After a Year …
You can never really say a thing is worst unless you have indulged yourself in it .
You can never really say a situation is unfortunate unless you have already been to it .
And you can never really say a teacher in the mountain is miserable unless you have experienced being one .
When I knew I would be assigned at Gala National High School , I said it 's the worst thing that ever happened to my career .
When I knew I would be teaching at the remotest high school in Ozamiz , I said I was so unfortunate , and when I knew I would be spending my days in the mountain , I said my life would be miserable .
Indeed , negative vibes filled my thoughts after having known that I was to practice my chosen profession in the place I feared the most .
But after a year , I was all wrong .
My first paragraph aptly expresses my exact realization .
To have been assigned in the mountain is never a worst situation ; I have never been unfortunate , and misery has never been my colleague .
In fact , being a teacher in the mountain is being the best of who I am , being the most fortunate of men alive , and being the happiest I could ever be .
Yes , Gala National High School has given me thousands of reasons to be happy and to feel blessed .
In here , I have learned more than the lessons I have taught .
The school as a whole has become my great mentor .
It has taught me lessons I could n't have learned had I not been here - the lessons that do not only help me improve my teaching profession but also help me become the right person of my ministry .
Gala has paved the way for me to become that teacher I long to see .
I may have been far yet from being an ideal one , but I know someday , having Gala as my guiding light , I can become one .
As to my colleagues , I am grateful to be in a small group of individuals who most of the time shares the same line of interest with me .
We are so small a number , but that does not hinder us to hold any school program and activity at its best .
With our sheer creativity and enthusiasm , we always made it a point that every school activity is worthwhile .
We never settled for any mediocrity .
That is us - the teachers of Gala .
And that 's one thing I love the most .
Together , we aspire for something beyond better .
My personal relationship with my co - teachers is the same as that of a typical Filipino family .
It 's not all the time that we are in good terms , but we know to ourselves that we care for each other .
I may have hurt some of my colleagues in a certain circumstance , and they may have hurt me too , but at the end of the day , it 's always camaraderie among us that dominates .
And it 's all that matters .
As to my students , I feel really so fulfilled .
At first , it was an extreme challenge for me to handle students in the mountain .
Their needs speak beyond intellectual hunger .
Every day I got to deal with students wearing different faces of life 's resentment .
As a teacher , it took me much of everything I have to come to terms to every pitiful fate of my students .
Hence , the value of UNDERSTANDING the students even beyond what the meaning of such word can express has been dramatically instilled in me .
And that 's one of the lessons I consider a gem to keep to myself forever .
Students in the mountain have a lot of different untold stories of their lives .
These stories once heard , can open somebody 's heart to learn to love learners despite everything .
That is what exactly happened to me .
As I listened to my students , I have come to realize the very essence of my existence as their teacher .
Consequently , I have seen the need to attend to their needs .
I may have not perfectly carried out my responsibilities , but I know somehow in my one year stay in Gala , I have made a difference to my students ' lives .
My everyday interaction with my students has been my everyday fulfillment .
Eventually , the huge challenge I have had has turned into my inspiration to do better in my job .
My students have a lot of weaknesses in many aspects of life , but seeing them enduring was motivating me even more to give them good reasons to keep on keeping on .
My dear students may have not known it , but really , they are too the source of my inner strength .
There were times I wanted to back off from the many demands of work , but I always found myself fighting .
I have more than enough reason to do that - and they are again , my students .
In a nutshell , Gala may have been very far , yet it my heart , it 's just within .
The place , my colleagues , and my dear students are enough testimonies that in Gala I have found a home … and a family to love , really for real .
Dear Mrs Kate Ashby ,
I am writing to you regarding a job advertisement I saw on yesterday 's newspaper looking for an English - speaking person to work at weekends in your cafe .
I am the right person to do the job as I have always been interested in different kinds of food .
I like trying dishes from all over the world and I am keen on cooking experimenting new exotic cuisine .
I am really interested in applying for this job because I am an outgoing person and I am good at dealing with people .
In addition to this , I have broad experience in this field since I worked as a waitress during my last summer holiday .
As a consequence I am prepared to work long hours .
I hope you will take my application into consideration because I have a great sense of responsibility and work very seriously .
I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience .
Yours faithfully ,
Marina
Dear Sir :
It is not an easy task to explain the importance of this exam for me , since I do not have any specific objective in mind that requires a Cambridge certification .
Similarly , I do not have any study methods in the sense of systematic mechanisms to learn English .
What I can say is that I have been learning English since I was twelve , and it has been a pleasure from the start .
My first memory related to the English language is of lyrics ; I love pop music and used to translate songs composed by Elton John and Lennon and McCartney .
Next I started to read books such as the Harry Potter series and books by George R. R. Martin .
I am also an attentive listener of BBC Radio Four .
These are my study methods , if I can say so .
About the reasons to take the test , there is little to say .
As I have said , I have been learning English by the sheer pleasure of it ; but , having come this far , I think it is time to get some kind of formal recognition about my level .
What do people think about teenagers ?
Why rather negative ?
Lots of people think , that teenagers are stupid , have a small knowledge about life , do not have enough experience , are annoying , difficult to understand .
In my opinion we should n't think like that .
I agree that some of young people behave really badly , they smoke , shout on their parents , drink beer , do not improve themselves .
But most of teenagers are even more intelligent than adults or erderly people .
At school , at home they have to cope with lots of problems and try to solve them .
I strongly disagree that they are not experienced .
They sometimes have to help their friends or even their parents in difficult tasks like psychical problems , give them tips .
Sometimes it happens that a couple , which has a child in age from 12 - 16 , querls .
The young person has to be strong , try to understand the situation .
Tennagers also have to make serious decisions like choosing secondary school , future job , which way they will go in their life , if they want to be in relationship with someone .
Those examples show that teenagers have to cope with lots of problems .
Most of them are able to .
Of course it 's only my opinion .
Ways to collect and record information for future generations
Finding the best way to collect and store information for the future is not just a problem in our working life but also in our private life .
That is the reason why our class attended a panel discussion on this specific topic .
Different ways of accumulating and storing information were presented at the discussion .
I would like to emphasise two options in this essay .
One way to get the information needed is to interview people from the neighbourhood and either write down what is being said or record it as an audio - file .
This way you do not only gather plain data but also emotions from people .
Additionally , it happens that while speaking of a particular event suddenly more memories and stories come to the narrator 's mind .
However , sometimes the narrator tends to fill in the gaps of his / her memory with imaginary parts or tries to embellish certain parts of the story .
Another interesting way to find out more about the past is to collect old photographs .
This is an impressive way to document a change over many years , but on the other hand it is challenging to keep photographs in good condition .
For me personally , the best way to collect and record information for future generations is to interview people and to store the information in an appropriate way because of three reasons : Firstly , I have the chance of not getting just one story from a person but maybe two or three more .
Secondly , I can catch the the narrator'semotions .
Thirdly , I do not have to be concerned about loss of qualitiy of photographs and pictures .
When I was in Bali , I had a great night that I always remember .
My husband and me went to a dinner on the beach of our hotel .
The weather was very good and we enjoyed having dinner barefoot , sat on the sand .
The dinner was delicious and we tasted lots of new flavours of Balinese food .
After dinner , we saw an interesting show of Balinese dance and music .
When we thouhgt that the night had finished , we had the perfect dessert .
Despite it was very dark , we could see something moving on the sand .
It was very big ... We could n't believe what we were seeing .
It was a very big and beautiful turtle !
But ...
It was lost and could n't find the way to the water .
We shouted and two waiters of the hotel came quickly .
They turned the turtle and took it to the water , where freed it .
Then the turtle started swimming and disappeared of our sight .
We were very happy because of seeing the turtle and hope to come back to Bali to see it again .
In terms of holidays , some people like to visit their own countries , while others prefer going abroad .
I think going abroad is much more exciting .
Visiting their own country certainly has its advantages .
First of all , you do n't have to take very long trips .
Also , you can have the opportunity to discover new places just next to your home .
Besides , this type of vacation is usually less expensive than going abroad .
On the other hand , many people prefer visiting other countries .
Actually , they like the idea of visiting an unknown land , where everything is different , from the weather to the habits .
Furthermore , they also like going abroad to visit important and famous cities around the world , like Paris , Madrid , New York .
In my opinion , traveling to a foreign country makes people open their minds to other cultures .
In fact , going abroad is a nice way to make new friends , try new things and improve a foreign language .
In addition , if you plan your vacation very soon , you can also save money on planes or hotels .
In conclusion , I think it 's important to know both their own countries and foreign lands .
It was three in the morning when the phone rang .
I was just about to go to bed when I suddenly heard the phone and I got scared because I was alone at home , and I thought that it could be serious news .
It was in August , my parents and my brother were on holiday in Mallorca for a week , and that same day my sister and her boyfriend travelled from Yecla to Paris in a package travel .
At that moment I thought that an accident or a similar something had happened to my family but fortunately it was n't so .
A girl was on the other side of the phone and she told me that my sister and her boyfriend were n't with the other passengers .
They did n't have mobile phones because it happened a long time ago .
The film I 'd like to talk about is " Secret Life of Walter Mitty " .
It is a fantastic film with beautiful views and an exciting story .
The main character , Walter Mitty , works in a well - known magazine " Life " as a manager of photo negatives .
One day he gets a parcel from a famous traveller .
In his letter he says that one shot from the film is the best picture he has ever made .
Unfortunately , Walter can not find the shot , so he has to look for the traveller which is not easy .
He has to travel to remote parts of the world and have some very amazing adventures .
In the end , he manages to meet the traveller and find out where the shot is .
I wo n't tell you any more as it can spoil the story , but the film is definitely worth watching .
In addition , I can say that I 'm charmed by the main character who is developing throughout the whole film .
If you like complicated stories about dreams and how to make them true , this story is definitely for you .
Free of pocket pain & frequented by the locals , there is a dining gem in Nova Gorica .
Heading towards Tolmin & after passing the famous Solkan Bridge , turn right and follow the road to the left .
You will find there a parking area and some ball courts , and on further exploration , just after the courts & walking towards that famous bridge that you can now see much better , a restaurant .
For seasonal food served by obliging & good humoured waiters , you will find nowhere better .
In summer that boiler of dark liquid beside the entrance might be Kopriva chai , a summer herbal digestif , favoured by the villagers of the region , or you might be offered a world war one menu such as soldiers may have eaten in this area .
Day , date and season dictate the ever interesting & changing menu at this restaurant .
The warm interior is the perfect place to eat in winter , while in summer , many diners prefer the exterior tables beside the turquoise Soca river .
One of Slovenia 's qualified somnelliers will help you choose from the good wine cellar , so this is the place where I recommend our class can relax , eat , drink well & enjoy the happy atmosphere .
I would like to talk to you about a musical which I saw recently .
It is called " Les Miserables " and has much to recommend it , including the plot , the cast and , of course , the soundtrack .
The film is set in France in nineteenth century .
Just after the French Revolution .
It is an adaptation from the original book " Les Miserables " by Victor Hugo .
The idea lying behind the story is that justice and law are not the same thing .
The main character , Jean Valdjean , played by Hugh Jackman , is jailed for stealing a loaf of bread , in a try to avoid his nephew 's death .
Then after being left free , he become a thief again , however this time he is not condemned because of a prier .
But do not worry I am not going to spoil the ending .
All it occurs during the first part of the film .
Regarding the soundtrack , I can only say that since I saw the film I can not help singing every song all the time .
All in all I think that it is one of the best films ever made .
Travelling by car is becoming more convenient .
Cars are improving , becoming safer and environment friendlier .
A lot of effort has been put into reducing the fumes , etc .
Moreover , people have become more aware of the environment protection .
Thus , more and more people , when buying a new car , also consider its environmental friendliness and the possible impact on the community .
Also , cars get more affordable in many countries .
For example , in India nd China the technological advances have enabled them to mass produce really affordable cars , which are also imported .
Together with that , more people are getting familiar with driving and feeling more confident about driving their own car .
Once you know for yourself how comfortable it is to have a car , there 's very little chance you will go back to public transport .
However , there might be still room for public transport in future , especially in big cities .
I mean the underground in the first place .
It is very economical in terms of time , distance and people capacity .
As for buses , they might be history in decades to come .
Although I do n't quite like watching soap operas , I was started watching this particular show with my family .
My mother likes watching soap operas on tv and she got me hooked onto this new tv show - iknmp .
The show looked promising through its promos , which were based on a very famous old hindi song .
The lead actors were well known tv stars .
The show was based on the journey of a married couple , living in India , who get separated due to some misunderstandings .
The couple have 4 kids and after separation , 2 kids live with their mom and 2 with their dad .
The dad , who is a cardiologist moves to US and starts a new life there .
The mom on the other hand decides to stay back and works hard to give her children a decent life .
The show starts with the eldest daughter , who lives with her mother trying to contact her father to ask him to be a part of her wedding ceremony .
The father who had vowed to never look back at first ignores her requests , however , upon insistence from his other children and his sister agrees to go back to India .
The rest of the show is based on the interactions between all 4 children and how they work together to unite their family .
It 's a typical Indian soap opera in which love conquers over everything .
Although not very practical , the show is fun to watch as it brings out the Indian values and at the same time teaches the importance of women being independent and able to lead life on their own .
Innovative entrepreneurship can be perceived as a special process of creating , testing and implementing of the new products and materials , the new way of resource utilization and the new kind of management in business process to find advanced opportunities for ( non)commercial use .
The first test has shown that I am very motivated and my skills almost fit to the possibility to be an entrepreneur .
However , the attitude that I have is not very appropriate for entrepreneurship .
It is important to underline that the driving factors ( motivation ) determine behaviour of entrepreneur and show the reasons for acting .
In the test were accessed the answers and I was found out as a person that has high control appeal meaning that I have great leading skills and a need to organize and to moderate .
In the motivation part I also received high score in need of challenges as I prefer to take difficult projects because I believe that they might develop my knowledge and abilities .
Moreover , it is really important for me to be own boss even though it needs much more responsibilities .
Nevertheless , in the test I received fewer points in " need for achievement / success " than it was required for being an entrepreneur .
As I found out there were two problems about lack of points .
The first one was based on profit orientation of the entrepreneur in the test .
The above - mentioned situation means that during the assessment were not taken into account other goals that entrepreneur might have .
For instance , it can be the social sustainability and a need to develop the local employment situation or an entrepreneurship as a hobby / lifestyle .
The second problem was based on essential role of getting a feedback .
However , the test evaluated as important feedback parents and friends opinion and I do not agree that it might be essential unless they are specialists in that field .
Nevertheless , I might take a reasonable risk in case it can positively influence business .
PLANE , TRAIN OR BOAT ?
Everyone likes something more or less , even when it comes to little things .
It is certain that each of us loves to travel , but everyone likes the most comfortable means of transport .
For me , the best way to travel is train , because I think this mode of transportation has the most pros .
One of the things that is very important to me is the price .
I 'm not going to spend a lot of money for a ticket , because I 'm studying so I just have a part - time job .
If we check the prices of air travel , we can be disappointed as well as of travel by boat .
Fortunately the train tickets are cheaper .
Another very important thing is the travel time .
Plane flies very quickly , but you have to be at the airport at least an hour earlier .
In the case of a ship , travel time is immense .
Travelling by train is quite fast , and pleasant , I can safely travel to more places worldwide than people taking a boat or plane transport .
After the summary is to certify that travelling by train is the most advantageous , but the most important reason why I chose journey by train a fact that I have a motion sickness , and I 'm afraid to fly .
At the end of a decade in which technology has made enormous leaps , I am thinking about how much present vision of house will change in the future .
Despite many differences in the human nature , the present houses do not differ so much between themselves .
Most of the homes have walls , doors , windows and are built on solid ground .
Furthermore , they have flat or sloping roofs , one or more floors .
Some are situated in the neighbourhood of parks , forests or lakes .
On the other hand , recently , more often many new and more advanced projects are realized by daring architects .
They often do not use the popular brick but glass , wood , plastic .
But can you imagine that in the near , unspecified future all homes will be like that ?
Built by using the most modern technology , full of the latest inventions which man can create ?
Of course , for people to live better , but it would be useful to modern houses to be constructed so as to do not damage the environment .
I think quite few scientists still surprise us , and the house of the future will go beyond the limits of our imagination .
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN SPAIN
There has been major changes regarding the teaching approach in the last few years , but there is still room for improvement .
If we focus on the teaching of English as a foreign language , we possibly could see this more clearly .
In the early 1980s the activity in the classroom was focused on grammar .
However , speaking , listening activities and the massive use of I.T mark the schedule nowadays .
All these changes make the learning process much more fun , creative and practical for the students .
The new teaching approach is based on how students can effectively use the language rather than on the knowledge of the language they actually have .
This new outlook on the teaching procedures consists of the use of the so called alternative assessment as a way to evaluate learners ' skills .
A grammar test shows knowledge about the language , whereas alternative assessment shows learners ' ability to efficaciously use the language in the context of a real situation .
There are many reasons for using alternative assessment techniques : learners demonstrate things learned , take responsibility , motivation may increase and they have the opportunity to use language for actual purposes .
It is important to notice that the difficulty to carry out the changes towards the new teaching approach- referred to above- lies not with the students themselves but with the old generation of teachers , since they sometimes have trouble applying the new outlook on education methods .
In conclusion : The way of teaching is changing in the last few years all over Spain .
The main reason for that could be found by overlooking the matters related to new teaching methods developed recently .
However , a smooth transition to the new approach is still necessary to overcome the massive education - related challenges Spain will have to face in the upcoming years .
In the year 2020 there was conflict between Japan and the United states .
The conflict was due to trend creation , citizens between both countries wanted to see who created better and bigger trends .
This conflict was an incentive for clothing stores to sell new and weird things for a higher price .
Law enforcers also wanted for their country to win , and in the United States policemen arrested any Japanese person they saw and sent them back to Japan .
The Japanese government made a competition to see which of their citizens was the best trend - setter .
The winner 's reward was the ability to rule over Japan for a day .
After two years , the winner was decided , and he made Japan go into poverty .
Once the day was over , the Japanese government tried to reverse all of the damages done , but it was impossible .
The winner had changed Japan 's landscape , what once was the amazing city of Tokyo now was a sad and dirty city .
Japan asked the United states for help , they gladly agreed , and they dragged Japan back up to their normal status .
Japan lost a lot , but it was able to get back up on its feet .
Everyone was happy for some time and true peace between the countries of the world had been achieved , but then the United States enslaved Canada and tried to enslave Japan as well , but they were able to defend themselves .
Japan launched a counter attack and enslaved the United States , and then proceeded to conquer the world .
A new era was created , it was the most brutal time period in the history of mankind , it was known as many things most people named it " The Japan Era " , but it was so brutal that the official name was " The Dark Yellow Era "
I would like to recommend the following movie : " The perfume " .
This movie can be considered a classical thriller , but with several aspects that makes it unique in this gender .
First of all , the historical period is the victorian age in France .
Landscapes are really wonderful .
The buildings , dresses , and habits of population are displayed in full detail .
Secondly , we have and amazing script that can be considered unique .
The story tell us the importance of the perfume in all aspects of our lifes .
The movie 's main plot describes the early years of our starring , a poor orphan , which takes advantage of his powerful smell sense to find out new jobs .
We will discover the importance of a unique fragrance and how to mix the ingredients in the right proportions .
This idea will create the atmosphere to tell us a story about crime and passion .
Finally we will discover a fantastic ending that we would never imagine through the movie watching .
The overall rate of this movie is really high and it is a movie to remember forever .
Nevertheless this is not an all audiences movies , because it contains hard scenes not suitable for children .
If people can rent this movie or watch it online I would encourage watch it as fast as possible .
Few other modern movies are so great in comparison .
The two hours that you will spend watching the movie will become unique in your life .
Many people believe that public transport will be replaced by private one in the nearest future .
The main reason is the convenience of travelling by cars in comparison with using public transport .
Apart from that , there are many other benefits in buying a car instead of using buses or underground every day .
First of all , an automobile gives such a valuable thing as privacy .
For example , driving a car we can wear whatever we want and listen to the music on any volume .
If the car is large enough , it can be even a perfect place for sleep .
Additionally , if we are eager to travel outside the town in order to have some rest from a hectic rhythm of life , it will be more comfortable for us to use our cars .
Only our own vehicle can provide us with an opportunity to find any quiet and pleasant place outside the city .
Public transport can take us just to certain locations .
Thus , it is clear that private transport such as automobiles has plenty of advantages .
On the other hand , we can stuck with different problems while travelling by car .
For instance , staying in traffic jams always steals much our precious time .
Car accidents are the typical reason for this phenomenon .
It means that travelling by cars can even be more dangerous than using public transport .
Generally , bus drivers are much more experienced than automobile ones , therefore , accidents caused by public transport happen quite rarely .
This makes travelling by public transport much safer .
Thus , I would argue that driving a car requires much attention and understanding that careless behaviour on the road can make a serious damage to other people .
In conclusion , I believe that public transport will eventually lose its dominance due to the fact that all people want to be independent and travel on their own .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .
She was woken up very early by the sun coming through her window .
She opened her sleepy eyes , smiled gently and got up from her bed idly .
She went downstairs to the cosy bathroom and had a shower .
After that , she dressed up and went to the kitchen to make a breakfast .
She turned on the music and started to prepare a healthy meal .
After aeting delicious salad and drinking tea , she went to her room to do her hair and put the make - up on .
Anna was a bit stressed , but she was sure , that everything will be alright .
While she was getting ready , she heard a door bell .
She came down and opened the door - it was her mother .
They hugged and smiled to each other .
Anna 's mother looked at her tenderly and hugged her once again .
She came in and noticed that her daughter is a little nervous , so she decided to make a coffee , sit and talk for a while .
As they were talking , Anna 's best friends came up .
They looked really cheerful and excited .
They quickly took her upstairs to the room .
After some time friends came down and told Anna 's mother , that she is ready and she is going to come in a while .
She stood up and looked at her daughter coming down the stairs .
Anna looked incredibly beautiful .
Her mum came to her and hugged her really affectionately . "
It 's your big day .
One of the most important moments in your life .
I am so happy " said mother with a tear in her eye .
It was Anna 's wedding day .
Aiming high !
My all - time favourite sport is basketball .
I started playing at the age of seven , when my mother encouraged me to join a basketball club .
It was very enjoyable from the onset , and has been a fantastic experience to learn the sport together with other children .
Another key factor was the coach , who knew how to convey the skills and techniques to children .
Moreover , I was fascinated by the feeling of belonging to a team in which each member shares the same goals and values .
This is an important feature that will also help anyone in all spheres of life .
One also learns to work hard and disciplined in order to achieve success .
All these points led to me playing basketball for almost thirty years now and I 'm still hooked by it .
If someone would ask me for advice on how to start playing basketball , I would probably suggest starting with a trial practise and if the person enjoys it , he / she can join the club .
When choosing a club , I believe it 's important that an experienced coach is present who knows how to teach the basics .
Yours faithfully ,

One of my favorite restaurants in Málaga is called Sun and Shine .
Is situated in the city center , near the seaport .
It is a different kind of restaurant , because you can find not only the typical Spanish food , also dishes from different parts of the world .
What I like most of this restaurant is that it offers healthy and balanced food , the flavor is fantastic , the food very tasty and carefully cooked .
You can enjoy original food , good quality on a budget .
On the other hand the surroundings are modern , the place is airy and cosy .
The waiters are very welcoming and informative so you feel very comfortable .
All the ingredients are very fresh and of the highest quality .
In my opinion the salad is the best option , with a big range of types from different countries .
My favorite one is the Italian salad , because it is healthy and the sauce they use is savoury and strange .
Finally I really recommend this restaurant , especially for couples or friends that want to try something different and newfangled .
Dear Paul ,
I hope all is well with you .
I 'd like to thank you for the lovely experience you offered me .
I really enjoyed helping out at the concert last month .
Unfortunately we did n't get the chance to see each other that night .
I suppose you 'd like to hear about my experience .
I started the evening by welcoming everyone and appointing them their seats .
I enjoyed this very much , because I got the chance to meet a lot of people .
Later that evening , I worked behind the bar .
During two hours I served drinks .
What I enjoyed the most , was helping backstage , where I got the chance to meet the artists .
They were such nice people and really appreciated my help .
At the end of the evening I worked at the parking lot .
All in all a great experience ! You can rely on my help next year !
Thanks again for the lovely experience !
Regards ,
Camille .

Canada is a nation built of citizen - soldiers .
From soldiers who served in the trenches of France to the ceremonial functions in the nation 's Capital .
Nathan Cirillo is remembered as one of those soldiers .
A member of The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada , he was killed at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in October 2014 .
He was standing guard , at the memorial , when he was shot dead from behind at point blank .
One year later a commemoration of his passing was celebrated .
His death shocked a nation .
Unarmed , at attention , and protecting the memory of those who gave the ultimate sacrifice , his last moments and those who came to his assistance , exemplify the true meaning of being Canadian .
Canada is a peaceful nation always ready to wear the uniform when called upon by its country .
Events like these confirm that Canada is no longer immune to attacks on home soil .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing in reply to your advertisement in the European Observer of April 7th for a post at USA Summer Camp .
I am aged 44 , of Austrian nationality , married and hold the Cambridge English Advanced certificate since last summer .
I would welcome an opportunity to work in the USA this summer in order to practise my English .
Cheerfulness is in my nature and I am used to working hard . I would be happy to support the USA Summer Camps team in every aspect .
I am also experienced with children , having looked after my sister 's daughters aged 9 , 11 and 14 for years now .
Whenever possible I take the girls out for a swim or a ride on their bikes .
It is also a good idea to play badminton and minigolf with them .
In the evenings , singing , dancing and torchlight walks are a good alternative to watching TV .
Further , I worked as an au - pair in France and Canada , where I watched over 3 , respectively , 2 children .
Finally , cooking is a hobby of mine and I would be happy to work in the kitchens too .
I look forward to your reply at your earliest convenience .
Sincerely yours ,
Patrick
Eating with strangers .
In the growing " sharing " economy , online communities are offering peer to peer for almost anything .
One of my favourite is eatwith.com .
It 's a website which allow me to taste food from around the world without moving from my city , at the same time that you can speak different languages and meet new people .
The best thing about this web is that very easy to use .
First , you have to select the city New York , Barcelona , etc .
Second , you choose a menu and make a reservation .
You can use this web if you are a tourist or just someone who wants to enjoy a dinner in your own city .
On the other hand , if you are a professional or an amateur chef , you 'll earn an extra money .
There 's nothing like share a meal with local people , it offers you the possibility to glean from someone who lives in the place .
The wedding of my niece was celebrated in Barcelona last weekend .
It was the most exciting and beautiful party I have ever been to .
First of all , my mother , my children , my partner and I took the train in Zaragoza to go to Barcelona .
It was a pleasant journey that lasted only two hours .
When we arrived in Barcelona we went by taxi to the hotel , which my brother had previously booked , and there we met with other relatives : my brother , his wife , my nephews and of course my niece ( the bride ) .
My brother 's wife 's close relatives were also there .
We all went together to have lunch to a nearby restaurant .
After lunch we could have a nap or start to prepare for the wedding .
I managed to make my mother have a siesta , so that she was more energetic for the party .
The marriage ceremony took place at a wonderful church , there were flowers everywhere , live music , three hundred guests and of course , the bride and the bridegroom , the most beautiful and happy couple I have ever seen as far as I can remember .
Hundreds of photos were taken before , during and after the wedding .
The party was held in a large garden near the bridegroom 's fathers ' house .
A historic building in one of the most luxurious places in Barcelona .
There were delicious snacks and drinks before the dinner .
The dinner was a three main course meal which had been carefully chosen by the new couple .
The party continued with a splendid dancing until seven in the morning .
Taking a break between leaving school and starting college seems unnecessary .
If you are wealthy , or you come from a family where your father can provide you with most of the things you want , I suggest going to college straight away will be a good idea .
Some of us are afraid to travel because of the newborn cases of ISIS .
Terrorism is everywhere .
Mass shooting , bombs , hacking into security system can happen any time , any day .
Not many of us are going to risk our lives , especially when we all know we are going to have a fresh start in college .
However , for those who really need to fork out money to pay college loans , it is best for them to take a year off and work part time at a cafe , or somewhere remotely interesting .
It is wise for them to find some time to save some money so they would not need to struggle during college .
However , some just want to have some fun , after years in high school , after so many years of break ups , after so many years of eating cafeteria food , it is time to find some enjoyable time with quality friends and with mouth - watering food .
They just want to forget about the past and focus on the present .
In their minds , it is all about having fun but is it really what it is ?
What if they forget themselves ?
What if they changed into some monster they can not suppress ?
What if drugs , alcohol , cigarettes took over their lives ?
Is that how they want to start college ?
The real question is , do they want to actually be an alcoholic and a drug addict when they enter college ?
Look , they are still very young and they are all prone to bad influences through parties without parental control .
Hence , if there is no reason to take a year off , just go to college and start studying .
There is absolutely no time to waste your youth on drugs and alcohol .
2 years ago , I was a bad guy who wanted to fight anyone , so no one wanted to be my friend .
One day in the post , I had an argument with a man who studied in the same university as me , and I challenged him to fight with me : I thought it would solve the problem between us .
He did not want to fight with me because he was smaller than me , so he just ignored me and walked away .
That made me get crazy and angry , so I knocked him down with only one punch .
After that he told the teacher who was responsible for that class , and called me into her room and asked me questions .
At that time , I was really proud of myself that I could beat him so easily .
The day after , I was thinking deeply and just realized that I was wrong and should not hurt him because I was angry .
I decided to talk to him and asked him to forgive me .
I felt relieved he forgave me .
This story tells us that sometimes we can not control ourselves , but we should be alone and think positively or take a deep breath , and these will make us calm down .
Hi , my name is Priscila and I just realized that I am a writer , too .
I am Brazilian and I started to learn how to write in Portuguese when I was 7 years old .
I think this period when we start to write is magical , because we can access an entire new communication world .
From 7 to 18 years old , I mainly wrote for school during classes , homework , and tests .
When I was 16 , I lived in Nicholson - PA - USA .
I was an exchange student and attended high school there .
That was the first time my work was assessed by the way I wrote in English .
This experience was very important and made me more confident about my English skills .
Back to Brazil , during college I started researching and writing about economics .
I love economics , so I kept studying and I have got a masters and a PHD degree in labor economics .
I had to write a dissertation and a thesis and , I will not lie , these writing processes were very hard , but I learned a lot about academic writing .
Today , I work as an economics professor at the Federal University of Goias , in Brazil .
Because of my work , I have to write all the time to my students , to my colleagues and to the academic community in general .
I want to discuss the results of my research with everyone that is interested in it , from Brazil or from any other place in the world .
Therefore , for me , writing in English , now , is more important than ever .
I expect that this course will help me develop my English skills , so that I can write my papers , communicate and discuss my research in more effective way .
In modern world , public transport become less important as travelling by car is said to be more convenient . Travelling by car also reduces their time of journey and they do n't need to wait for a particular bus .
It may also because as people are getting richer they do n't need to go for a public transport as more comfortable option is always there waiting for them .
Though public transport is more advantageous to the environment , people just want to get their personal needs satisfied .
The world is moving faster and everyone has to be fast enough to compete with this modern world .
While comparing the drawbacks of public transport with modernized vehicles , public transport may not seems to be a better choice .
But this is not true .
More usage of vehicles may cause serious problems such as depletion of natural resources and environmental issues such as pollution .
Although the maintenance cost of car is quite expensive , it does not stop people from using cars since convenience matters to them the most and not money .
Many people think that public transport is only for poor and not for rich .
If it continues , no resource will be spared for the future generation .
Everyone should remember , " Nature has enough resources to satisfy our needs , not our greed . "
Nowadays , many people around the globe are trying to acquire a second language , when it comes to decide between learning in our own country versus learning abroad , we can find several pros and cons that might get us fairly confused .
On the one hand , an advantage of studying in your own country is that you would be able to share with people with the same problems during their learning process as you .
However , a major drawback would be the lack of exposure to the language that is intended to be learnt .
On the other hand , the most important advantage of studying abroad would be precisely , the exposure , which would help you understand the language from native speakers ' point of view and be aware of how some expressions or words are actually used .
However , as a disadvantage , we must consider the cost of studying abroad , because it can be rather expensive .
To sum up , the best way of learning English , or rather the best place to do it depends on each person 's means and learning style , but definitely it is possible to acquire a second language both at home and abroad .
People try to skip Good Friday because , there is no feasts in that day .
Moreover , it is the sombrest day in a year , which recalls people the Crucifixion caused by people 's sins .
People prefer to meet happiness and positive thinking then talking about a death and a suffering .
They want to skip this day and move to Easter Sunday- the day of happiness and renewal .
Accordingly , the author compares the Easter to a pagan spring festival , where people were joyful because of spring coming just as a Christians 's cheerfulness of the Resurrection .
2 . We flinch from consideration of Good Friday because we do not like thinking of a sad situation .
People choose pleasant entertainments instead of talking about a death , a suffering and a self - sacrifice .
Today people are not willing to sacrifice themselves for other people .
Everyone is individual and worries about themselves , because it is easier way to live .
Above all , people are not used to undergo suffering and what is more brutal death .
4 . The author mentions the origin of the word ' compassion ' , in order to remind people the meaning of that word .
It refers to ' suffer with ' .
Nevertheless , people make this compassion tided away , because it is too painful for them to stand that .
Not only they run away from uncomfortable situations but they also prefer to see them on screens .
Actually , they choose the Good Life , because they can not cope with their own suffering without cultural understanding .
I want to write about the best vacation I ever had .
It took place about two years ago .
My school friends and me went to Dominican Republic , it 's a Caribbean country with amazing beaches .
Even though I do n't like places like that , I rather enjoyed this trip a lot .
Maybe it was because I was with my friends and I could find many ways to spend my time with them or it could also be the great environment .
I remember we got there the first of October on a Saturday night , and I will never forget the rush of warmth I felt as soon as I stepped out of the plane .
First , I thought that it was something else causing the warmth , but later on I learned that the weather was like that all the time and I just had to get used to it .
When we got to the resort we all checked in and went to our designated rooms . I was sharing a room with my friend Emily .
After unpacking we left our room to see the rest of the resort .
We found a club , 3 big pools , sports fields and , of course , the amazing beach , though we could n't see much of it because it was really dark at night .
The next day , we made sure to go to the beach early and we had a blast with our other friends .
This went on until the last day of our trip .
We were , obviously , sad because this amazing time was ending but happy as well for the memories we shared together . I will remember this vacation for the rest of my life .
Television is one of the most important inventions of the last century since it has had a great impact on societies around the world .
Since Television was first invented , it has influenced different aspects of people 's lives .
Since Television was launched to the market it has acquired other purposes besides entertaining , such as communicating and advertising , that is way the possibility of it having educational purposes has been widely discussed .
Television can certainly educate , it has great potential for doing so because of the way it presents information and the scope of people it can achieve .
Television can educate in several ways , to mention some : by providing and extending information given in certain curses at school , and by providing information that is not even taught at school .
It is very exciting that entertainment and education can be merged for accomplishing the spread of knowledge along the masses in an enjoyable way .
Television can educate through content whose main purpose at first was entertaining .
Television series , contests , movies , and news which do it all the time without us being aware of it .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am writing regarding the advertisement on USA SUMMER CAMPS .
I found this advertisement on the newspaper and I would like to state the reasons why I think I am suitable for the job at hand .
First of all , I would like to point out that I have some experience in the area , since I have worked as a group leader before .
Last year I was in Canada and two years ago I fulfilled the same role in England .
The groups I was in charge of mostly consisted of people from ages 6 to 12 , although I once had the chance to work with a group of young adults as well .
Everywhere I have worked before I have been praised for being very organised and having the ability to deal with unexpected situations successfully .
I like to consider myself an energetic person .
Usually , I do n't have much time to spend on myself since I am always occupied with something .
I have taken part of a basketball team since the age of 5 and I have recently become a young ladies ' group 's coach .
As for my cooking abilities , I used to work as a kitchen assistant during the summertime .
I did that for three summmers and I still help out at my parents ' restaurant when a hand is in need .
I would really appreciate it if you could take my application into account .
If you do , I would also like to be sent the accommodation details , if possible , to the following address : 62Dssy7@gmail.com .
If you need any other details , let me know so that I can send them to you as soon as possible .
Yours faithfully .
Rosa .
P.S. I have attached my CV

This year , I have finished my degree in Mathematics in the University of Zaragoza and in September , I will start to study to become in teacher .
I also have studied English language for ages and I consider that I have a good level .
Moreover , this job would be an excellent experience to improve my English and be more selfconfident .
As for my experience , I love working with children and I sometimes took care of my nieces which they are 10 years old .
My degree took up all my free time during this year , however , I tried to go on doing sport , especially running and playing football . I also try to keep up with the latest trends in sports events .
I describe myself as a sociable , responsible , trustworthy and hardworking person which likes working with children .
For all these reasons , I feel that I have a lot to offer your summer camp .
I enclose my CV and I would be glad to attend an interview at any time convenient for you .
I look forward to hearing from you very soon .
Yours faithfully ,
My favorite sport is Football , but it is not a sport that I like to practise it 's a sport to watch because it 's beautiful , very cool and very exciting to support a team in a championship .
I am Brazilian , and as almost everybody in my country , I 'm a big football fan .
I 've always loved to watch soccer , since I was a little kid , because my father was a great fan of the biggest team in Brazil , Flamengo .
Actually , in his honor I had a Flamengo shield tattooed on my back on the left side because there was n't a better way to pay homage to him than a Flamengo tattoo .
The World Cup is happening now in my country Brazil .
I love it when this event happens , so many incredible games going on , best players of the world , three games per day at the start , and with very good looking players .
I do n't know what exactly happens but in every World Cup the atmosphere changes , everybody gets happier , Mc Donalds launches the tastiest hamburgers , people go out to watch games with friends in bars or they meet in somebody 's house .
I love the World Cup despite the fact that it being in Brazil has brought a lot of political problems , or just show us how corrupt our government can be with the huge overpriced projects , a lot of money that has been spent on unfinished stadiums , with shameful delays in their construction , etc .
I love the World Cup , however i certainly would have preferred if it had been in another country .
I love to run because I think it is good for my mental and physical health .
Just running 30 minutes a day , you can improve your physical activity , lose weight , and improve your brain .
Also it helps you to release the daily stress and is a good motivator .
Everybody needs to know about the benefits they can get from running .
You start walking 10 minutes each day , then for 20 minutes and you can add more minutes till start running for 30 minutes and then for an hour .
The best place to run is a nice spot close to the park .
You just need a pair of running shoes and clothes appropriate for the weather .
In winter , you need to put on heavy clothes , while in summer lighter clothes , a hat and pair of glasses will be all you need .
It is very important to put some sunblock on your face , neck and hands .
In winter I go to run for half an hour in the afternoons , but in summer I go out and run in the mornings and in the afternoons to enjoy the nice weather .
Sometimes , you feel that you do n't want to do it , but believe , once you put on your shoes , things change and you enjoy the running as you do it all the time .
It started a few years ago when I was a little overweight .
Being a person that loves sports , it is hard for me to see gaining pounds through the years .
Once I decided that I needed to do something , I started walking around my place .
After three months , I was running faster and the pain in my heels disappeared .
I was still out of breath sometimes , but I kept doing it because I wanted to achieve my goal to lose 10 pounds .
After six months I was running almost 2 miles each day .
And now I am running 4 miles a day .
So , do n't be lazy , get up and start running .
It is a great journey that is worth it !

Scout ( Jean Louise ) Finch is a round character .
She is the narrator of the story .
Her outter look seems like a little girl .
She is dark haired , very thin and small .
Talking from the outter look , one can easily see that Scout is not " the usual " girl .
Scouts character is kind of a tomboy .
She does not like to dress like a lady even when aunt Alexandra tries to make a lady out of her , Scout refuses to dress or speak like one .
From the outside to her inner qualities .
Scout is a really smart girl .
In young age , before she went to school , she started reading .
Her intelligence in young age was a Problem for her teacher Miss Caroline , because never had such a well - educated pupil before .
Instead of celebrating it , she somhow inhibits Scouts learning .
Due to that Scout gets bored and starts to hate school .
Furthermore Scout often reacts very impulsive , mostly in young age .
She goes after Walter Cunningham after she gets in trouble on his behalf .
Also when she had trouble with her cousin , because she called Atticus a " nigger - lover " Scout beats her up .
In the first part of the novel , fighting is a technique that works for Scout .
For her it is a method to make her mind clear .
Later on Scout begins to understand , not least because of her father and brother , that it is important to think before talking .
Somehow she reverts back to her old ways .
To conclude Scout is a smart girl with two sides .
On the one hand Scout acts very impulsive and is an obstreperous tomboy but on the other hand she is very clever and more adult than others in her age .
Scout always develops the story .
Dear Ali ,
How are things with you ?
Are you still working all the hours God sends preparing for your exams ?
I 'm sorry I haven't written for ages , but I was very busy with the school project I had to do this month .
Thanks again for all your help .
I 'm very glad I can finally do something for you after everything you 've done for me .
So you need information about my country 's eating customs ?
Well then , let 's start with the time we eat and what we eat at those moments here in Holland .
On weekdays , Dutch people take their breakfast , which usually consists of a few sandwiches , somewhere between 7.00 and 8.00 a.m. In the weekend , we tend to sleep in and therefore take our breakfast a bit later .
Around 12.00 a.m. , most people have lunch , which also consists of sandwiches and is just as light as breakfast .
When the clock strikes 6.00 p.m. , it 's time for dinner , the only warm meal of the day as well as the heaviest meal of the day .
Let me also tell you something about traditional Dutch meals .
The most important ones are probably hotchpotches : mashed potatoes and vegetables , often combined with smoked sausage .
In my opinion , some of them are absolutely revolting .
A traditional Dutch meal which I think is far more tasty , consists of little thick pancakes , served warm with melted butter and icing sugar .
Those pancakes are called " poffertjes " .
They can be eaten any time of the day , for breakfast , lunch , supper ...
Whole generations are brought up with this dish , yummy as it is .
Is this enough information for your project ?
If you want to know more about Dutch eating habits , just write to me , and I 'll write back , giving you any other information you might need .
Anyway , I really need to stop now , since I have got to get down to my homework .
All the best with your project ,
Suzanne
My favourite way to travel is most definitely by plane .
There are many reasons why plane travel is the way to go .
First , on a plane , I can get to my destination much faster .
This means I can actually go places .
In a few hours time , I can get to some far - away destination .
I can make it a quick trip , too .
I can go to Paris for a long weekend , for example .
The plane will get me there quickly so that I can have
go shopping , eat some lovely French meals , drink lots of wine and return before work on Monday .
Boats trips are long and boring .
I went on an Alaskan cruise in 1997 .
It was freezing cold and most of the time we
were just sitting on the ship with nothing to do but eat .
I also got sea sick .
I definitely do n't recommend it .
Trains are also boring , unless you take a bullet train , and I get motion sickness .
Therefore , when it comes to speed and being able to go places , planes are definitely the best type of transportation available .
I highly recommend a plane trip as soon as possible .
In today 's intercultural world , one of the best assests people and nations can have is tolerance and a deep appreciation of cultural values different from their own .
No wonder most training includes intercultural communication and cultural awareness courses .
However , it is probably a truism that reading about or watching films about a country are only pale subsitutes to actually going to visit a place and experiencing the differences yourself .
And the longer you stay in a place different from what you are accustomed to , the more opportunities you have to really understand what makes people behave a certain way , what they really like and dislike and how their community works .
It was a calm evening .
One could almost feel the silence .
It was as if a huge storm was coming .
No one in the neighborhood had a clue of what was about to happen in the next few hours .
All of a sudden there was a loud voice that echoed through the neighborhood , and one can almost imagine the silence shattering like a glass .
People started emerging from their houses , their faces stoned with fear .
Not knowing where the sound had come from , they were pulling out smartphones from their robes and jamming their fingers on the screen .
Almost all of them were heard shouting in panic " There has been a terrorist attack in our neighborhood " .
But there was only one who knew what and where that explosion had occurred .
He was in disbelief , flabbergasted , never expecting that the person living next door would do something so heinous .
Just a day before Michael was arguing with his friends that Rasheed was a very nice guy .
Well educated , open - minded , a liberal at best .
So what if he originated from the Arab peninsula , that does not implicate that he is a terrorist .
He has been living in the U.K for the past 20 years .
But this act was out of question .
This was something that could not be argued upon .
Not knowing what would be the intellectual thing to do , the first thing that came to his mind was calling the police .
After briefing the call respondent about every detail that he had known about Rasheed .
He darted towards the backyard , jumped over the hedges .
Sprinted towards what seemed like flames , only to find Rasheed standing across it , blood protruding from his right hand .
In just a split second the whole incident was explained .
What Michael thought to be a terrorist attack was a gas cylinder exploding .
First came the confusion and then remorse .
Knowing that he had jeopardized his friendship with Rasheed he quietly returned to his house .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Shopping can be seen as the most effective way to spend free time .
Whenever there is a possibility to buy a new item , one should follow it .
Shopping became the way of life for some people , who find it as a hobby as well as pleasant activity .
However , it is not always enjoyable .
Sufficient to say , buying new items may be viewed as a waste of time .
Shopping without purchasing anything tends to be exhausting .
There is also a possibility of buying unnecessary items .
Often , it turns out , that purchase should not take place at all , the reason being lack of money .
Nonetheless , the value of time is as important as money .
The main reason for this is the fact that free time could be spent in a more sophisticated way .
Likewise , the joy of shopping is dependent upon the items one intend to purchase .
Obviously , shopping for food is not equivalent to purchasing garments .
The article " Stairways to Heaven : Gothic Architecture , Heavy Metal , and the Aesthetics of Transcendence " is an unparallelled one in terms of the discussion it evokes .
The author starts his discussion by discussing his particular passion for the Gothic architecture , and this passion is rather vivid throughout the entire article .
In order to explain the nature of the Gothic architecture and its major aspects , the author efficiently employs the musical analogies .
One of the major arguments in the article is the comparison between Gothic architecture and Heavy Metal Rock music .
Bork believes this very comparison to be an efficient one , as it employs the parallels that are easily understandable for a wider audience due to the utilization of simple terms that they can relate to .
Furthermore , he finds that there are many similarities between the development of Gothic architecture and Heavy Metal Rock music .
For example , the purpose of both is to induce awe and , they both employ the concepts of distortion ( Bork 1 ) .
What is more , these styles usually tend to abandon the classical tendencies , and both rose in a response to a new demand in the culture .
The public transport system is overburdened today .
The number of people accessing public transport far outweighs the number of people the transport system was designed to handle .
The trains and buses are crowded , and newer routes and not reflecting the changing demand .
Mass production has made cars more affordable to the middle class in recent years .
Also , the increase in disposable income has given more buying power to consumers .
Both these factors have led to increased purchase of cars over the last few years .
This trend is likely to continue in the near future .
Public transport can not rival the sheer mobility that cars offer to their owners .
Cars have the ability to take you from your home to your place of work , without any stopovers .
If you have to take a train , you have to reach the train station by walking , taking a taxi or taking a bus .
Further , after you board off the train , you again have to find your way to your destination by either walking or using another mode of transport .
Cars make it easier to transport children and luggage .
They are safer and cleaner .
Cars are here to stay .
The same , however , can not be said about public transport .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
She took a heavy sigh of relief as all the panic was finally over for her !
Her cherry red face glistened vigorously in the golden brown sunset like a perfectly baked pastry , as the last of the sun 's rays beamed down over the horizon .
Stepping through the crisp autumn leaves , Alison could hear them crackling and crunching under her feet , filling the night with sounds from the past .
At this point , the vivid strands of grass were hardly visible ; the darkness had covered them like a blanket on a new born baby .
Finally , after a few minutes of walking , Alison approached a tree .
She sat down in the freezing cold night shivering nervously as she watched the mud from the ground stain her obsidian black leggings .
In the distance was the sound of panting , it came like a gust of wind in the still silent night .
In the blink of an eye , a small dark figure sped over to Alison .
It jumped around ferociously as if everything was just a game and that is when Alison realised things were now so much better than before ...
Choosing a favorite season would be difficult because they are all special to me .
They each have something to offer and are unique in every way .
Winter is one of my favorites because it is so beautiful to see everything covered with a white sheet of snow .
It also cools you down from all the heat left from the summer and into the fall .
You have fun with your family making snow angels and have snowball fights .
Spring is a good season because it is between winter and summer , temperatures are not too cold and not to hot .
You are comfortable wearing a light jacket outside instead of a heavy warm coat .
You can walk and smell the flowers beginning to flourish .
The birds start chirping early in the morning .
It lets you know that summer is near and so is summer vacation .
Summer is great because it 's time to hang up your shoes and relax .
There is no more school and you can go to sleep late and wake up late .
Relatives visit or you can visit them .
You can also do some traveling and explore new places .
Relaxing in the pool on a floating lounge chair enjoying cold lemonade is the ultimate experience .
Autumn is also a great season because of all the colorful leaves falling even though they are a hassle to pick up , especially in the pools .
You can have fun walking with friends and admiring the different shades of colors on the leaves .
The different colors warm your soul .
Autumn is such a calm season .
The leaves turn beautiful tones of yellow , orange , and red .
Everyone is starting over with a new class , a new teacher , and some new friends .
When you drive by the neighborhoods you notice that families are all gathered in some kind of celebration .
You get such a warm feeling .
It 's such a peaceful time .
Now you know why I can not choose one of the seasons .
All of them are special in every way .
I love them all .
I 'm just glad I get to enjoy every single one .
Dear Sir ,
My name is Natalia Maciejewska Quiñónez and I am a citizen of Castellón .
I am writing this letter to inform you about a serious problem that we are having in the city .
Recently , things have been disappearing from our homes .
We have called the police , but they ignore us .
The first few days , they patrolled the city and helped us .
However , now it seems that they do not care what happens .
The police should help and make sure that we are safe , right ?
That is why I am writing this letter , to make you know what is happening in the city and to tell you that the police are not doing their job .
I would like the local town council to help us find out what is happening .
People are afraid and we need help urgently .
I would also like you to talk to the police department , because the police have to do their job and make sure we are all safe , not to ignore us and say that everything is fine when everything is wrong .
Thank you ,
Natalia
I had never felt so nervous ... I looked in the audience , everyone was looking at me .
On the left side I saw my parents , okay , inhale , exhale , I can do this .
I have always dreamed of this , being a musical star on broadway .
I conpeted in singing competitions when I was younger and I took acting classes .
My parents always supported me , they always believed that I could do this .
I arrived in New York a four months ago .
When I was taking a walk through the neighbourhood I saw this poster about the musical wicked and they were looking for someone to play the lead .
Of course I took this opportunity and two weeks later I had to do audition .
I felt like I messed up but the next day I got a call that I got the role .
I trained weeks for this , I took extra singing and acting classes .
I did n't speak for days to spare my voice .
And finaly , the moment was there , the opening night .
My friends and family were there to support me .
I put on my costume and walked on stage , I had to wait untill I opened the curtains .
Suddenly the curtains opened , the show started !
Many people still consider television only as a way to relax , get entertained and stop thinking about all the problems that might worry them .
It is also important , though , not to underestimate all the educational possibilities that it gives you , as sometimes you can learn more from a documentary than from a school book .
What emerged from the discussion we had in class , is that plenty of students spend their free time watching useless reality or TV shows , procrastinating instead of studying for school .
As it is a very common phenomenon between teenagers , schools should show them that television also enables you to learn something new .
A clear example is that watching television in another language is of vital importance if you aim to learn new vocabularies or improve your comprensive skills , and it makes studying a language really fun and enjoyable .
On the other hand , it is difficult to focus and pay attention while you are in front of a TV screen .
Getting distracted is extremely likely , therefore people watching educational programs may end up switching the TV off or turning over to another channel , as a good movie or any other entertainment is way more appealing .
Had I choose whether considering television educational or not , I would definitely say it is .
Nevertheless , we should use it in an appropriate way and be careful about what is the sources of the information told during a tv show , as they might be misleading .
Dear Mr. Leader ,
I 'm glad I met you and your group of overseas students .
I 'm sure that you wo n't be disappointed with town I live in because there is a lot to see !
I 'm really into showing you all the interesting places around .
To my mind , you 're probably totally exhausted because of travel and those few first days when you had to get to know new surroundings .
So , as you asked me , I 'll give you proposal of an interesting place to visit where you could take a rest and relax .
Kachl 's Park is a perfact place to spend some time walking along paths , sitting on a bench , talking to each other .
In the public garden there are two ponds ( really nice place to sit and admire landscape ) , an antique wooden church , a swimming pool .
There is also quite big concert hall where , if you have luck , you can enjoy some interesting concerts ( in general for free ) .
I think it 'll be perfect place where you can spend some free time .
I can show you around the place and tell a bit more about the city .
I can also recommend other places worth seeing in Bytom .
Write to me back as soon as you decide when you want to go to the park . I 'll go with you with a pleasure .
Take care ,
Wydra
Dear Sir or Madam ,
when I saw your advertisement I instantly thought that I would like to work in one of your summer camps .
My name is Seraina Fennstermacher , I live in Switzerland at the moment , although I grew up in the U.S. I have two children myself , and I always liked working with children .
Since my younger child moved out last year I have a lot of free time , so I would love to spend the summer working in one of your camps .
I am an outgoing and happy person and like to be around people .
Since I used to work as a secretarian I feel capable of organizing sports and evening activities , if you choose to let me do so .
Even though cooking is not my favorite chore I would n't mind to work in the kitchens .
After this short description of myself I would just like to say that I have only heard good things about your summer camps from my relatives in the U.S. , so it would be my pleasure to work for you .
I hope to hear back from you ,
Yours faithfully ,
Seraina Fennstermacher
Dear Sir / Madam
I am writing to you with concern about the U - turns your party have made in broke promises .
We believe none of the promises your party made were brought into action .
It was said you would stand up for elderly and ill people but nothing had changed .
Security against terrorism atacks were promised to be step up but policemen are not seen in the streets and neither are security cameras .
People were counting on this party to increase public expenditure , but pension 's money have stayed the same .
People really need these improvements and you only gave them fake hopes .
One of the most disappointing topics is that you played down the situation we are living and the necessities people has .
We were told this party would speak out against corruption , but now it is your own policy , and promises seem they were a bad joke .
You made huge U - turns by raising taxes and changing your policies .
We look forward this letter will make you back down and apologize to the ones that vote for your lies .
Fortunately , we discovered the real policy this party has and is really coming under fire .
People are noticing your promises are not going to be made and I am sure there will be plenty of people complaining about the lack of true in your promises .
Yours faithfully ,
Lara Calvillo
Line of Duty , a powerful and gripping drama that gets the nation talking
Line of Duty is a British police drama , created by Jed Mercurio , about the investigations of AC-12 , a controversial Police Anti - Corruption Unit .
A large list of characters appears through the episodes , being the common thread that connects the two seasons the regular ones : Martin Compston ( as DS Steve Arnott ) , Vicky McClure ( as DC Kate Fleming ) and Adrian Dunbar ( as PSupt Ted Hastings ) .
Therefore , the first chapter features Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott , a high - flying counter - terrorism officer , who is recruited to AC-12 after refusing to collude with his colleagues in the cover - up of a failed operation in which a man was mistaken shot by another cop .
He 's one of AC-12 's leading investigators although he sometimes has the tendency to let his personal feelings sways his professional judgement .
Fleming plays his partner 's part , an AC-12 's undercover specialist , who prides herself on being the consummate professional , unmoved by emotional considerations .
Both of them share superior , Hastings , who remains the ethically upstanding senior investigating officer ; zealous and suspicious , not being everyone 's cup of tea .
Even though being widely recognised for his impeccable ethical standards , he hides a drastic change in his personal circumstances .
Their scenes are repeatedly stolen , though , by the real stars of the show , the officers who are under suspicion of corruption : Lennie James ( DCI Tony Gates ) in the first season , and Keeley Hawes ( DI Lindsay Denton ) in the second one .
With calculated precision , the plot hatches a story where there are no goodies and baddies , and throws in a few twists and turns that makes your mouth drop -indeed , Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates has adopted a set of particular ethics principles and nevertheless , he 's adored by his loyal team , has got a nice family and has recently been awarded " Officer of the Year " .
To conclude , those who ultimately felt miserable after the end of the spellbinding second season need not worry ; line of Duty writer Jed Mercurio has been commissioned by the BBC to write third and fourth series and if you haven't tried it before , you 've just about got time to catch up .
Were you a UK tourist coming to Switzerland for a short weekend break fifteen years ago you would have found yourself in a situation that no shops would have Sunday opening hours .
I clearly remember bringing milk and bread over from Heathrow in Sunday morning !
But the situation is completely different now !
Now you can shop on Sundays although your shopping spree still will be limited to Zurich railway station and the airport , not to mention some limited choice of simple foods at occasional motorway services .
But it is an improvement to say the least !
Although the size of an average supermarket in Switzerland will still remind you of a medium size village shop , there has been improvement there as well !
We can see now international brands we are used to in the UK .
One can choose between organic and low - fat products , some of which are produced far from our shores .
But the prices will shock and surprise you , they double or triple the UK ones .
Not a good experience for ill - hearted !
If you have strong neves , do your window shopping in Bahnhofstrasse in Zürich .
But do not go in !
You can find the same stuff in Italy at half price !
The old house looked abandoned .
Sarah got off her bike and looked through the window .
She immediately noticed that the glass was broken , probably shattered in pieces by those boys who invited her to play with them at the mansion .
Sarah was not exactly the coolest girl in the school but she came anyways , thinking that maybe for once she would be accepted in their group ... but no one was to be seen behind that window .
Sarah could have never imagined that the sneaky boys were hidden inside the abandoned house waiting for her entrance with eggs and tomatoes in their hands , ready to smash them onto her face .
She was just about to open the door to check the inside when suddenly a scream echoed from the house , the door slammed open and the group started running at full speed chased by four big spiders who just discovered that their home had just been occupied .
Sarah peeked through the door and immediately realized the evil intentions of the group . "
I guess that what goes around comes around !
" she shouted to them with a smile on her face , with this story to tell she will finally shut those boys ' mouths at school .
Something was wrong !
She was sure about that .
She knew her husband better than herself and had noticed his strange behavior for a while .
Usuallly he was energetic , full of confidence , ready to party .
But not any more .
He was absent - minded all the time , he did not listen to her and when she asked him a question , he just shrugged his shoulders or wrinkled his nose .
Maybe they could not avoid the seven - year itch .
Maybe he had a mistress .
But she had no intention to give up .
She had fought to hard for this life and she would not let their long - standing relationship to be ruined just like that .
They met each other nine years ago .
By accident he thought .
Accident which had been well prepared by her .
She always planned her steps carefully .
Her mother was a shy woman who did not know what to do to escape from poverty and even though she had two or three jobs all the time , they did not know if they would have somewhere to sleep the next night .
So he was her escape .
He was well - off and funny .
He was not stupid but you could not expect any perls of wisdom from him .
He had never worked but they had been living in a 40-room house with a huge garden and so many servants that she could not remembered their names .
They had never worried about money - all bills were paid by his trust found .
Who would want to lose this kind of lifestyle ?
So she decided to ask him straight away .
" Are you having a mistress?",she asked one morning when they were having breakfast .
He had not seen that coming and became white as a sheet , raised his eyebrows and just exploded .
" How could you even say that ? I would never ever do this to you . "
At that moment he was like a bear with soar head .
She wanted answers and to have them he needs to be alive not dead of heart attack .
So she tried to calm him down .
" What is going on than ? And do not lie to me ! You have always been a very bad liar ! "
He held his breath for a second , pursed his lips
and then words just slipped of his tongue .
" We are broken .
We do not have any money left .
So I have found a job " .
" Are you kidding me ? You have never worked in your life .
What can you possibly do ? "
" I am a porter .
Every morning I went to the port and unshipped .
Nobody there knows me so you should be afraid that some of our friends would recognise me .
Nobody will never know that we are poor now " .
It was her turn to hold her breath .
She was just numb .
He was strong as an ox , for sure , but working as a porter ?
This should be some kind of joke .
He was waiting for her response .
She had always been level - headed and tried to come up with a plan .
" We can move to smaller house or fired some of the servants ? "
" That is impossible ! What would our friends say ?
And where I would put my wine collection ? I would rather work as a porter than live in a 20-room house "
They definitely had different idea of poverty .
But before clearing that she wanted to ask one more important question :
Where , for God 's sake , had the money gone ? !
It was a cold winter afternoon in England when Michael was born .
Since he was a little boy people around he knew that this child had a strange character .
He was really moody and he could move from extreme happiness to the most absolute sadness in a few seconds .
When he grew up he struggled to pass his illness and he became a sane , strong , handsome young adult man .
However all people in his neighborhoor feared him because of his past .
Michael had always felt alone and he was fed up with that situation .
Therefore , he decided that he was going to meet new people for beginning a new life .
At the age of twenty years he achieved a job as a personal trainer where he earned enough money to rent a flat .
In this way , he moved to his new neigborhood where everybody respected him .
One day he fell in love with one of his female customers .
She was a beautiful , blond , tall , Polish girl called Magda who worked as an architect in a studio in the center of London .
Their relationship had been excellent since first time that they had met each other and two months later they decided to become lovers .
Michael 's new life was working out for the best but it is very difficult for anyone to escape from his past .
Although his life was perfect , he began to feel sick and sad and he remembered his past life when he was a child .
Slowly he became illness one more time .
Although he had been trying to hind this , his personal problems were ovbious and Magda did n't feel well with him .
Finally their relationship broke up and Michael fell in his illness deeper than ever .
Three months later Magda was walking with her new boyfriend and Michael saw them , he was totally insane and jealous , he caught an enormous stick from the nearest tree and he beat them as strong as he could .
The attack lasted two endless minutes which were full of suffering , blood and pain .
The young couple of lovers fell on the floor and Michael got away to his home .
His insane evil mind go away until his flat .
At that moment everything changed , he reminded his childhood , his recovery and his sane life , then Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
In my opinion public transport is doomed , because travelling by car is much more convenient and at the same time the easiest way to reach any destination you wish to get to .
On the one hand , public transport is slow and uncomfortable .
People have to sit next to other people they do n't know for a long time , in other words , you may be sitting next to suspicious passengers .
Pickpockets are frequent and you might end up being robbed , losing your money , credit cards and personal ID card as well .
On the other hand travelling by car allows you to establish your own pace , even when you travel to a place you do not know so well .
This means you can set the time you want to leave , because you do not have to respect a specific timebable .
Furthermore , you can choose an alternative road , rather than taking a main road .
This way you will have the chance to have more relaxing journey through the countryside , traffic will not be so intense and aggressive , and finally you can plan the time you want to arrive , using a GPS or other technolology to help you plan your journey .
To sum up , travelling by public transport can be advantageous when you travel inside a town , but when you have to travel outside your specific territorry , nothing is better than a car .
Michael has been working very hard , and just seemed to really be over whelmed by all the work he had been carrying out through the course of the month .
Well on this particular morning , Michael seem to be getting along quite well , he appeared to be energetic and very vibrant that particular morning .
His attention to detail appeared to be trust worthy and correct , and normally his attention to detail is not something that is challenged because of how reliable he is .
Well as the day was coming to a close Michael had a distinct feeling that something just was n't correct but he dismissed that feeling and continued with his day as he usually does .
Well the days responsibilities in Michael 's mind had been successfully accomplished and he felt really confident about all he had accomplished .
Needless to say Michael could n't have been any more deceived than he had realized , because the unfortunate thing is that when he was doing his walk through on all of his department the inventory that was supposed to be submitted was in fact inaccurate .
Because after Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Dear Jane ,
How are you feeling ?
You sounded really stressed in your last email and I am worried about it .
Are things getting better today ?
I know you are under a lot of pressure because of your final exams and I can really understand how you are feeling right now , buried in a mountain of books and notes , with no free time for other things or just relax .
I 've passed for all this thing .
Do n't you remember how you cheer me up when things could n't get any worse ?
I think you should take a break .
Nothing is worth than getting stressed out about .
If you can study in short bursts and take some breaks , you 'll be by far more efficient in your studies than slogging away for hours on end .
Think of it !
Another thing that it helped me a lot was doing regularly sport near home .
Jogging or going out for a walk helped me to boost energy levels and to clear my mind .
It really works !
What about your meals ?
I think it 's very useful - and right now I sound like your Mom - is eating properly .
You should forget fast food like McDonald 's hamburgers !
Try to eat fresh food , such as salads , tons of fruit and you 'll feel better .
Believe me !
Seriously , if there 's anything I can do , please let me know .
I 'd love to hear from you and maybe we can make some plans to meet up .
Take care and do n't let it you down !
Lots of love
Ainoa .
What are the values of young people nowadays ?
To answer this question , the first thing to consider is if young people really have sincere values , or on the contrary , if they are only simple copies of a current model of a fake society which imposes unattainable stereotypes on them .
Nowadays there are many teenagers who lack their own identity .
They spend all their time thinking only about money , social networks or fashion .
Nevertheless , far from arrogance and vanity , we can still find some young people who have interesting personal values that are used by them to define their lifestyle .
Some values such as solidarity and empathy , that were believed lost , can appear surprisingly in the personality traits of many young people today .
In addition , these personal values joined others such as courage , curiosity , imagination and the sense of adventure , are important aspects to consider and they can become very effective weapons to change the world if they are used suitably .
Considering all this , nowadays it is socially important a development in positive values among young people such as respect and tolerance to create honest adult people .
The 21st century has given a new meaning to the word Friendship .
From what evolved as a comradeship between 2 people based on acquaintance , mutual interest and companionship it has moved forth to relationships where people have not even met one another physically .
In the past friends were made when peopleet each other , other than of course pen friends .
Today with technology friends are made at a click of a key be it on social media or mobile devices .
Friendship was nurtured and we took time to do activities with friends and best friends were limited to one or two of the closest associates .
Today with the BFF concept one has a best friend at every nook and corner for different purposes .
Friendship stood the test of time and grow stronger with disagreements fights and misunderstanding , all being resolved and forgotten in the name of friendship .
Today a minute incident can just tear apart a friendship .
We made the extra effort to be friends in the past and it generally worked both ways .
Today friendships are take take take and very few stand the test of time .
Friendship today is friend or friends for each season and reason while friendship of the past has been whatever the situation or time a friend stands through .
I 'm 24 years old , so I belong to the previous generation , when family , school and life in general worked in a different way , from my point of view .
I have a wonderful family , made up of my father , my mother and my two siblings ( a sister and a brother ) , both older than me .
I consider myself lucky because I know I can always count on them , and because they love me as much as I love them .
However , this does n't mean that my parents , especially when I was a child , always told me " yes " and made me do whatever I wanted to .
On the contrary , I grow up with many " no " , and I do not always agree with them in different situations .
But they taught me all the important values and good manners , and I 'm grateful to them for this .
For nowadays I see around me kids who are pleased in everything by their parents : they buy them whatever they want , and behave as " friends " .
I believe that this 's wrong , because by doing so they 're not doing their well .
Parents must be parents , and friends must be friends .
This does n't mean that parents should keep themselves distant from their son ; on the contrary , a son should talk to his family , asking for advice or just to confront each other , because communication is at the base of relationships of every kind .
I just think that each of us in our life plays a role , and that doing parents is not an easy job , but they should try to do their best .
The Miracle resort Bangkok ,
The miracle is an extraordinarily large resort .
Counting 33 stories in the main building it could be the biggest resort in Bangkok
The resort mainly focuses on children , which is in my eyes a good idea .
The focus on children can be found in the huge contribution the Kids Club has on the daily life in the hotel .
You can find Kids Club 's Members everywhere in the hotel , except for your room .
The hotel handles privacy very well and I can guess most of the guests will appreciate it .
However , walking distances in the hotel are way too far for families with young children .
You find yourself walking five hundred meters to the swimming pool .
That does n't seem too far , but when you have small children , you could be walking this twelve times a day .
A quick trip to the toilet changes into a 1 kilometer hike , which is not pleasant when you have small children .
In conclusion , the Miracle Resort is a very beautiful and appealing place to go .
There are plenty of things to do , and the ambiance in the hotel is relaxed , so you can really enjoy your holiday .
A more compact building would be more appreciated by most of the people .
Finding a new job has become a tough task for all the people who have just finished their studies .
So a lot of them go abroad in order to find a good job in better conditions .
Unfortunately , my girlfriend and I need to do it too .
I have finished my degree and my girlfriend is just about to do it .
Our plan is to go to Birmingham with my cousin Daniel who has been living there for 3 years and to stay with him just the time we need until we can find a job and a place to spend there tree months because we must return in October .
As I said before , the main objective is finding a job there , gaining some experience and improving our English level .
I think that it would be quite easy for Montse to find a job but I am quite worried about my opportunities .
If I am lucky I would apply for an interesting job , but I think that I will apply for a normal job such as barman , working on a factory , etc .
If everything goes as expected and we both find a job , we will visit the city of London .
I hope that this adventure goes well because we are very excited and it would be useful in order to find a job when we come back to Spain .
Laura is the new girl in town .
You can tell because eyerybody looks at her like she is some crazy murdering kid .
Most of the students at Laura 's new school do not talk to her they are a little bit too cautious about interacting with her .
Who can blame them ?
They all grew up together and have been friends since their childhood .
Frustrated Laura accepted her new life of solitude outside of the secret society of the others .
But one day she collided with this boy .
His name was Michael .
And she thought that this is her chance to get in , to be one of them .
But Michael was keen on getting rid of her .
He has not spoken one word to Laura but she followed him around since the incident .
One day when she walked him home she said : Okay , I give up !
If nobody talks to me than none of you have the right to judge me .
I do n't want to be a part of your life because if you act like that without knowing me than you do not deserve my attention .
He thought that this was very brave but he had not enough confidence to tell her that .
He opened the door to his home , took a deep breath and turned around .
Good !
We do n't want your attention !
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
" Sense8 " is a new kind of television series that has grasped the attention of millions of viewers from the first episode .
This TV series is presented by Netflix , an online service that allows its subscribers to view any TV Show , anywhere , and in any device .
The first difference when compared to ordinary TV Shows is that all episodes from Season One were released at the same time .
This seems like a small thing but it represents a major change in the way people view TV shows .
By releasing all episodes at once , each user can watch each chapter at their own rate and speed , devouring them all in an afternoon or only one per week .
The series provides an unorthodox view into the lives of eight people that are connected by some sort of magical spirit .
This connection allows them to see through each other eyes , and even control each other movements .
In order to make the series more interesting , the directors decided that each of the eight chosen ones would be in a different country .
This decision made the series extraordinary , with scenes recorded in Seoul , Nairobi , San Francisco , Mumbai , London , Berlin , Mexico and Chicago .
The series provides an amazing window into eight different , and extraordinary worlds , with beautiful landscapes .
To sum up , I would highly recommend this series to anyone interested in science - fiction , but also to anyone curious about different cultures as " Sense8 " provides an unseen view into the lives of eight very different characters , their surroundings , religion , and traditions .
Hi Juliana ,
Thank you for your email .
To be honest , in the questionnaire you send , I could give a positive response to the most of the questions but I do n't consider myself a code expert .
I could n't answer , in particular , the questions about PHP and MySQL .
In JavaScript I have some experience but not in the necessary quality that is required for such a position , I think .
Like I told you , I 'm a web graphic designer , among other , focused more in design and my usage of code is very limited .
If I have to , I search the web for information and implement it but it requieres time .
Perhaps is there some chance of acquiring knowledge during the development of the activity .
About my CV you have , it is up to date and you can keep it , maybe you have some new offer that patches better with my profile .
I am very interested in multilingual jobs , with German , Spanish , English and Italian , related to marketing , IT web - analytics , Customer service ...
Do n't hesitate to contact me if you have some offer that you think could fit with my background .
I 'm always open to new interesting suggestions .
Have a beautiful day .

A Love Affair with Baking
What is it about cooking shows ?
Why is it that whenever Ina Garten , Ana Olson or Nigella Dawson is on , I tend to stop everything that I 'm doing and just get fixated on the TV ?
The Food Network has become my favourite channel I can tune to it the whole day !
It 's so relaxing and very informative , I never get bored .
Cooking shows are fun to watch , but my most favourite shows are those about cakes and pastries .
I really enjoy baking that I often buy books about it .
Cheesecake for me is the simplest yet most sophisticated cake there is .
To make one , just whisk some eggs and sugar , add some milk and a few drops of vanilla and then pour onto a greased cake pan and bake .
After a couple of minutes , take the cake out of the oven and let it cool down .
It 's best served when chilled , so better wait for a few more minutes before diving into it .
To decorate the cake , whip some cream and top with fresh fruit .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to outline some aspects of my experience , such as , with whom I stayed , where I spent the week and what places I visited .
I will also make reference to some suggestions that might help to improve the exchange programme .
Particularities of the exchange
Recently , I spent a week in Switzerland as a part of a students exchange programme .
I stayed with a local family , which happens to be the family of the person that stayed with me when he took part in the same programme .
His name is John , and like me he is getting a degree in Phisics Engeneering in the hope that someday he can work at a research center , such as CERNE , convinientely placed a few miles away from his house .
I strongly recommend that the programme organisers should make interest free loans , available to people wishing to participate in an exchange .
This would allow considerable numbers of talented students to benefit from an opportunity which they would otherwise be unable to take .
Before addressing the question of what is better for young people , I would like to remind that both activities ( spending time on a computer and watching television ) are harmful for children's / teen 's health .
At the other side it 's impossible to imagine our life without computers and television .
With the help of computers young people can meet new friends , find out a lot of information , take part in forums and discussions .
Surfing the Internet needs imagination , logical thinking and knowledge .
Young people are able to choose what they want to watch / read / listen to , and the choice is practically unlimited .
Television ca n't give such an opportunity .
Precisely here is found the crux of the problem .
There are plenty of free sites with content far from morality ; many computer games impose cruelty .
And the idea that , spending time in Internet 's chats young people develop their social skills , is problematic .
I wish it would be so !
But getting used to the Internet 's rules of comunication , they might find it difficult to face up to reality , make friends in the real world .
For my part , I spend a lot of time on my computer ( learning English and working ) .
But when I want to relax I 'd rather watch TV with my friends than loiter away time sitting alone in front of the computer !
This restaurant is recommended to me by my aunt who was working just around the corner of this restaurant a few years ago .
This restaurant specializes in southeast Asian cuisine and it is called The Chai .
Personally , what I love about this restaurant is the ambiance .
It has a unique modern - rustic interior design suitable for any occasion be it a birthday party , family gathering or even a date with your loved ones .
Besides that , this restaurant is located in the heart of one of the most popular cities in southeast Asia , Kuala Lumpur .
I was blown away by the breathtaking view of the city from my window .
From my experience , I feel that the food served in this restaurant is of fine quality not to mention how delicious the food is .
Not only that , I was lost for choices as I flipped the menu as there was a huge variety of southeast Asian food that ranges from Thai food , Indonesian food , Chinese food and the list goes on .
The food on the menu was amazingly not for illustration purposes only as the food they served looked exactly like the ones in the menu .
In my opinion , I think this is the most suitable restaurant for this special occasion as everyone would have a wide variety of food to choose from and just let the view of the city enhance the night .
So as the end of term is getting closer and closer , many students are being stressed out and it is certainly not different for me .
But if you know how to deal with your nervousity during exam period , you can take the success of passing exams for granted .
Firstly , create your timetable .
That is one of the most secure ways to make sure , you will manage things on time without getting any redundant stress .
Place it in the most visible and strategical point in your room and stick up to it .
Speaking of mental and physical health , you should definitely get enough sleep .
Without a mind and body regeneration , you will not be able to learn as fast and as effectively as you would after a good rest .
To kick off your day , give your body enough energy , in the form of proteins .
Also , to activate your brain quicker , go out for a fresh air .
The more oxygen you get for your organism , the easier you will be able to concentrate on anything you do .
Last but not least , the exam itself is the toughest nut to crack .
Focus and go through the given tasks slowly and keep calm .
Mark and leave the most difficult ones in the end .
This method will keep your state of mind assertive and clear .
Good luck with the upcoming exams !
Communication is one of the biggest problems among today 's teenagers .
I remember when I was a kid the only thing I use the phone was to call my friend to play on the street .
The telephone was convenience , something used to help people communicate , to make their lives easier .
Internet changed people 's routine .
Today , the Internet is one of the most effective and efficient ways to communicate .
Telephones changed , technology became smarter and allows people to stay connected everywhere they go .
Although the large number of advantages that Internet and phones give to us , the use of technology affect people 's ability to communicate face to face .
We communicate through our accounts , emails or chats .
We just take turns talking ( chatting is maybe more correct to say ) and most of the times without any aim .
Using messages people forget to use grammar or even make full sentances .
But that 's not the biggest problem .
The worst thing is that people do n't know how to talk to each other , how to make conversation with new people or even though old friends .
Emoticons replace emotions , chats replace calls , usernames replace people .
Nowadays communication face to face is something rare and most of the times accident .
People just take turns talking without putting any purpose or feelings .
Dear John ,
Thank you for your enquiry and your interest to come here .
I will give you some information that should help you during your stay here .
There are't many guidebooks about my city so I will recommend you a place worth seeing .
The most interesting place is the Park of Tradition , opened last year .
The park consists of a complex of renovated buildings .
In the centre of the park there is a shaft which is The shaft is beautifully illuminated at night .
There is also a building which can be considered as an interacive museum .
In a very interesting way you can find somehing about the history of Siemianowice and about mines .
There is a lot of old photos compared with new ones .
You can see how places used to look and how they look today .
What impress me the most is a combination of old elements of the building with glass and bricks .
In that building you can find also a small cinema .
There is also a cafe which serves traditional Silesian cuisine .
During summer park organizes many exhibitions and cultural events .
It 's really worth seeing .
I hope you will find time to visit that park .
Silesian culture offers a lot so I think you will have fun visiting The Park of Tradition .
Take care , hope to hear from you

Basketball- the best sport ever !
I 'm sure you 'll agree with the fact that basketball is a good sport for the body and soul too .
It 's a team gameplay where you have to start and stop like in aerobics .
It burns lots of calories , build endurance and build up muscles .
80% of the game is mental , you have to think what move you should do next what the rest of the team is up to .
As well as being a great way to stay fit basketball can help you to make new friends and make you a good team player .
That 's why basketball is my favourite sport and it should be yours too !
If you are thinking that you should do some sports , you would really enjoy playing basketball .
If you do n't really enjoy playing in a team , do n't worry !
Basketball can be played and enjoyed with as a few as two people even if the official games of basketball require 10 people .
The beauty of this sport is that as long as you got a ball you can spend hours dribbling or shooting on your own .
I think that you should start practicing this sport because it helps you physically and mentally and it is a good way to socialize .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
That was it .
It really was over between him and Marianne .
After years of contemplating between staying with Marianne - who was more or less the joy of his parents ' life , not him , Marianne - for life or leaving and start fresh , he has finally chosen the latter , thinking that it was the right decision to make at that moment .
But now , every second that passed after that monumental moment just made him feel worse and worse about himself , making second thoughts about whether he should have stayed with Marianne or not .
He sighed as he sat down on the big empty couch and remembered all the memories he had with Marianne .
Both good and bad .
Their first date was more or less awkward , which was typical for most first dates in life .
He had taken her out to a five - star restaurant , to which she insisted that it was too much , which got Michael to insist that it was okay .
But all awkwardness aside , it ended with a first kiss .
A tidal wave of feelings sparked inside Michael 's head as he moved his lips along with Marianne 's .
A few weeks later saw the occurrence of their first fight .
Michael had an unexpected late meeting at work that night and forgot to call home , which made Marianne completely furious ; throwing things to the wall , crashing plates from the counter to the ground , the whole nine yards .
After Michael barely calmed Marianne down , they had a mature heart - to - heart , one someone would say was way too late , but at that moment , it felt right .
His mind then thought of their last kiss .
Man , when was that ?
It had to be about a fortnight ago , before he went to Sochi for a business meeting .
It was merely a goodbye kiss , a quick brush of lips before he had to rush to the airport .
A week later , he found that Marianne was cheating on him with a European businessman he did n't have the mind to remember the name of .
It was the unofficial end of the relationship , the decision before the actual talk .
But at that moment , it ended .
But , in life , you ca n't hold onto the past . You have to keep moving forward .
You have to carry on .
And one day , you 'll find the true love that you 'll trust , the one that 'll catch you when you fall , console you when you cry .
You just have to keep looking .
Nowadays the healthy habits of young people are very different than in the nineties .
And we need to know the reason for these changes and what we can do to improve it .
Firstly , it is true that the young people used to do sport daily in any where , at the school or in the street and also they did n't use to eat fast food .
Secondly , many people argue that the society has experienced a great changes in the family life .
Parents work outside the home all day .
Although they want the best for their children sometimes is difficult because they are tired and they tend to prepare junk food and allow them to spend their time on the internet or playing with the game machine .
In my opinion , parents should be concerned for their family 's comfort and should motivate their children to do sport , be in contact with a lot of people and avoid eating fast food .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
However , there was no way he could remember what it was .
He started feeling nervous and dizzy because he knew it was something extremely important .
He decided to get his computer and check his calendar , but it was in his office , which was 8 minutes away by car .
There was no other option , he went to the garage and got into the car .
But there had been a snowstorm and he could n't drive through the snow .
The wind was freezing cold , and now he had to walk to the office , which was a 25-minute walk .
He put on a jacket and a scarf and left again .
Just to make everything worse , on his way to the office , he slipped on the snow and fell on his back .
Peter got there and had to take practically all of his clothes off because the office was like an oven .
He found the computer and checked his calendar which said : Flight to New York , leaves at 6 pm , on Monday the 19th .
And it was 6:32pm . "
Gosh dang it Peter !
You lost your flight and it was a business trip!You're going to get fired ! "
He said to himself as he whimpered .
I 'm going to talk about doctor who , a British sci - fi TV show about an alien called the Doctor who travels through time and space in a police box called the TARDIS ( Time and Relative Dimension in Space ) .
The first episode aired in 1963 and since then Doctor Who has been one of the most famous sci - fi TV shows on television .
Actually , last year was its 50th anniversary and to celebrate it a special episode in 3D was broadcast .
Since the TV show aired the character of the Doctor has been played by 12 actors , the newest one was announced on summer last year , which is when I was visiting London with my family .
It really caught my attention how relevant Doctor Who is in the UK because almost every time I turned on the TV there was someone talking about who could be the new Doctor , it appeared in the news , in newspapers and the day the BBC was going to reveal the name of the actor they even made a special show about it .
However , I really liked experiencing that because I had never seen the media in Spain pay so much attention to a TV show .
Since I was in London , I thought it could visit The Who Shop , it is a shop dedicated to Doctor Who and it has a museum with costumes and other things that have appeared in the TV show .
We did n't have much time to go there because it was far from our hotel so I had to go only with my father while the rest of my family was somewhere else .
If we had stayed more time we would have been able to spend more time at the shop but anyway , I loved going there and meeting other people who also liked Doctor Who and I bought some merchandise from the shop .
When the BBC finally announced who was going to play as the 12th Doctor , many fans got upset about their choice because they thought the new actor was too old and they said they did n't like it .
But hopefully not everyone was like that .
When an important TV show goes through such a big change not everybody likes it , that is why the same thing happened when the BBC announced who would be playing as the 11th Doctor .
Nobody liked him at first but now that he is leaving everybody loves him and wants him to stay .
Actually , I 'm one of those fans who are sad about the 11th Doctor leaving because he is my favourite one , as he was the one I experienced Doctor Who with because I started watching the TV show when he was playing the main role .
Anyway , before the BBC had announced who was going to play the Doctor 's role , the fans had started making suppositions about who could act as him .
Some said that he would be played by others famous British actors but others thought that an actress should play the new role .
I found out about Doctor Who because a friend of mine saw people talking about it online and she told me about it .
When I started watching it I thought it was a bit weird but I ended up really liking it .
Thanks to it I have met a lot of people who share the same interests as I do and I have discovered some of my favourites TV shows .
I like Doctor Who because time travel has always caught my attention , also I like it because the plot is incredible , something that happened on season one can be connected with some of the last episodes .
Dear Sir / Madam
I am writing to apply for the job in summer camps which was advertised in the USA newspaper last week .
As I am studying physical education , I have a lot of experiences of looking after children .
Last year a group of little kids came to university and we had to taught them several games and outdoor activities - thanks to this project , I am able to organise entertaining sports and activities .
I have just completed a 5 years course in English and I got very good marks .
Although I never take lessons in cooking , I cook varied meals at home every day .
I live alone , so no one does it for me .
In my view , I am sure I am the right person for the job - because I have patience with children , I know what they enjoy doing , and my cooking skills are very useful too .
I would be able to start immediately .
I hope you will consider my application - I can be contacted by email at any time .
Yours faithfully , Julieta .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
It was one of those indigo nights , almost as if the Northern Lights were shining together with her happiness .
Her little brother was still sleeping with an empty stomach and eyes still wet .
The world is a deserted place , at least it is for Alison and her sibling .
She 's been talking to him plaintively to put him to sleep , reading him the same old tatty paperback book with one fairy tale only .
And when they had nothing to quench their thirst and hunger with , she used to invent imaginary worlds where they are wealthy and do n't have a thought in the world .
The note was almost illegible but Alison knew .
She has been waiting for that moment all her life .
I 'm ok .
The note read and her tears rolled down her pale face .
At least we are not alone , she said and hugged her brother .
I 'm ok .
She read it at least twenty times , then threw away and prepared her soul for their father 's arrival .
Have you ever travelled by plane ?
Have you or someone you know been to another country , on another continent ?
Most if not all of inhabitants of this planet would answer ' yes ' .
Last century provided us countless opportunities to be more mobile .
We , humans , can say that we live on the planet Earth without being metaphorical first time in all our history .
There are still borders , both on maps and in minds for us to overcome , but the situation has changed drastically in a century or less .
The world of the first half of the XIX century was quite different from that .
Of course , most of westerners already were able to imagine the Globe with relative accuracy , but the picture in their minds differed from the one in ours .
It rather had the same shades with medieval maps that pictured dragons guarding earthen paradise somewhere near the shore of Indias .
By ' shades ' I mean not real colors , but those undertones that our mind imparts to everything it comes in touch with .
China and India were almost of the same accessibility for the ordinary carpenter from Edinburgh as they were for his predecessor five centuries ago .

Since I was a kid , I have started to think of being a teacher .
That 's why I have always been making an effort to enhance my knowledge and experiences for being a teacher in my future pathway .
Since I was in F.5 , when I became capable to teach somebody , I started to be a Korean teacher and a private English tutor .
From these experiences , I discovered that teaching people will never be an effortless job .
As a teacher , I have to be considerate , unbiased , trustworthy and decisive .
I have to try my best to take care of all students and to ensure that the contents are accessible for them .
Apart from that , it has been a good practice for speaking .
As a teacher , I have to talk in front of many students and that fostered me to become a better speaker .
I have gained a lot from these experiences .
As to enhance my knowledge , I tried to grab chance to bring up my English level .
In 2014 , I had completed the ' Let 's Debate ' writing program offered by The Standard and written a total of 4 articles for the ' Let 's Debate ' column of The Standard Student and Junior Standard .
It had been a truly valuable program for me and it brushed up on my English .
Moreover , I had also participated in the Standard Chartered Hong Kong English Public Speaking Contest on 2015 .
Although I was not able to attain any awards in the competition , I gained a lot of public speaking skills from the competition .
These experiences were tremendously memorable to me and it was my honor to take part in these events .
Apart from that , as I believe that languages are the basic channel of communications between people , I have studied several foreign languages to equip myself .
Starting from F3 , I learnt Korean and I attained level 5 in TOPIK ( Test of Proficiency in Korean ) .
I have also been preparing for the level 6 test since then .
Other than Korean , I have also been learning Japanese and Spanish starting from F5 .
Learning languages is indeed difficult and painstaking .
However , I enjoy my journey in learning them .
Not only can foreign languages become a huge advantage to me , it can also bring me satisfaction and gratification .
That 's why I love learning foreign languages .
It is my aspiration to devote my time to the study of English and education .
I would also like to further my studies of various foreign languages in the university .
It has been my life goal to become an English teacher in order for me to make contributions to our society .
Therefore , I have always been willing to be offered the chance to take and English and education related program in my tertiary education so as to fulfill my dream and to accomplish my life goal .
I hope that I can be one of the candidates you find suitable for your university .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing in reply to the article about the usage of mobile phones at high school which was published in your newspaper on Monday 12th of September .
I would totally agree with the idea that children should not use mobile phones during class , but during breaks .
In the first place , it seems to me that it is really important , both for children and parents to communicate in order to organize their lives taking into account the changing schedules .
However , it is also remarkable that there are proper times to talk on the phone , and proper times to learn .
Of course , we all have the right to communicate whenever we want but , mostly , whenever we need .
Using the phone during breaks let the students focus on the lesson and then , have a bit of distraction when they are not there and , what is more , keep parents relaxed because they can communicate with their children and talk about what they need .
That is why I totally agree with Richardson 's modality dealing with this important issue which is present in students , schools and parents lives nowadays .
Secondly , I would like to mention that I agree with the experiment that is taking place in some districts about permitting students use their mobile phones for educational purposes , and what is more , with Richardson 's facing this issue .
Technology is one of the most important parts of our lives , so we should incorporate it to our habits .
Of course , when we are talking about children and education , it may seem a bit complicated since this subject has both advantages and disadvantages .
For instance , it is really motivating for students to use technology in the classrooms .
However , teachers run the risk of losing their responsibility there , and students can lose their educational way looking at the phones as a way of entertainment instead of as a way to make education enjoyable and effective , as you say in one of your paragraphs : " The Richardson decision is a sound alternative to students secretively using their phones under their desk " .
I consider that something should be done in order to balance pros and cons of having mobile phones present at schools because , firstly , students are the ones who must be present and , what is more , their learning process also must be there .
As I said , it is really important that parents can communicate with their children because they are taking care of them and they are their parents , so they have the right to communicate with them whenever they need .
Apart from that , I strongly believe that technology can be incorporated in the classroom , but teachers and schools are the ones who have to control this activity so that it can be positive both for students and teachers in order to make the learning process more motivating and effective .
All in all , I think that schools should not stop taking into account this important subject .
Technology and , mostly , mobile phones are part of children and parents lives , so schools do n't have to ban it , but look for alternatives in order that they do n't make a negative effect in education .
Richardson 's methodology is fantastic and I think that there are more , and it is important that we know them in order to be informed about this important issue .
I look forward to reading more articles about this subject .
Yours faithfully ,
Magali Hervieux .
This report aims to present different advertising strategies for our products according to the type of customers we have .
In addition , I will recommend the best kind of advertising for our needs .
First , to have a successful campaign it is important to know the target market .
A survey about the kind of customers for our product revealed that most of them are young adults .
This means that they are between 20 and 30 years old .
After studying our advertising options , it was found that two of them can be suitable for our purpose .
One way is to put advertising on the internet and use social networks .
On the other hand , we can set up stands in shopping malls .
In order to obtain maximum benefit from this it will be helpful if we give away product samples .
As I mentioned above , advertising campaign must be appropriate to the target market .
I therefore feel justified in recommending that the campaign in shopping malls will be more effective for us .
This is mainly because besides being cheaper customers will become familiar with the product .
In conclusion , we have different options for this campaign .
If we choose the appropriate kind of advertising for our product I can assure you that we will succeed .
Twenty years ago the economic situation was better than the current , so people did n't have to work until late and they managed to give a strict education and to care about their children 's health .
Teenagers used to go out after having done their homework and their favourite hobby was certainly sport .
Now things have changed : parents work full time and do not take up a lot of their children who are more and more alone and uncontrolled .
When home is empty , teenagers feel free to spend all the time lying on the couch , playing videogames or watching awful programmes on TV .
At the same time they gorge themselves with every kind of food they find in the refrigerator .
A sedentary life style and a poor diet lead of course to overweight .
This is a common issue : in fact juvenile obesity is increasing with bad consequences such as premature diabetes or a permanent disease .
Cooking classes would be helpful to teach teens to cook , to enjoy healthier food and maybe to discover a passion .
For those people who want to combine fun and health , a good solution could be the running , which is a free , competitive and complete sport .
In Milan the association Runners from Mars welcomes thousands of runners who compete for charity .
It would be a good way to change a lifestyle !
I normally dream but do n't remember when I wake .
One day dreant that I were a millionaire , I bought a huge detached house surrounded by tall trees in a beautiful city , maybe in a city like Seville .
The house would n't be located in the city centre because of the traffic and the parking spots , but it would n't be situated too far from downtown .
My dream house would have two floors , a big garage and , of course , a blue swimming pool bordered by a beautiful garden full of plants and trees , and with a white path from the outside door towards the porch .
Inside the house , there would be enormous French windows with long curtains and stylish and practical furniture .
Downstairs , there would be 5 bedrooms with big beds , 2 bathrooms , one of them with a Jacuzzi , a beautiful kitchen with an American fridge ( one of those that have 2 big doors ) and a table in the center , where I could eat with my family , and a pleasant living room with two or three large sofas .
Upstairs , there would be games room where I could play with my nephews , nieces and my daughter , another bathroom , a little office to work and to study English , and finally a huge room called " the cinema - room " , with several comfortable seats and a giant screen where my friends and I could see our favourite films .
Dear Caroline ,
First of all , I would like to thank you for offering to look after my house and my bird pet while we go on holidays .
This means a lot to me , you are a wonderful friend .
We are leaving very late at night , but I managed to leave a copy of the key in the reception of the building , you can keep it with you .
I know the only time you have to go there is in the morning , before you go to work , so I would like to ask you to give priority in changing the water for my bird , and seeing if there is still enough seeds in her bowl which , by the way , are in a box next to the cage .
I also left yoghurt and frozen food for you to prepare in the oven or microwave , this way you wo n't have to worry on going back home to have lunch before going to work .
We will be back by the end of the week , so take care and enjoy your mornings with my bright bird , she loves having company so if you could get her to have lunch with you and talk a little with her , she will be happy for the rest of the day .
I ca n't wait to be with her again , I do n't like leaving her for a long time .
Samia
Dear Sir / Madam .
I am writing to apply for a job in the summer camp in the USA .
My name is Andrea and I am 30 years old .
I 've been working with children of all ages for eight years .
I think I would be a suitable person for the job as I love organising activities for the little ones and spending time with them as well as preparing different types of meals .
In fact , I am attending a course to learn to cook well .
Three years ago , I was working as a Spanish teacher in a boarding Australian school .
At the weekends , I carried on a workshop on leisure activities for children in need .
In that place , we worked as part of an incredible team that organised different activities each weekend .
The experience was great and since then I 've always wanted to have the experience of working again in an English speaking country .
I hope you consider me and I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours faithfully , Andrea .
With the rise in time , the entire world has become one concrete jungle .
The human race began from the jungle where he lived amidst the worries and fears of wild beasts and under the illusionary protection of tall trees and now the journey of human race has come to the same scenario where once again , he is living amidst the fears of wild beasts called ' other humans ' and under the ' illusionary protection ' of stalwart buildings that may either collapse due to an earthquake or a terrorist - attack .
This is the world of globalisation where the entire world is one market .
Every person is marketing himself ; is selling himself ; is presenting himself as a decorated gift - item .
This is why , although we have the luxury of extravagant knowledge under our feet because of internet , we encounter complications and complexities in the decoding of our relationships and in deciphering this perennial flow of knowledge .
I , for that reason , certainly agree with the statement of the given issue .
With knowledge and information , things become comprehensible but more complex .
The religion of Scientology is known as one of the fastest growing religions of the world .
It , today , has millions of followers who believe in its philosophy that reincarnation is the truth and a human feels tied - up because of the constant pull of the strings of his past lives .
Interestingly , Scientology practitioners use technology to prove their hypothetical statements , for they have constructed machines that exhibit the working of brains through waves and softwares that question a practitioner and provide him with a solution to his worries .
In contrast to this , the religions that have survived since the earlier times had discreet knowledge , however they had a much deeper impact .
They were simple yet profound , relying on the comprehensible philosophies of forgiveness and karma .
Scientology proves how the acquisition of widespread knowledge hasn't stopped the birth of new religions , however , ironically , it has made the philosophies of life more dramatic with the mysterious complexities of technology .
Likewise , there are many conspiracy theorists in the world who time and again circulate rumours regarding the existence of a secret organisation ( illuminati , for instance ) that runs the world secretly and plots for all the pre - timed wars and terrorist - attacks .
The theorists ascertain that the organisation is part religious and part political ; it rules over the international media , thereby being omnipotent .
Furthermore , they concoct stories and concepts , publicise them while making animated versions all over the internet .
The brilliance of their presentations is so acute that an ordinary man is almost forced to feel enlightened in his ignorance , finally becoming brainwashed .
The same technique is used by politicians , iconoclasts and leaders who pollute the minds of the people through the medium of technology .
They present complex informations so smartly that an ignorant fool feels like a sagacious monk , whence he becomes the follower and a voter .
Thus , by all means , today we have an easy accessibility to knowledge and we have a wide range of resources to allocate and obtain endless information .
Nevertheless , there is a stomach - wrenching mystery and indecipherable codes around that sometimes makes a common man wonder about his vulnerable existence and unknowingly being - exploited life .
I choose option A : I think it is a good idea for children to travel on public transit .
There are several reasons why I support this choice .
First , it is unnecessary to spend more money on school buses because by Grade 5 children are able to take care of themselves and each other .
They can communicate well and are aware of dangerous situations .
For example , if they see drunk or dirty people on public buses , they could avoid sitting near them or report them to the bus driver .
Second , it is a good opportunity to educate them in life skills such as knowing not to sit in priority seats or leave litter on the bus .
In contrast , I think that the parents who insist their children should only travel on school buses protect them too much .
In daily life , many youngsters need to go to school and back by public transportation .
In other words , if parents spoil their offspring then they may become too dependent and incapable of functioning well in society later on .
In conclusion , it is not only a good chance to take the children on an adventure , but also help them become independent young adults .
I think this way can assist them in adapting to society early .

Subject : End - of - year party
The aim of this proposal is to compare the two proposed venues River Boat Disco and Milford Comedy Club and to recommend one based on the survey carried out among the students .
Entertainment and food
Not only does River Boat Disco has its own experienced DJ , but it also has a buffet which is more then appropriate for this occasion .
Although Milford Comedy Club offers a fun night with four established comedians , the only food available is snacks .
However the main disadvantage of the disco is that it ends very early at 10:30 pm , whereas the comedy club is open until 2 am .
Price
The pricing for the disco is very reasonable because it offers the venue , entertainment and food for $ 25 .
Even though the price is $ 5 smaller for comedy club , it is without food and by the end of the night I do not think there would be much difference .
Location
The boat is located at the Crofton Harbour and some means of transport would be necessary to get there .
It would be possible to organize a bus , which would be preferable to going separately by car .
However the comedy club is easy to find and is accessible by metro and taxi .
Recommendation
I would suggest the River Boat Disco because not only does it offer a buffet , but also the people are more likely to converse with each other while listening to music than to a comedian .
" Manjiare Di Roma " - An Italian Restaurant
This Italian restaurant is in Monção and near the school .
It was opened about four years ago by two friends who had previously worked at pizza places .
As you enter the restaurant you are met with the traditional Italian restaurant red towels and a bit of a rustic feel , behind the counter you can see the cooks making the pizzas .
There is a great variety of dishes , from starters to main dishes and desserts , my recommendation is garlic bread as a starter .
As a main dish you can choose anything from pasta to pizza of all kinds ( even chocolate ) .
This restaurant is very affordable , the prices are extremely reasonable , especially if you 're a student , because there 's a special menu called " student 's menu " where you choose two ingredients for you pizza with or without French fries and a drink for about three euros .
Everyone in the staff is extremely nice and very often the owners come to make small talk with the clients .
All in all , I think this woould be the best restaurant for our class to go , since it 's close to the school , it has good prices and a friendly ambience .
Also everyone enjoys Italian food , so everyone would be pleased .
Dreaming about future is like creating an imaginary world , perfect for yourself and the others .
If present does n't satisfy you , let 's take a trip in the future .
I 'm sure you will enjoy the ride !
Year 2064 .
People are living their lives in a way that we would consider it more than shocking .
Everyone is leaving their perfectly " normal " lives in the sky .
You 've read it well .
Their houses are floating in the air .
It is amazing .
Because of the lack of space , people had come with a brilliant idea of creating these floating houses , they are made of a special type of glass and have a spherical shape .
By finding this solution , they have more space to work on earth and they even protect the environment .
Not to mention the huge advantage that people are protected from earthquakes because these houses do not have direct contact with the earth .
This idea is more than brilliant !
When it comes to their jobs , people work on earth , like oldtimes .
The way they go to work is worth knowing .
They have cars , not like the cars people from 2014 were used to , but they still call them this way .
These cars can go down to their destination and then , go up again until the driver pushes a button .
This button is called " find me and come to me " .
The name says it all .
Once the button is pushed the car finds the driver and literally picks him up .
The streets look all new and improved .
Lots of the buildings are skyscrapers and the architecture has completely changed .
People are still human beings and act completely normal .
They seem happy with the way they live and embrace the change in everything .
overall , this is an image of the future .
Now let 's return to the present because we have a lot of work to do if we want to live in that kind of future eventually .
I read your advertisement in the Cloud magazine and I consider it an interesting experience .
I 'm an Italian native speaker aged 27 and I 've been studying Sport Science at Milan University .
In 2012 I got the Cambridge first certificate in English and I 've been improving my French to pass the exam .
It 's six months since I started teaching gymnastic in a primary school near Milan and I discovered that children are more competitive and honest than adults and I appreciate this .
I am also aware that they are reckless , so I recently attended a First Aid course , which has given me the confidence to deal with emergency situations .
I always try to motivate them with some educational play and I make them understand how important it is the group .
The school will be close in Summer , so I 'll be available from the 15th of June to the 30th of September .
For references , you can contact the Principal of the School , who will be happy to supply you any information .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you and I thank you for your attention .
Taking a gap - year before starting a university is a lifetime opportunity for lots of people .
It 's a time to develop yourself , to travel , to find friends .
You can also spend that time working and saving money for future years on university camp .
It is the only time in your life to do that , to be honest .
After you finish studying , you will have to immediately start working unless you want to live with your parents for the rest of your life .
But the year right after you finish high school is a perfect time to find yourself , to decide what you want to do with your life .
You can go on a road trip around your country or travel somewhere very distant and learn things you 've never heard about on your own skin .
It could also be potentially your last chance to spend so much time with your high school friends .
You will definitely part your ways during college and this way you can make memories that will last for a lifetime .
I think everyone should take a year off after leaving school .
You only live once and wasting such a great possability is unthinkable .
Over the last decades , the spread of technology in our daily life has marked the beginning of a new era .
Computers , mobile phones , the Internet have undoubtedly changed our way of thinking and behaving .
But can we safely regard this technological advance as a proper achievement of modern times ?
Certainly , computers and similar devices give us the priceless opportunity to make our lives simpler .
From booking a flight to videocall a distant friend , anything seems very handy nowadays .
However , the main drawback of such advance is that we now rely more on computers than on our capacities .
We are slowly but inesorably loosing readiness to solve problems , unless we can surf the Internet , so that even a single day without technology would turn out to be a nightmare .
How many times in the last ten years have we given up GPS and used a common paper map for a trip ?
Just a few , right ?
Reality is that the fast - paced world we are currently living in is stealing us our own time .
Nobody gets lost anymore , nobody discovers something on his own .
We all walk down the same path because this is how it is meant to be .
We consult Tripadvisor , we die for positive ratings and we increasingly forget to care about simple things .
In my view , we should all riconsider the role that computers have gained in our lives .
Technology is not reality and should never replace it .
I had never felt so nervous before in my life ... !
It was the last year I was attending the high school and final exams were approaching faster than I thought .
Suddenly a plethora of concerns filled my head up : what to do after the school ?
What are my plans for the future ?
I did n't know anything at all .
The only thing I knew was the date of the exams was becoming more threatening as time went by .
And finally , as for all , the day arrived .
The most stressful day of my life for sure .
I remember I began to bite my knuckles because of the tension , and also because of a girl near me who could n't stop crying nervously ( it 's a pet peeve of mine , I have to admit it ) .
Then when finally it was my turn I seated in front of the teachers and , slowly , I introduced my speech .
Fifteen minutes later it was all over and I felt a brand new person .
After this event I can cope with everything !
As it was said before , the brief time of observation does not allow obtaining that much information about how CLIL is really implemented in a particular educational context , even so the data collected and the following conversation with the teacher , contributed to obtain an interesting picture about how Arts and Crafts is considered and carried out under CLIL umbrella .
CLIL implementation is always a challenge for the teacher , but it seems to be even more difficult when talking about subjects as Arts and Crafts which are more based on the acquisition of skills and the development of another language , the artistic .
How to provide student with more real and relevant input , in the daily routine of an art class , seems to be a dare for Arts and Crafts teachers , who need to bring together the development of the artistic language and the learning of a foreign language .
Despite the difficulties that CLIL teachers have to overcome , the truth is that the atmosphere of CLIL lessons is in some way special .
What surprised me more positively was the level of peer support , the cooperation and the comradeship .
It is interesting to see how the students resort each other looking for help in a natural way , without the intervention of the teacher .
Peer support is something that teachers expect and promote in all subjects , but it seems to emerge more genuinely when talking about CLIL atmosphere .
Dear Sir or Madam ,

Many people have the impression that learning a language is only possible through hard work : studying grammar rules , learning vocabulary by heart and burying your head in a book .
However , there are in fact several methods that you can employ should you want to become a linguist .
In this essay I will discuss two of these : the immersion method , and the classroom method .
Firstly , the immersion method takes its inspiration from the way in which we all learnt to speak our nature tongue : implicitly .
With this method , learners are simply exposed to the target language , either by going abroad to live in the country where it is spoken , or by having a native teacher .
There is no explicit focus on grammar ; instead , the learners are expected to " absorb " the language and its rules .
This method has its advantages , as it is the way we all learnt to speak , and so it is arguably more natural .
Another advantage is that students are unencumbered by overcomplicated , confusing metalanguage .
Secondly , the classroom method is the one with which most students ( especially if they are older ) are familiar .
Learners are normally taught in their mother tongue , and are given grammar rules , which they then apply to the language they are learning .
This method also has its benefits , not least logistically speaking , since many students do n't have access to native speakers or are not able to travel abroad .
Furthermore , some learners respond better to an explicit focus on rules , which make them aware of the mistakes they are making .
While both methods clearly have their advantages , I believe that just limiting students to either one or the other can have a negative effect on language learning .
Having a native speaker will give students maximum exposure to the language , while at the same time a focus on rules will give them the tools for self - correction and self - study .
I fully believe that this combination method is the most effective way for students to learn English .
Now we are going to evaluate the main charactheristics and differences between a pellet stove and a pellet boiler .
Let 's start to focus our attention at the pellet stove .
The diagram shows a compact structure and the simplicity of the machine ; it has three main sections : the feed section , the combustion chamber and the blower(i.e .
fan ) .
In the first conic part it is possible to feed with the fuel ( i.e. the pellet ) that leads to the combustion chamber where the pellet will burn to generate the heat necessary to warm up the air .
Beneath the combustion chamber there is the ash tray necessary to collect the ash generated by the combustion of the pellet .
As mantion above the heat is necessary to warm up the air that , thanks to the fan , will be blown out to the room in order to warm up the external ambient ( e.g. room , bathroom , kitchen ... ) .
This is a pretty compact machine but it 's not very efficient and very clean .
Actually , it produces a high amount of pollution such as ash and exhausted gas that contains micro- and nano - particle .
Let 's focus now on the pellet boiler .
The structure is pretty much the same as the pellet stove , the difference is that instead of a fan here we have a pump due to the fact that the goal of the boiler is to warm up water and send it to the heaters all over the house , so it 's nedded a pump to do that instead of just a fan ( the pourpose of a fan and a pump it 's the same : move fluid from a point A to a pont B , but in one case you have to move air and in the second case water ( they have a different density : water has 1000 times the density of air ) .
Like in the stove there is a feed section where you can feed the pellet that will go directly to the combustion chamber ( according to the control system ) in order to burn it and generate the heat to warm up the water .
Now , thanks to the pump the hot water is able to reach the upstairs rooms .
Basically the two rely on the same methods : burning pellets to warm up a fluid ( air for the stove and water for the boiler ) .
My home town , an international city , attracts millions of tourists from all over the world every year .
Knowing a clean and tidy city is no less appealing to the tourists than beautiful scenery and bargain shopping , both the authority and the citizens understand the need to keep our city clean in order to keep the tourists coming , therefore they are serious in protecting the environment .
To keep the city clean and tidy , people adopt an environmentally friendly attitude in daily life : they refuse littering , if they can not find a rubbish bin around , they keep rubbish in small plastic bag ; at home , they separate the recyclable items from the rubbish before they get rid of the rubbish .
They follow the government 's advice to set the air conditioner temperature at 25 degrees of Celsius .
The government plays a crucial role in taking care of the environment .
It build sewage sites for the disposal of the city 's waste .
It educates the citizens to cultivate their sense of protecting the city 's environment .
We are lucky to live in a city where both the authority and the people have a strong sense of environmental protection .
We are sure that the tourists who visit our city can feel it and hope that they will help spread the message when they go home .
Among a variety of sports , there is the football also known as soccer .
Football can be played either as a hobby or as a job .
Since I was very young , roughly at the age of thirteen , football became my favorite sport and it was an activity that I could never stop doing .
As the time passed , I became more skilled at football .
I signed up for a feminine football team in my city .
Our team trained twice a week for about two or three hours .
We had our own trainer , which was a man who played football before .
There are three main reasons why I enjoy playing football .
Firstly , it is a way to get out of the routine , occasionally .
It helps to release the endorphins and anxiety levels in my body .
Secondly , it has helped me to improve my health condition in several ways .
For example , it contributes to my cardiovascular system .
And thirdly , it is an activity where I have been able to make new friends who , besides playing football as me , are very similar to me in other features .
If any one you would like to start practicing this dynamic and amazing sport , I would tell you to try it as soon as possible .
As you get involved with football and you enroll with this sport , you will clearly notice the benefits it brings to your daily life .
So , give it a shot and you will realize it is one of the most amazing activities you can ever do .
' The letter that changed my life '
' I think we 're being followed ' said Sara to me , as we pulled over the street .
We 'd had a lovely meal in one of the most charming restaurants in Rome .
Despite the fact that We 'd had to share a table with others tourists , we 'd had a great time .
Sara had left our hire - car keys on top of the table and had paid no attention to them for a while .
When we were about to leave we realized that there were a short letter on the table . ' I have your car keys .
Wait for me , please ' it said .
We did n't understand a thing because the car keys were just in front of us .
So we rushed out the restaurant on suspicion of theft .
We 'd been driving for half an hour when I noticed that there were a white car behind us .
Sara tried to get rid of it but the white car was still there .
We pulled over the main road .
The other car driver came up to us slowly .
We were really afraid . '
You 've had the wrong keys and the wrong car ' said the man .
As soon as the man explained everything to us we realised that we had mistaken car keys in the restaurant because both of them were exactly alike .
We exchange addresses and as time went on we became good friends .
I ended up working to Mr Smith ' company in Madrid where I 've been working there for 20 years .
People seem to be living quiet comfortable lives nowadays .
We have reached an age of high technology .
Humans will most likely continue to improve this technology and make their lives better for the future .
We might live better lives in the future .
When thinking about how the lives of people will be like in the next 50 years , the first thought that comes to my mind is a person sitting lazily on a sofa that can adjust itself to his / her will .
The reason for the laziness is that the work of the house will be done by robots .
This is how I think life would be in the next 50 years .
Robots will continue to be improved , till they will be able to do all work at home , so no one rich enough to afford a robot would bother to do the work himself / herself .
The robot will be able to do things like cooking , fetching , washing clothes and dishes and cleaning the house .
The men would only do the paperwork themselves .
However , not everything about the life in the next 50 years will be positive .
Water is already growing scarce over time .
Eventually , it might become so much of a precious resource that it will be used as the international currency instead of dollars .
We will have to find an alternative drinking source ...
Shopping is my favourite pastime , and I simply can not imagine anything more relaxing and joyful than spending my hard - earned money .
But with a heavy heart I have to agree with this statement .
Why ?
There might appear a few situations , when shopping instead of joy can bring a headache .
First of all , it is quite hard to enjoy shopping when you are forced to do it .
The best example here could be the regular , every - week filling - the - fridge shopping , which in principle can not be pleasant .
Personally I am not able to find anything exciting in hanging around extremely high supermarket shelves and pushing heavy trolley . Crowd in every corner , awful and unpleasant lights and the necessity to run from one end of the market to another , because these shops are organised in the way , which forces you to see everything , in order to find what you really need .
That and the extremely long queues for the cash desk also are not very encouraging .
What is more I hate do shopping when I really need to buy something .
Because there is this wicked , unwritten rule , according to which if you are looking for something , there is not the slightest chance you will get it .
You will not be able to find the right size , the right colour or simply anything which would suit your taste .
Shopping with your husband , boyfriend , father or any representative of the male kind , also can totally ruin the most fruitful shopping ever .
I believe they are genetically programmed to take away all your ' joie de vivre ' .
The constant grumbling , regular checking the time , this anxious and adrift facial expression - how on earth it could create a favourable conditions for shopping ? !
And believe me there is no difference if you are shopping for yourself or for them , it always looks this way .
In conclusion , shopping can be and usually is a great opportunity , not only to expand contents of your wardrobe , but also , to relax and spend a great time .
You just have to avoid supermarkets , buy clothes in advance - so there will not appear the situation , when you need something really badly and it is not in your closet , and of course of the male company , better choose the female companion .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I saw your advertisement and would like to apply to work in the USA in one of your Summer camps .
I have a good working knowledge of the English language and I sat my FCE exam last year .
Since then I have attended a course for the preparation of the CAE exam , and spent two weeks in Ireland during the Summer working as a babysitter , so I have had experience working with children .
I love facing new challenges and am available to work long hours if required .
I also consider myself to have great organisational skills .
This can be noted in the fact that I was head of entertainment in my High School for two years .
During these two years I was responsible for the organisation and booking of bands .
I would also describe myself as a fun , energetic person .
I love learning new skills and although I 've never worked in a kitchen before but I 'd love to try my hand at cooking .
The bell rang and all the students left the class .
I quickly took my things and went out of the classroom hoping to arrive as soon as possible home .
But before I could leave school I remembered that I had left my trainers in the changing room , just after football session .
Ten minutes after I had already taken my trainers and closed the gym door when I saw her walking towards me .
I started walking towards my house when she yelled :
-"Michie!Wait for me ! "
Oh no , not again ... That stupid girl was completely in love with me , since last year she thinks that I like her , but she 's wrong .
And although she knows I hate the way she calls me , she does n't stop doing it .
She 's an impossible woman .
-"What do you want Stacey ?"-
I asked her .
-"Don't be angry Michie , I know you love me .
I only wanted to tell you that Joe is going to make a party in his house tomorrow at 8 p.m. and I 'll be there "- she said
-"Thank you for the information . Bye "- I said , knowing what I was n't going to do tomorrow .
Half an hour after I arrived home .
I heard a voice behind me saying :
-"So , you 'll be at the party tomorrow , right ? "
I thought it was Stacey again , trying to get into my house again and trying to seduce me .
And I yelled :
-"I'M FED UP WITH YOU ! STOP .
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN ... "
-"Ok , got it . Hope you get on well with your problem " .
And Cass , the girl I 'm in love with slammed the door .
I was feeling confused and bad .
I went into my house and closed the door knowing at that moment that I had made a mistake .
To whom it may concern .
My name is Richard Raya , I am 35 years old and live in the Basque Country in northern Spain .
I would like to apply
for the position you recently advertised regarding Summer Camps in the USA . I also have
plenty of experience with teaching younger children .
This experience involved tutoring children from the ages of 5 to 16 in various aspects of English and Maths
in a one on one role .
Without knowing it , I was preparing myself for a position like this one , such as working
as a Surf Instructor during the summer holidays in my home town of Zarautz .
I think I am very suitable for this position as I really enjoy working with children and have a wide variety of
skills in sports and also a fun loving attitude towards organising activities .
Cooking is one of my favourite
pastimes , when I cook it 's usually for a big group of friends , so preparing meals is actually something I
really enjoy .
I have many references from employers and the parents of the children I teach .
If I am selected for an interview
I am available at anytime as the summer holidays are upon us .
I look forward to your reply .
Kind regards ,
Richard Raya
The best sport ever .
Do you practise any sport ?
If so , you will know all the benefits but also effort that it takes .
I love dancing and I do ballet , which requires a lot of discipline .
I started dancing when I was six years old , my mates and I were so cute with our little dresses and tiny feet doing slow movements .
For me it was n't funny at all so I always tried to skip my classes , and I finally did n't go back the following year .
But seven years later , as a teenager , I found ballet really feminine and I decided to start again .
I think that this is not a usual sport , but it has the same advantages : it burn calories , improve circulation , is good for the bones and muscles ... Therefore is a really beautiful way to exercise and help you to improve flexibility .
My advice for people who would like to start dancing ballet is : do n't be afraid , it does n't matter if you are seven or seventy , if you want to do it you can .
So let 's do it !
Dear director ,
I would really like to participate as a co worker in this summer camp .
My mother told me that I can gain great experiences .
Whereas in my opinion , it is way more than that .
By looking after children between the ages of 8 and 12 , I can experience new skills that will be useful in my future with my future kids .
I am very energetic , cheerful and hardworking , which are the traits you are looking for !
I have always loved seeing my mom cooking and the fact that you have this in the camp just makes me happier .
On the one hand , I have never worked in the kitchens before .
On the other hand , I think serving within this area is the best opportunity for trying new abilities .
I am also a great organizer ; therefore , I can be such a great help with the evening and sports activities .
I hope you understand my point of view .
I am really looking forward to being part of your camp !
Let me know your opinion whenever you are ready ,
Elisa .
Over the course of history , life has constantly changed .
From the early nomad tribes , to the first human settlements , then to villages and cities to the formation of civilization , man has never stood still for too long .
Key discoveries have changed the course of history .
First , the fire , then agriculture , irrigation , and nowadays with technology .
The more knowledge we accumulate , the faster progress will come .
Mankind went from a rural based society to a modern skyscraper - filled civilization in just a century .
And we will continue this process for as long we exist .
The discovery of electricity has increased our productivity greatly .
Instead of just working during the day , man now could continue working during the night .
Factories could have long working hours in order to produce more .
People in turn started to consume more due to the increased workforce and the greater offer of products .
The quick and practical life in the city started to drive thousands of people away from the fields .
With the advance of electronic products , information has become even easier to spread .
First with the radio , news about events happening far from your local community could be easily heard by anyone within earshot .
Then with TVs , information started to spread faster and faster until our contenporary instantaneous reports from across the world in the palm of our hands .
Sometimes it seems we have reached the pinacle of existence .
I 'm sure the pharaos of Egypt felt that way when they gazed at the Pyramids .
And yet , we 've come this far .
Now , we can look at those Pyramids from the other side of the world , receiving a live video feed in a device we hold in our hands .
In the next 50 years , who know what we will be able to accomplish .
Education and technology are deeply related , to a certain extent in that education has suffered a series of changes throughout the past 20 years .
In present times it is very common to see people learning courses through a computer .
Online learning has become a modern phenomena in order to gain knowledge ; however , face - to - face learning is still the better learning option chosen by students .
Although there are many differences among these two , similarities can be found as well .
The main similarity between face - to - face learning and online learning is that they both provide valuable learning skills to students .
Currently , exist all types of courses via the Internet , at any academic or vocational level .
For instance , degree courses , master courses or just an updating course can be found .
Adding to this , both learning options require time and dedication from students ; otherwise , knowledge will not be properly delivered .
On the other hand , differences between face - to - face learning and virtual learning are numerous .
Firstly , online learning conveys flexibility in its shedule .
Studentd can attend courses when they decide , but always respecting due dates .
Another difference between face - to - face learning and online learning may be that face - to - face learning allows students to develop human - relationships , whereas online learning is quite impossible on this to happen .
During face - to - face learning students have a teacher - student relationship , as well as a peer - to - peer relationship , allowing them to develop inter - personaal skills and coexistence .
Last but not least , time spent on these courses are different too .
When doing a fece - to - face course besides having an attendance schedule , people spend more time commuting to the place where the course is given .
In current days , traffic jams are a fact in big cities ; therefore a lot of time is lost commuting .
Consequentlu , both learning options have their positive and negative aspects .
Assessing these similarities and differences each student has the option to choose the option which better suits in his lifestyle .
Peschiera Borromeo , a little town near Milan , has an agricultural reality and there are many possibilities to walk around and to train yourself in a running parcour .
Unfortunately there is a lot of traffic , so the best place to avoid it is a little artificial lake called Idroscalo where people can run along the 7 kilometres perimeter or cycling open air while looking at the swans .
In this area you can find many facilities such as two swimming pools , a tennis and a volleyball court .
People can also try canoeing at the local school or the water skiing with a mechanical device that drags you on the water .
It 's really fun !
For those who feel brave , there is also a wall where you can climb with all equipment .
The best season to enjoy this place is certainly the spring , when the weather is not too hot and there are not so many people who picnic under the trees and disturb you while you 're trying to relax !
If you too have got a dog and want to teach him something useful , take him here every Sunday morning and a trainer will teach him how to save people from drowning and your friend will become a lifeguard !
Here you can really forget about the city pollution !
The speaker discusses the article , saying that taxes stand against free trade and in favor of protectionism .
In his opinion the concept of protectionism in the world of global economy is not effective .
There is a good example involving developing countries , which economies have been successful due to being the most opened to free trade , and countries with a low economic growth , that closed themselves off to international trade .
Although in the lecture it is admitted that international competition can cause problems to local businesses , mentioned in the article , he claims that it is worth competing with global corporations , because this way survived local companies may get stronger than ever .
They can hire local people , give them well - paid jobs , and those people may learn how global corporations work , which is a good thing for local economies .
And finally , the article states that free trade does not always lead to peaceful relationship between nations , but the lecturer draws attention to European common market set up after World War II .
He emphasizes that free trade between powerful European nations makes a war between them almost impossible .
To test the research 's hypothesis , self - administrated questionnaires were used on a total of 400 customers .
The target population included telecommunication service users who subscribed a loyalty program .
The choice of telecommunication industry in this framework is related to the vital role of loyalty and retention in this service setting .
Many experts have emphasized the market maturity and the number and variety of competitive choices among service providers .
Following this , all types of service providers focus on customer retention as a source of growth ( Amdocs Market Insight & Strategy , 2011 ) .
A total of 309 complete and exploitable questionnaires were collected , with a response rate of 77% .
This sample size allows us to perform multiple data analysis ( multivariate and SEM ) .
An appropriate sample size should be ten times the number of items used in the questionnaire ( Sorbom et Joreskog , 1982 ) .
In this research , the sample size seems to be appropriate for SEM ( 309 > 27 items multiplied by 10 ) .
A game is an activity involving one or more players .
Games are played primarily for entertainment or enjoyment , but may also serve as exercise .
Everyone in this world has their own favorite sports , so do I. My favorite sport is football .
I often play this with my friend in the evening .
I like this game because it is exciting and challenging .
Football is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players each .
It is a ball game played on a rectangular grass field with a goal at each end .
The objective of the game is to score by maneuvering the ball into the opposing goal .
The winner is the team which has scored most goals at the end of the match .
Football is played at a professional level all over the world , and millions of people regularly go to football stadium to follow their favorite team , whilst millions more avidly watch the game on television .
A very large number of people also play football at an amateur level .
In many parts of the world football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans , local communities , and even nations ; it is therefore often claimed to be the most popular sport in the world .
football player .
I learnt teambuilding , discipline as well as teamwork through playing football .
There are many worldwide international competition of football .
One of the major international competitions in football is the World Cup organized by Fédération Internationale de Football Association .
Over 190 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals .
The finals tournament , which is held every four years , now involves 32 national teams competing .
The next World Cup takes place in Russia 2018
The star I admired most in football is Edson Arantes do Nascimento , nicknamed Pelé , is a former Brazilian football player and thought by many to be the finest player of all time .
Often considered the complete attacking player , he was completely two - footed , a prolific finisher , exceptional at dribbling and passing , and was a remarkably good tackler for a forward .
He was also famed for his speed and strength on the ball .
Since his full retirement he has served as an ambassador for the sport .
There are many reasons as football is my favorite game .
I wish to become a professional football player .
Holidays are mostly about relaxing therefore I disagree with always trying new things .
In my mind , holidays are essentially about being comfortable , staying in your element and simply enjoying your time off and not about creating uncomfortable situations if that might be the outcome of trying new things .
Holidays , to me , are our chance to eliminate stress and panic from our system and improve our level of comfort .
As stress and challenging work triggers exhaustion in many such as myself , I prefer curling up with a good book and enjoying a nice cup of coffee on holidays rather than generating any level of discomfort .
Change is never easy and being able to try new things is indeed a valuable trait for one to have , however I do not have such traits .
On the contrary to the subject I disagree having to try new and challenging things on holidays due to the fact that I take much more pleasure reading novels which make me feel all the rush of an outside activity all the while keeping me safe and comfortable .
A review about medieval Turkey .
I 'm certainly not the only one watching this amazing series . I ca n't call it a soap opera because it 's so much more than that .
It 's a love story between Turkey 's most famous and cruel ruler of all times and his main wife .
I wrote main because back then Turkish men were allowed to have harems .
It 's the story of Suleyman the Emperor and his wife , Hurrem .
Like the title says , the story takes place in medieval Turkey .
The actors and literally amazing .
Their acting is on spot and the costumes and magnificent .
The role of Suleyman is played by Turkey 's most famous actor Halit Ergenc and he 's amazing at it .
What I liked most about him is that he agreed to grow a huge beard in order to get into role .
The actress who plays Suleyman 's wife , Hurrem is none other than Meryem Uzerli .
She 's such a beautiful woman and plays the role beautifully .
The other actors are also really talented and bring to life many of the historical figures that Turkey had in that time .
I strongly recommend this amazing series to people who want to take a glimpse into the history of a fascinating country and experience different feelings together with the main characters .
Foreign language learning in my country
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to comment on the way people , and especially children , learn languages in my country , what foreign languages they learn and where they learn them and to recommend changes in the language - learning system .
Languages people learn
There are many languages people in my country learn , but English would be the most popular as it is a world wide language .
With Germany and Austria being our neighbours and thus business partners to many Czech companies , German is the second most popular foreign language spoken , followed by Russian , French , Italian and Spanish .
Who learns languages in my country
Mostly , it is children at schools who learn languages .
They start learning English or German at the age of eight .
Other language of their choice follows at secondary school .
However , there might be a problem with the choice as not every secondary school offers e.g. Spanish or Italian , so students have to choose a language they do not prefer .
Students at some schools also have a possibility of exchange programmes but these can be quite expensive and not every family can afford such an event .
There are also many adults who want to learn or just improve their language skills .
Adults usually attend language courses , or use a variety of on - line courses .
Recommended changes
I would recommend the government to increase salaries for Spanish , Italian or French teachers to persuade them to teach at schools instead of giving private lessons .
It would also be wise to donate schools that prepare exchange programs for their students , so that more of them could afford that .
Dear Mr Williams ,
I saw your advertisement for language courses in London and I am writing to find out more about the courses you offer .
I am thinking of attending a course for two or three weeks in August .
Could you please send me more information and details of prices ?
I would particularly like to know how many students attend the school , and how many students there are in a class .
I 'd also like to know what resources the school has .
For example , is there a library where I can study in the evenings ?
Could you tell me something about the staff ?
Are they all qualified teachers ?
I would be interested in having more details of the social and sports
programme .
Are the activities included in the price of the course ?
Could you tell me about the cost of accommodation too ?
Also , can you tell me what amenities there are near the school ?
For
example , is there _ park or cinema nearby ?
I look forward to receiving your reply .
Regards ,
It would be great if all of us have a healthy life .
However , young people generally do n't pay enough attention to their health and fitness .
There are many young people who follow Hollywood stars or famous singers and want to have the same bodies as them .
As a consequence , they become slim and they do n't ingest enough proteins and vitamins to have a healthy life
On the other hand , teenagers are becoming more dependent on cellphones , video games and television which make them being more sedentary .
Being always on the bed or on the sofa is not recommended , whereas going outside and run or ride a bicycle would be a better option .
This way they would be doing physical exercise .
Finally , to be healthy it is also important to eat balanced food .
Snacks , fast food , fried food and sweets are part of young people 's life as they can find them everywhere : in the shops on the street , at parties and in shopping malls .
In conclusion , young people should behave differently towards their health and fitness .
Being sedentary and eating fast food will not bring them anywhere .
The statement is rather too categorical , because to say that there is no future is going too far .
It is true though , that public transport would not be the general public 's first choice .
Sometimes the reasons for doing so are not to do with convenience but , rather more to do with economic issues or matters of conscience .
If we think selfishly , then the car is the obvious choice .
It is easy , fast and , we can almost park it right outside our destination or at walking distance -shorter rather than longer .
It is initially expensive but it is so handy that we end up thinking it is part of us and even think we can not live without it .
Raising people 's awareness of pollution and how we must have a more sustainable existence is what makes us look for other less selfish and handy options .
Publis transport is always going to be slower , less flexible and much less convenient but we have the reassurance that we are doing what is best for our planet .
We are complying to the norm .
In conclusion , public transport will always have a future if local governments have policies to promote it .
It is never the attractive option , but it is the one which shows more solidarity .
Government jobs carry with them serious responsibilities .
It is therefore no surprise that a person 's age and experience come under scrutiny when positions in government need to be filled .
Many feel influential government jobs should be reserved for those who are older and have more experience , while others feel the criterion for these positions should be capability , namely whomever is most able to carry out the job .
This essay will look at both sides before drawing a logical conclusion .
On the one hand , many argue that younger people should be made ineligible for important government positions , and the implications of this opinion are clear .
Those operating at senior levels within a country 's military , for example , require field experience to prevent disastrous decisions that could cause the needless loss of life .
Were younger people allowed to fast track their ascension within a country 's military , they could find themselves having to make critical choices based more on theoretical study than practical experience , and this could have catastrophic results .
Thus , is it understandable why many feel younger government workers should be incubated before given promotion to important positions .
However , there are several plausible counters to this argument .
For one , younger workers bring creativity and fresh ideas to government .
For example , young government workers in Canada successfully pushed to increase HIV understanding and dispel stigmas attached to the disease in the 1980s , a development that encouraged tolerance and reduced irrational fear .
In addition to fresh ideas , it should be remembered that to get a government job , one has to successfully engage a rigorous screening process .
If a younger person engages this process as well or better than an older person , it is hard to argue that age should be a decisive factor when offering employment .
It is clear from these reasons that there is merit to awarding important government career options to younger people .
Although the above look reveals solid evidence for both sides of the argument , it is felt that the healthiest approach to designating government positions is to ensure candidates fulfil rigorous training programs .
Thus , a person 's age should not be considered a universal precursor to the awarding of government jobs .
Promotional Objective :
One of the promotional objectives is to increase the awareness of Trivago in Hong Kong .
In order to achieve its objectives , Trivago invested more money in the promotion in 2014 .
For example , it promoted their search engine by the television commercial and Youtube advertisement .
The Youtube advertisement means the viewers have to be enforced to watch the advertisement before they watch some video in Youtube .
Since most of the people watch the television not just a few minutes or do not just watch one or two video(s ) in Youtube , they will be enforced to watch its advertisement more than one times .
Trivago has a very simple and rememberable tagline which is ' Hotels ?
Trivago ' .
The audiences are easy to think of Trivago when they are thinking about hotels .
Also , Trivago wants to increase its market share by entering Hong Kong Market .
Many Hong Kongers love to travel and go to different country to feel the culture and enjoy the different lifestyle .
Many of them try to plan the cheapest way for their trip include booking the worthiest hotel .
If they aware the benefits of using Trivago , they will love to use this as they could spend less time to compare all the hotels .
Therefore , Trivago use the advisement to increase its market share in Hong Kong .
Moreover , Trivago is trying to enhance the company image in Hong Kong .
Trivago is not much common in Hong Kong .
Some people even probably do not know what it is .
If Trivago want to gain benefits from the Hong Kong market , it has to develop and enhance their brand image .
Doing promotion is one of the ways to improve its image .
Trivago is trying to represent that it is the most convenient hotel search engine in the market .
The last but not the least , Trivago wants to boost its download rate in the mobile application platforms .
Almost all the advertisements are encouraging audience to download its mobile application .
If there are more people download its mobile application , it means more people to know its brand and use its service .
Current advertising strategy
We found one of the Television advertisements which is currently undertaking in Hong Kong .
The advertisement is about 16 seconds .
There is a narrator introduces the function of Trivago and demonstrates " how to use its mobile application to search for a worthiest hotel . "
At the last of the video , the screen shows a tagline and the website of Trivago .
We will analyze its strategies from different perspectives below .
Television Commercial
In general , television is the most popular media in Hong Kong .
Advertising by television is an effective way to communicate the service to the general public .
Since that television is able to reach a large number of people during a short period of time , more potential customers will be exposed to its service .
If the advertisement is designed well , people will remember it .
Moreover , television has the advantage of being able to utilize sight , sound and motion .
Combining a catchy theme tune and a well - designed visual advertisement can increase the chances of viewers remembering the brand .
This also allows for more creative options .
As designers are not limited to using only sound or still images , they can create advertisements that are appealing visually and audibly .
Background Music
Music helps stimulates sense and focus attention toward the advertisement .
The background music in the advertising is relaxed and excite .
It can make people feel youthful and it matches to the taste of young adults which are Trivago 's target customers .
Besides , music also has other benefits .
It helps audience to better recall the advertisement and stored it in long - term memory .
It can also increase the retention of visual information .
Demonstration
The television advertisement shows the service being using .
It demonstrates all the steps from searching the hotel , choosing selection criteria and comparing the price to different hotels .
Through the demonstration , Trivago can show to the audience how easy to use its mobile application to find a worthiest hotel .
It can enhance its creditability as the audience can clearly to know what its service is .
On the other hand , as a mobile application , some people probably feel confused about how it operates .
Therefore , with the visual effect , demonstration is the most effective way to teach the audience to use the mobile application .
Informative
The television commercial presents information to the audience in a straight - forward manner .
The narrator directly indicates the functions of the mobile application .
For example , he says the application can instantly compare the rates to over 150 websites .
For those who are high interested in hotel searching service , they may notice to such informative advertisement .
Cognitive Strategy
In the television commercial , Trivago uses cognitive message strategy .
It clearly presented that its searching engine can help the customers to compare the price of over 150 websites of hotels in the world and find the most worthy hotel .
This is a testable claim and Trivago can use it to be its unique selling proposition .
This strategy shows its profession and reliability for its target customers .
At the same time , it increases the confidence of the customers for choosing its services .
As Hong Kong is a new market for Trivago , it needs to enhance its popularity in there .
Before 2014 , Trivago is not famous in Asia .
It needs to utilities some strategies to increase its brand awareness and the information about its services toward its customers in order to achieve the promotional objectives .
Conative Strategy
On the other hand , Trivago also applies conative strategy in the advertisement .
In the television commercial , the narrator tells the audiences to download the Trivago mobile application in their mobile phone .
It encourages customer to purchase its services and truly make use of it .
The purpose is to increase the sale and enlarge its market share in Hong Kong .
Means - End Chain
Moreover , " Means - End Chain " is adapted in the television advertisement .
The leverage point of Trivago is providing hotel room search services .
By using the Trivago 's services , customers can search the worthiest price of the hotel room to gain benefit .
Trivago can achieve the personal value for customers through the advertisement .
Some people desire to have a comfortable and pleasure journey with lower prices and the freedom of choosing their favorite accommodation .
The advertisement can show that they are wisdom by using Trivogo service to plan an economically trip .
Mean - End Chain is being used as Trivago is not only to help customer search for a hotel room , but also to achieve the personal value for customer which is worthier than money the customer saved in booking a hotel room .
Trivago use this way to enhance its brand image and competitive advantage since the value of its services is increased .
Tagline
Nevertheless , Trivago designs a tagline in the television commercial .
The tagline ' ' Hotels ?
Trivago '' , can introduce the key idea of the television commercial .
Audience can easily remember the brand name and get a plain awareness and knowledge of Trivago services .
Besides , it can also improve the consistency of advertising platforms .
As the tagline is catchy , if the tagline is continuously applied on the other advertisements , it will not be easy to stray from the main idea .
Other communication tools
Trivago does not choose radio to be their media as it is antiquated .
People currently seldom listen to the radio .
Attention of the radio commercial is low .
Also , radio advertisements only contain verbal effect .
Without the visual effect , it becomes less attractive .
Even through people listen to the radio advertisement of Trivago , they probably do not know how to spell the word ' Trivago ' as it is not a normal vocabulary .
It makes people hard to search Trivago on the Internet .
Therefore , the product awareness driven by radio advertisement is not enough .
Newspaper is also not a good media since newspaper has been recently replaced by online newspaper .
Likewise , Trivago is an online service so Newspaper advertisement may not appropriate for it .
Lastly , hire spokesperson consequent high cost in promotion .
And there is a risk of hiring a spokesperson as he may not bring an expected return for the company .
Sometimes , if there is a spokesperson in an advertisement , the focus of audience maybe shifts from the product to the spokesperson .
The promoting objective is difficult to be achieved .
Therefore , television commercial is likely the most suitable method to promote its brand in Hong Kong .

A group of young boys was once again doing graffiti on the front of his house .
Not even a month before he had paid a fortune to get his place refurbished and painted .
He was fed up with all this profanity .
How many times would he have to face this irreverence ?
He headed the front door in rage .
The moment he reached the street he started yelling at them .
Of course , they all left in a rush .
Jacob remained there bursting in rage .
While he was standing on the pavement tears of resentment covered his face .
No one had ever responded to his demands .
He knew that among his innermost feelings there was a growing icy animosity towards human nature .
He wondered how he would react next time .
A few minutes later , his good next - door neighbour came by to help him to calm down and to collect the art weapons left over by the graffiti vandals .
Have you ever watch a game that involves people running around a field and scoring goals by kicking a ball ?
Yes , it 's football !
And it is also known to be my favourite sport .
I know that for some , playing football is boring but for me , it 's the most awesome thing ever .
I 'm a freak when it comes to football .
I think I had watched almost all the football matches in history especially when it was the FIFA World Cup season .
I would not sleep until the game was over .
Although , I do n't play really well , but I would choose it over any other sports any day .
I enjoy playing football because the feeling you get when you are on the field is priceless .
I would feel free when I 'm in the field .
I was told that I was a natural player when I was young .
I did n't need any coaching since my football skills came naturally .
I think that I got this from my dad and my elder brother .
Both of them are just like me , we freak out when it comes to football !
90% of our conversation includes football and we can talk all day about it for sure .
Here is some advice to someone who is starting to this sport .
Make sure to play smoothly for the first time and make sure to use a football shoe when you 're playing in the field .
This advice is to avoid you from injuring yourself as a beginner in football .
Do you have a favourite sport ?
I 've played tennis for 5 years now and I can assure you it 's one of the best sports any person can do !
Playing tennis means more to me than anything else .
First , whether played individually or in teams , it 's great fun and demands a lot of effort .
Winning or losing is up to you when you play singles , and you know you have to do your best to achieve the best score .
Also , I love it because it takes my mind off worries .
It has helped me to stay focused and improve my concentration , too .
As well as that , tennis gives me the opportunity to stay fit and meet new people .
Since it 's not very easy at the beginning , if you are interested in taking up tennis you should persevere and train at least twice a week .
Do n't forget to buy a good pair of tennis shoes and a fairly good racket .
All in all , I 've practised many sports in my life but tennis 's been far the best exercise for both , my mind and body .
I really get a lot of pleasure in doing it .
Give it a try and you 'll see !
My hero and my foe
Do you know " The Flying Dutchman " ? I consider him as the Dutch Superman of 2013 , since he has won some important sports competitions .
Do you also know Clown Bassie ?
Well , I consider him as the meanest Dutch celebrity of this year .
" The Flying Dutchman " , also known as Epke Zonderland , is a gymnast from Groningen who was the first man worldwide to do an incredibly difficult exercise on the parallel bars .
By performing this exercise perfectly , he became the World Champion this year ( and he also won the gold medal at the Olympics of 2012 ) .
For this achievement , I admire him quite a lot .
Clown Bassie , on the other hand , is an actor of a TV - programme for children .
After a live show , he made a little girl crying by shouting at her and then kicked her in the back .
Why would you treat toddlers so badly ?
To summarise , my hero of 2013 is Epke Zonderland , because of his achievements in the gym .
My villain of this year is Clown Bassie , since I think his behaviour is unacceptable !
Clearly , travel in your own car is much more comfortable than on public transport .
For this reason , many people now believe that there is no future for public transport .
These people believe that ver the next few years we will see a severe decline in the amount of people using bus , trains , trams , etc . to get places .
In my opinion , this is dissapointing for a number of reasons .
First of all , public transport bring us closer to other people .
We share moments with those people using the same mode of transport as us .
Also , it is an excellent way of saving the environment .
By using public transport we reduce our carbon footprint and help to save the Earth .
Furthermore , we also save time : as cities become bigger it becomes more and more difficult to park , which in turn leads to us wasting time looking for somewhere to park , or wasting money in expensive carparks .
In conclusion , I believe that public transport should be a necessary part of everybody 's life , we should use it every day to save the Earth , money , and time .
If you 're looking for a great film to watch on a rainy day , I totally recommend Alice in Wonderland .
It would give you all the magic of a fantasy film based on a book .
Directed by Tim Burton , the story is a retelling of fantasy novel Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland .The film shows a young Alice Troubled by a strange recurring dream , the loss of her beloved father , an unwanted marriage proposal , and the oppressive expectations of the society in which she lives .
Unsure of what to does , she chase a rabbit in a blue waistcoat , and accidentally falls into a large rabbit hole From which she emerges in a forest , where she is greeted by many strange creatures .
There Alice will star an adventure where she must slay the Red evil Queen and restore the White Queen to power .
The film features Mia Wasikowska as Alice .
With her sweet face , pale skin , and great acting , she looks perfect as a confused and brave girl who has to save that " wonderful " world .
But we must not forget about the marvelous acting of Johnny Deep ( as the mad hatter ) and Helena Bonham Carter ( as the red queen ) , with them the film would n't be the same .
But it 's not just the acting that is great in this film .
The cinematography is fantastic , with wonder digital landscapes .
But what really makes it magical is the makeup and the costume design , they really managed to create something amazing with the appearance of characters .
Finally , the film had the great touch of Tim Burton as director .
If you enjoy a classic book , but with more action and a little bit twisted ; watch Alice in Wonderland .
I totally recommend it , you will not be disappointed .
Is science evil ?
People 's opinions on this question differ widely .
I think that science has altered our lives in a positive way .
Here are some facts to support my view .
Firstly , I should say that life nowadays is unthinkable without science .
In the century of advancing communications and technology it is hard to imagine the world without medicine , astronomy , computers , and history .
People today are interested in learning about the surrounding world , about new civilizations and distant planets .
Science explains to us a lot of the things that we previously were not aware of .
Without its help , for example , we would have never realized were we have come from .
It also gives us clues that there may be life on other planets and we might not be the most superior beings in the world .
By using computers nowadays it is very convenient to find the information you are looking for .
There is no secret for the human beings today because they have explored every place on the Earth .
They climb the highest mountains , dive in the depths of oceans , and conduct dangerous experiments and all for the sake of science .
The present belief is that scientific approach will solve all the problems and do away with all difficulties .
With its help , for example , people are able to cope with natural disasters .
We know how to destroy hail clouds which can cause great damage to our crops .
We are also able to protect ourselves from various diseases and help the sick .
That is why science is so significant nowadays .
On the other hand , the greatness of science goes together with its disadvantages .
For example , we are obliged to agree that science has given no answer to man 's doubts .
The obsession to know everything has led some of us to make dangerous experiments for which we pay with our lives .
To conclude , I will only say that science makes our lives easier .
With its help we cope with different situations and that is why it is so fundamental to human existence and I think is not evil .
At some time or another , each and every young person must provide themselves with the necessary skills . « What can I do for my life ? » .
When you start to consider interests and strengths , it makes sense to consider your interests first .
After all a successful career is best measured in how satisfying you find it , and it 's easier to develop strengths and skills than to actually have to learn to find something interesting .
While we are studying we may not think seriously about job .
But in a few years time our job will be one of the most important things in our everyday life .
When someone asks an adult " what do you do ? "
they nearly always reply with their occupation .
Work , for most of us , will be the defining aspect of life and thus of our identity .
Through our work we find an identity , we can find status , intellectual stimulation as well as wealth which enables us to buy comfort .
We can work out our place in the world .
Our working identities can change over time , our identity and behaviours as a young graduate are different from those of the professional expert and from those of the senior leader .
Our ability to develop our identity is critical to our ability to be successful in a range of career roles , we need to shed our old identity and add new elements .
We each have a picture of who we are and what we will / won't do in our heads , once formed our brains garner the evidence that it is a true picture and ignore evidence that suggests that it is not true .
So people say ' I do n't do numbers ' , ' I do n't do detail ' ' I do n't do preparation ' , they believe it and make it true . '
I ca n't do sales ' becomes a self fulfilling prophecy .
We can change our beliefs , actions and thus our identity through experimentation , practice and conscious self discipline .
In an age where career progression may lead us into new environments and sectors it is ever more important to challenge our sense of self and explore whether you can create ' a new you ' by changing the beliefs you hold about yourself and the world in order to develop and expand your career options .
Factors behind the decline
There are more than 200 old , abandoned , local buildings in our capital city .
But most of them are about to be declined by town planners .
This means we will lose a part of our national history .
While the fact that those buildings are not seen as worthy of preservation is an important factor , demolition is more frequently caused by a lack of public funds .
Firstly , demolition is partly caused by how valuable the old buildings are estimated .
Old local buildings often do not provide opportunities to make any money , they only cost town planners a lot of money because they probably need to be renovated .
However , even with these arguments , demolition is more frequently affected by a lack of public funds because it covers the part about the hindsight of an appropriate budget for eventually renovating as well .
With no appropriate budget it is unreasonable to keep old buildings which are useless when they are not renovated .
And above that , without public funds there are too few people who show they care about the fate of historical buildings .
This might cause that town planners will think there are not enough reasons to keep them .
After all , the factor with the most influence on decline of local buildings is the lack of public funds which make it possible to keep our old buildings , or at least a few of them , because these funds frequently accumulate money for projects like renovations .
Any form of public transport like a bus or a train is too much of an inconvenience especially in a large city such as London .
Imagine going to work on a rainy day : you have one hand on your umbrella and the other clutching your bag , the wind is blowing mist on your face and a puddle of water is sprinkling tiny dots of wet dirt in your stilleto while you are making your way to a bus station .
Not a good scene , is it ?
Definitely not a good way to start your day .
Indeed , the method by which a person go from point A to point B can spell the difference between a good and a bad day .
Transportation is very important in our daily life and in this modern world we live in , the very least that we expect from almost anything is inconvenience .
This is why , most of us , prefer to travel with our own car rather than by a public transport ; not only that it keeps us within our private sphere , it also keeps us dry travelling on a rainy day .
Yes , we are willing to spend more in the name of convenience . We 'd rather pay a hefty price for gas than be inconvenienced in a public transport .
Dear Sir ,
My name is Paula Zuidweg and I have recently graduated from high school .
Next year I will be starting the Psychology bachelor programme at the University of Groningen , and I would like to earn some money beforehand .
So when I came across this advertisement yesterday , I found myself thinking how wonderful it would be to apply for this job .
I believe myself to be a suitable person for this job , as I am a hard working , reliable , cheerful , fun - loving person .
When I was 15 years old , I started looking after our neighbour 's children , aged seven and nine .
Those children are too old for babysitters now , but I love children and would really like working with them again .
I believe myself to be a proficient cook , as I 've always cooked for my family in the weekends .
When I was almost three years old , my parents moved to Indonesia because of their work circumstances .
There I went to Surabaya International School , where I learnt English .
Two years later we moved back , but I continued speaking in both Dutch and English to my parents .
I also read books in English , so I think my English is certainly good enough for this job .
My hobbies include drawing , baking cakes , and reading .
I like photography too , although I haven't been doing that for a long time .
I 'm interested in philosophy as well ; I enjoy writing essays about psychological or philosophical subjects , so every now and then I write an essay in my free time .
Thank you so much for your time , I hope you 'll consider me for this position .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours sincerely ,
P. Zuidweg
Fame and the attitude to fame have been one of the most thought - provoking topics .
Students usually find it very inspiring and engaging to discuss this issue because it is very difficult to give a clear - cut answer and so , it makes the process of discussion very exciting .
There may be a significant number of arguments which support the statement that fame is a good thing .
My personal attitude to fame is rather ambivalent .
On the one hand , I personally think that the desire to become famous is a great driving force that stimulates people and brings a lot of benefits to others in its wake .
Sportsmen are one of the most vivid examples of it .
If we take football clubs , for example , we can see that the desire to become well - known and popular makes football players very dedicated sportsmen .
They can fight against the odds to be in the top league .
It is remarkable how much stamina and spirit can be demonstrated by such sportsmen .
Their desire to be at the top contributes a lot to the fame and reputation of their clubs and countries as well .
What is equally important and adds to the importance of fame is that somebody 's desire to be famous can have a triggering effect on others .
It means that other people feel challenged and do n't want to fall behind and look underdogs .
Without this stimulus they may have been inactive .
On the other hand almost equal number of people may maintain a contrasting point of view .
They give examples when the desire to become famous made people aggressive and ruthless .
Such people tried to achieve their goal irrespective of the means .
I can illustrate my words by the example of military campaigns .
The desire of some country 's leaders to become famous and to glorify their names as great commanders brought about wars and conflicts between countries .
Hundreds and thousands of innocent people may fall victim to the insatiable desire of such fame -seeking personalities .
So , all in all , we can not answer this question as " yes " or " no " because there is almost equal number of examples that help to support the contracting points of view .
It was midnight and Susan 's crying was muffled by her pillow .
She could n't believe that he was capable of doing such a horrendous thing .
It was seven o'clock when she got home with her arms full of grocery bags .
It was a strange atmosphere in the house and a chill went down her spine .
She brushed it off and went to the kitchen to put all the groceries on the kitchen counter .
She looked around the kitchen and saw a post - it on the fridge . '
We need to talk ' it said .
She checked the hour , then decided to call Michael .
He was n't answering his phone . '
He might be busy .
He 'll call later'she thought .
She went to their bedroom to change her clothes and start dinner .
She wanted to surprise Michael with delicious pasta and some rose wine .
She went down to the kitchen and proceeded with preparations , but she could n't get rid of that weird feeling . ' Something is up . I can feel it ' , so she picked up the phone and decided to call Michael again .
After three rings , he answered the phone , his breath short . '
Yeah ?
Hey baby ! '
" Hi . Where are you ? she asked , apprehension rising slowly . "
Oh , I had to finish something for work , so I 'll be late tonight . Do n't wait up ' he said and hung up .
She looked at the phone surprised and tried calling him again , but his phone was turned off .
She called his best friend and also his workmate and asked him about Michael , but he had no clue about it , so she decided to go to his office .
The ride felt like and eternity .
She parked her car a few meters away for Michael 's office and walked up to it .
She was about to open the door when she heard a female voice coming from his office .
" What are we going to do ?
This is n't something that will go away in a few months .
I 'm pregnant and we need to solve this out .
What are we going to do about Susan ? " said the unfamiliar woman .
" I do n't know."said the familiar male voice . "
I guess we 'll just have to play this one cool , because I ca n't lose Susan .
You need to understand this . I 'll pay alimony and help you with the kid , but I can not lose Susan " .
she could n't believe her ears .
Michael has been cheating on her .
Full of rage and disappointment she opened the door and saw the woman sitting in Michael 's lap .
Michael was petrified .
Susan looked at him , then at the woman .
She could n't be more than twenty - two .
She looked at him again then turned around and left .
When she got home she packed some of her belongings and drove to her best friend 's house .
After two hours , she could hear Michael 's voice coming from downstairs .
" I need to talk to her .
She needs to hear me out . I wo n't leave ! " .
She heard heavy footprints on the stairs and buried her head deeper in the pillow .
Michael entered slowly and tried to approach his wife . "
Don't!"she said and threw the pillow at his face .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Respected teachers and all my friends
Good morning to one and all present here .
I am very happy to see you all ones again .
I am here today to deliver a speech to you about boycott bullying .
These days we see in the walls written boycott of stop bullying .
Do we know the real meaning of the word bullying .
Bullying may be defined as the activity of repeated , aggressive behavior intended to hurt another individual , physically , mentally or emotionally .
Bullying is characterized by an individual behaving in a certain way to gain power over another person .
It can be classified into four types :
Physical ( hitting , punching , or kicking )
Verbal ( name - calling or taunting )
Relational ( destroying peer acceptance and friendships )
Cyber - bullying ( using electronic means to harm others )
Those who have been the targets of bullying can suffer from long term emotional and behavioral problems .
Bullying can cause loneliness , depression , anxiety , lead to low self - esteem and illnesses .
In conclusion , I would like to say that self harm , low self esteem and bullying are all causes of destruction in our schools . We need to stop this .
We need to do something to prevent it , before it 's too late .
Now to boycott bullying form our school i request all of you to take an oath that , I make a commitment to take a stand against bullying . I will treat others with respect and kindness .
I will have to compassion to not be a bully and the courage to not to be a bystander .
It is my responsibility to help others being bullied and to report bullying .
Thank you
Michael was sitting on the bench of the garden , waiting for his mother to finish her work .
She was a machinist , and was currently working on some secret work he could n't understand .
As Michael heard the sound of breaking glass , he ran up to his mother 's office .
She was on the cold ground , laying like a dead body , her son sat by her side , trying to wake her up .
He stopped when he saw the dark shadow walking to him .
It was a man in his late thirties , very thin and light grey eyes .
An evil smile was drawn on his face .
He raised his hand , whom was holding a metal bar , full of blood .
Michael had no time to scream , he was already laying on the floor , by his mother 's side .
5 years later .
There he was , sitting on a bench in a garden , waiting for his mother .
But this time , he just knew she would never come .
She was not dead , but in coma , in a hospital .
He was in the same state as her for about a week after the drama , and had to live on his own for the years who came .
As he grew wiser and stronger , Michael still always had this hope that his mother would wake up .
But it would never happen , not anymore .
He walked up to her room , where she was comfortly sleeping in her bed .
He sat by her side , and held her hand .
Tonight , she would be gone , he already signed the papers , his choice was made .
He took a deep breath before leaning over her and kissed soflty her forehead .
Full of sorrow and pain , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .

My first memories of food are from my early years , as I looked at my grandmother cooking typical Spanish dishes such as paella or tortilla .
When I was in school I used to go to my granparents ' home to have lunch because my parents were at work , I fondly remember my gandma 's great cooking skills that she still owns to this day .
She 'd cook the best tortilla , paella and all of the typical Spanish dishes that I 've ever eaten .
A few years afterwards , right when I started high school and hit my teenager years , I began eating bigger amounts of unhealthy food from American fast food restaurants that I used to go to with my friends some days right after class and during the weekends .
Those years I was very familiar with the smell of cheese burguers , BBQ pizzas and also kebabs .
By the time my high school years were done , and right when I attended university , I developed certain predilection for typical healthy Spanish , unavoidibly combined with less fast food due to the usual diners with friends .
The main cause of that change was that I had to have breakfast , lunch and dinner at my college dorm 's dining room that had amazingly good cooks , They 'd cook really good dishes such as cocido , garbanzos and paella .
Wonderful inventions such as the train , bus and airplane have allowed us the freedom to travel and explore this great planet for a lower price .
Industrialization gave us the ability to mass produce public transit vehicles so that everyone could be free to move .
Travelling by car may be more convenient on an individual basis but pollution is a danger we have to face .
If all of used cars , the levels of pollution would be incredibly high .
Public institutions should encourage the use of public transport , especially trains as they use electricity and are less pollutant than other means of transport .
There is a problem , though .
Prices of train tickets can be very high and they should be reduced .
Traffic is a really big problem in cities nowadays and only the use of public transport can make a significant difference in the quality of life in our cities .
If those who run public transportation systems hope to make them greener in the future , they 'll have to come with solutions that are both energy efficient and effective .
In conclusion , I think that public transport has an important role to play if we want to preserve the quality of life in our cities .
I believe that my background is suitable for this position .
My first degree gave me a good track record in physiology and anatomy , and the experience , as a biological sciences ' student and as a research fellow , allowed me to build a scientific thinking .
Furthermore , I have improved my skills in molecular , biochemical , bioinformatics and microscopic techniques , and I also would like to point up my high motivation to develop expertise in stem cells and pharmaceutical research .
In addition , I am committed to science and I am a dedicated , team - oriented person , who is able to work independently .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am interested in the English Course in which I can learn at my own pace .
Therefore , I am writing to give you my details .
First of all , I consider very important to learn a second language and English is a very used one around the world .
I need to speak English when I travel abroad .
In addition to that , I am graduated in Computer Science and there is a lot of information available in this language .
So , I need to have a good vocabulary to understand the materials I find on the Internet .
Secondly , I have been studying English for six years . I am good at reading and grammar , but I am conscious that I need to practise my speaking .
I can start the course as soon as possible and I plan to spend 6 months on it .
Finally , I have interest in technology , environment and science .
In my free time , I like to read books and play board games .
I am looking forward to receiving my programme of study .
Yours faithfully ,
Ana Ferreira
I live in a small village , in the German region of Hesse , called Griesheim .
The city authorities have a very strict policy regarding waste disposal .
All citizens are involved in the process by organizing their waste in the corresponding bins and by making good use of the waste calendar .
Every house in the village has three containers :
- One for the paper ;
- One for the bio waste ; and ,
- One for the waste that can not be recycled .
In addition , yellow plastic bags are provided for free to separate the plastic , cans and bricks .
The cost of the waste disposal service depends only on the volume of non - reciclable waste produced .
The yellow bags and the glass are processed at no cost , whatever the volume .
There are also public conainers for glass and clothes all around the village .
Eventually , the citizen becomes part of a very meticulous recycling process by looking up to the cost .
On the other hand , the city provides a punctual public transport system , very convenient .
This system relies on the tram .
Trams are available 24 hours and tram stops are evenly distributed ; it takes no more than 8 minutes walking from one stop to the next one .
The bus network completes the public transport service .
To ride is another suitable option , if the weather allows .
The city is bike friendly and bike paths are available .
Large forests and country roads , where cars are not allowed , are also part of the offer .
Jack and the great , furry waffle .
Jack was a fat , lazy guy who loved food , and he would never miss a meal .
He would only drag himself out of his house when he heard a new type of food was created .
Jack lived with his mommy , he had no job , and when she had told him to be independent , he only lasted one month before going on poverty .
He was really sad because the government was enforcing a law on banning new types of food , this had become a huge problem because more Americans were getting diabetes .
One day before this new law was established , a crazy scientist created a new waffle , " the great , furry waffle .
" This was an incentive for Jack to go out , he was sure that destiny had rewarded him with this blessing because he had eaten ten hot dogs in a row , although he felt a bit sick after , he knew it was worth the try .
There was a bit of conflict in his plan , the new waffle was in Texas , and he lived in Washington .
He knew he would n't last a day in the heat , but there was nothing better than a new waffle .
He saw on his mommy 's television that if he was the first person to try the waffle , he would get a bonus of a hundred bacon strips .
Jack bought a ticket to the earliest flight to Texas , once he got off the plane he ran through the landscape .
He liked the trend of everyone being fat in America , that way he could fit in .
Once he got to the laboratory where the pancake was made , he told the mad scientist that he wanted to eat his waffle .
The scientist gave him " the great , furry waffle " and a bunch of syrup .
Jack grabbed it and put it in his mouth , he could taste heaven in his mouth .
It was a combination of bacon , meat , and cheese with a little bit of butter .
What he did n't expect was that all the hair had gotten stuck in his throat , leaving him unable to breathe !
In a matter of seconds nothing he fell to the ground , choking .
Suddenly , a giant fish fell from the sky , causing him spit out the hairball , Jack could not believe what he saw , the man riding the fish was Bugs Bunny !
Jack finally lost weight and lived happily ever after , the end .
Have you ever stopped to think that exist some standards in the society that everyone knows and follows although some people do it unconsciously ?
These standards are called unwritten rules which can be defined as unspoken rules imposed in each culture to make the population to live more civilly ( Bob Greene , How Unwritten Rules Circumscribe Our Lives - Paragraph 6 ) .
In fact , since the beginning , the written rules have helped to create the civilizations while the unwritten rules have helped to maintain them , allowing life to be more harmonious .
For example I can cite the importance of the unwritten rules in my own culture , the Brazilian culture .
There are some aspects and actions that everyone who lives in Brazil needs to follow , and those directly reflect the values of the Brazilian culture .
One of the most important unwritten rules that you should follow in Brazil is related to the vocal patterns .
When Olquin said that the situation and the environment define the correct tone of speech ( 1995 ) , he was talking about the African American Communication , but he is also describing the Brazilian communication at the same time .
Even though there is no definite consensus about the exact vocal patterns in Brazil , there are some facts about the extremes of it .
First , Brazilians feel uncomfortable when people close to them raise their tone of voice and continue speaking loudly during a long time , without they have clear reasons .
It means that you pretend to transform the dialog in a monolog ; moreover , unknown people in the same environment of you frequently do not want to know about your thinking .
Surprisingly , on the other hand , a speech too low is seen as an antisocial rule , and can be interpreted as an offense .
In Brazilian culture , if during a conversation a person speaks too low , the listener will assume that the speaker does not want to continue with the dialog or does not care about what you are talking .
In both the extremes of a speech , loud and low , there is a violation of the values of a good communication .
Therefore , when you are in a conversation , it is important to pay attention to execute with successful the unwritten rules of vocal patterns .
As vocal patterns are considered so important for Brazilians , personal territory is another unwritten rule that is easy to see people using on the streets daily .
When you are in a space that you feel comfortable being around other people that you do not know , this space is your personal territory .
And , it can change according to your degree of familiarity or intimate with the other person .
In some countries like the United States , whose respect of personal territory is extremely important , the public and the intimate space can vary between 25 feet and the touching ( Edward T. Hall ) .
In Brazil also there is this difference between the public and the intimate space , yet the magnitude of this is not the same of the U.S.
Although the Brazilians have a shorter personal space in comparison with the United States , they are no tolerant with strangers invading it .
Soon , even though the distance between people are shorter in Brazil , both countries value the idea of maintaining a space that both people feel comfortable , called personal space .
Although Brazilians usually do not worry about distance made by others , people from different cultures believe that Brazilians spend much time looking at others .
As a result , some people can make misinterpretations .
For example , in some cultures , Brazilians can be considered rude by women because they like to keep a constant eye contact , and for these women this means a lack of respect or invasion of privacy .
Differently , foreign men often believe that they are being desired due to this constant eye contact .
In general , this supposition is not regarded as true for many people in our culture since Brazilians believe that constant eye contact is one of the most important points to maintain a good dialog .
According to article " Nonverbal Communication : Speaking without Words " , eye contact is important because " insufficient eye contact can create communication barriers " .
In fact , in Brazil , the eye contact is primordial , being considered without interest to speaker or that the speaker is bothering you if you do not give enough attention when you are talking to .
The source of this rule is easy to be identified especially when the parents are talking to their kids ; it is hard to get exclusively the kid 's attention , but the parents insistently repeat , " look at me when I am talking to you " .
Therefore , this interaction demonstrates that the eye contact can have a strong influence in the cultural values of attentiveness and respect with the others ' opinion .
After being socially judged by the society , we can perceive the direct influence of unwritten rules in our cultural values when someone breaks at least one of them .
In Brazil , the social rules like vocal patterns reflect in the communication values which can be decisive to keep a good communication .
Also , the personal territory are governed by rules that vary depending on the country , and in Brazil are considered small , but everyone there appreciates this cultural value .
Eye contact is another important cultural value which is used by Brazilians meaning respect and interest for others .
As in Brazil , each country around the world has reflections of the unwritten rules in the cultural values .
Because of these varieties of values and rules , usually there are some misunderstandings between people of different nations .
Respecting these rules is the first step to understand them and avoid some conflicts .
In addition , you should avoid judge cultural values from other countries based on unwritten rules of your own .
It was a rainy Monday afternoon and Michael was gazing out the window thinking about his life , when he saw his friend , John , dashing through the street .
Wondering what he might be doing , Michael shouted :
- Why are you in such a hurry ?
- I 'm late for my piano lesson ! I really have to go , see you later - John replied panting .
- Oh , okay , bye !
Michael had a chemestry test the next day , however he was n't in the mood to study and so he decided to call Alex , his best friend :
- Hey Alex !
Do you want to go out ?
-
Yeah , sure !
Where should we meet ?
- How about the cafe near our school ?
- To be perfectly honest I do n't really like it there !
what about the one next to the shopping center ?
- Souds great .
See you there at half past six ?
- Ok , see you later then .
Michael grabbed his coat and creept out of his house in order not to wake up his parents .
He remembered that he still had n't studied for his chemestry test .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a terrible mistake .
According to Ferguson et all ( 2013 ) , dietary nitrate ( NO3- ) supplementation , via its reduction to nitrite ( NO2- ) and subsequent conversion to nitric oxide ( NO ) , reduces blood pressure .
Bond , Morton and Braakhuis ( 2012 ) also argue that nitrate is considered a potent vasodilator .
The reason for this is that the nitric oxide relaxes blood vessels and dilates them , which helps the blood flow more easily and lowers blood pressure .
Thus , the induced vasodilation may affect both systolic and diastolic blood pressure after the exercise .
Nevertheless , a study of The New England Journal of Medicine claims that only the diastolic blood pressure is affected by nitrate supplement , once it was not found in their study a significant change on systolic blood pressure after nitrate supplementation in healthy volunteers .
Surprisingly , the current study has found significant changes in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure post exercise .
Thus , the investment on research about the influence of nitrate supplementation should continue , the aim of which would be to improve sports performance and improved quality of life .
In conclusion , the results of the present study indicate that supplementation of beetroot juice has no significant effect on 700 m rowing ergometer performance .
It is unquestionable that some research found significant improvements .
In this present study , however , the rowing time of the participants was not shorter than times without supplementation .
Importantly , it was not found serious changes in blood lactate levels either .
It was assumed that beetroot juice would increase the oxidation and would reduce the lactate production .
Nevertheless , the nitrate supplementation did not change the lactate level significantly .
Finally , it was confirmed that nitric oxide relaxes blood vessels , consequently reducing the blood pressure .
By this action , beetroot juice may effectively protect the cardiovascular system during exercising .
Despite the present findings , it is necessary more research to understand the effects of nitrate supplementation .
By this action , athletes may improve their performance as well as quality of life .
Dear editor ,
I read your article about technology and education in the newspaper yesterday and I am writing this letter because I strongly disagree with your personal opinion about teachers and education .
Due to the fact that I am studying to become a teacher , I have some more knowledge about this subject than any other people because I am in the school classroom every day and I face the reality of it every day .
To begin with , I agree with you that technology sometimes makes the educational process easier and more pleasant in this way that students have no idea that they broaden their knowledge .
Of course , I make use of computer and projector during my teaching daily , because this is a pleasant and entertaining activity for children .
After all , my objection is that interactive learning is not the only way for children to be educated .
The traditional educational process may sometimes seem to be boring and dull for children but a teacher should be a part of this process as a guide .
Without teachers ' guidance , self- studying may bring some problems to children , such as possible misunderstanding .
Networking educational contents are not safe at all .
It is common for children to watch violence scenes .
So , the teacher is a necessary part of the educational process .
Nowadays , young people graduate from universities , who come up with new and innovative ideas about educational process and so the tradition will be updated next years .
To be more precise , new educational methods promotes the students ' teamwork .
In other words , students have the opportunity to discuss with their classmates in order to solve a mathematic problem in cooperation or to talk about a subject .
Furthermore , when it 's necessary good students can help the other classmates to improve themselves .
In this kind of education , teacher is only the guide who helps students to discover the information on their own .
Furthermore , it makes children more sociable .
In contrast , interactive learning may bring some advantages but it can also makes children antisocial , because they learn on their own without the need to be in the school with other people .
They do n't need to co - operate and to work as a team .
This is bad , because it will be necessary to work as team in their future job and then they will face serious communicative problems .
To sum up , I am not against interactive learning and the use of technology .
My personal opinion is this is not sufficient to cover the education process .
I think that it is efficient when there is a combination of traditional education and interactive learning .
The " Campo de Marte " sports centre
The " Campo de Marte " sports centre in Lima is the perfect place for young people who are keen on sports and for the ones who would like to take up a sport .
This is a good option especially during the summer time .
While doing these activities , teenagers will easily make new friends and develop new skills .
Also this is a healthy way of getting fit .
This sports centre provides a huge variety of physical activities .
One of these is athleticism . "
Campo de Marte " is one of the few places in Lima where you can practise athleticism professionally .
Besides , you have the chance to take part in international competitions if you stand out .
Another important activity is swimming .
You can practise it in a semi- Olympic swimming pool , which is always clean and protected against the sunlight .
However , during the winter it can be not warm enough to swim properly .
I strongly recommend young people to choose sports in which you can take part of a team .
This experience would teach you how to work with different kind of people .
Dear Mr Michael Wallis ,
Thank you so much for this opportunity , I am very grateful for everything .
I think English is in fact very important because first of all although not being the most spoken language in the world , it is the official language in a large number of countries .
Most of the content produced on the internet ( 50% ) is in English and last but not least although learning English can be challenging and steals some of our precious time , we can see that it is also very valuable to learn and can also create many opportunities .
About the accommodation , we talked and decided that we would prefer to be with English speaking families because of what a great opportunity it is for everyone to actually test their speaking skills .
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I am certain that we will cherish every second of every minute there .
I was actually about to email you about the activities that are to be planned .
Regarding the students preferences , they all love the outdoors , like parks and rivers and they also love a good museum because of their thirst for knowledge .
All in all , anything that will keep them away from being bored and with nothing to do .
Concerning this amazing trip I only have two questions left starting with the weather , considering your experience with the changes happening this time of the year and the second and last about what type of clothes you recommended which is of great importance primarily for our female students .
Yours sincerely
Margaret Dunn
I agree with the statement above to some extent .
On the positive side , travelling by car is more relaxed because you do not have to rely on others to drive for you .
Actually you have more freedom in which roads to choose and you can have breaks whenever you feel a need for some time off the street .
In addition , driving by yourself you are not limited by the stations you have to visit .
Going by train for example , you need to get to the next train station and afterwards from the destination train station to your target .
Often enough you have to rely on other services such as busses or taxis to reach your destination .
On the other hand , using public transportation is good for the environment because the amount of gas , electricity and other materials is a lot lower per head .
Furthermore you have the chance to take a nap , do some work or watch TV while you are being transported .
Moreover you can be lucky to avoid big traffic jams especially if you are taking the train .
Avoiding traffic jams , construction sites , accidents and other obstacles you may being affected by may result in a lower amount of time spent travelling .
As a conclusion you can say public transport will have its use even in the future . While going by car may be more comfortable from time to time , the reasons I stated above lead me to the conclusion that public transport is necessary .
It is popularly believed that the golden era of public transportation will be ended soon due to the heavy use of automobiles such as cars , cabs and vans .
Public transportation modes like trains and buses have been immensely helpful to the general public throughout the past couple of decades .
On the other hand , travelling by car is getting for popular than it ever was with development of science and technology .
People who are based on rural and remote areas are always prefer to use public transportation according to the researchers from Columbia University .
However , in some countries , public transportation is a nightmare because it has not been maintained by the governments properly , this is one of the main reasons which had led people to use personal vehicles rather than relying on public transportation .
Not only people in countries where it has poor public transportation but also the most developed countries , there is a high tendency of using cars instead of depending on public transportation .
Despite the fact that using cars being expensive , many people still prefer to use their own vehicles because it saves their valuable time .
Public transportation , on the other hand , consumes a lot of time to travel from one distance to another .
Use of high power efficiency and linear high power amplifier ( HPAs ) are growing .
Power efficiency and linearity are important factors in many applications such as cellular communication , wireless communication .
Higher power efficiency and linearity cause decrease power consumption , increase lifetime and reduction of interference channels .
Class - E power amplifier satisfies those goals with linearity techniques .
Class - E power amplifier PAs work as a switch and can obtain theoretically 100% power efficiency . Class - E power amplifier ( PA ) was introduced by Sokal in 1975 .
These PAs work as a switch and can obtain 100% Drain Efficiency theoretically .
However in practice there are some limitations such as , switch on - resistance and various power losses that prevent achieving 100% Drain Efficiency .
Secret agents have often been chosen as the main character of stories and films , such as James Bond 's ones , which managed to be really successful .
But what exactly makes spy stories so fascinating ?
There could be a lot of reasons , like the idea of living in an adventurous way or doing things in secret ; but in real life , what kind of person does a secret agent have to be ?
First of all , being a spy requires special skills ; not everybody is suitable for this kind of life .
For instance , the ability to bear both physical and psychological stress is not something you can easily learn .
In the same way a secret agent has to be able to take risks when required .
Therefore bravery is very important : nobody needs a fearful spy .
A secret agent works undercover , so his most important quality is possessing great skill in lying .
Besides , since his work is secret , he ca n't let anybody , including family and friends , know about it .
So , although the life of secret agents may seem fascinating and exciting , it is also difficult and risky and not so simple as the one shown in films .
